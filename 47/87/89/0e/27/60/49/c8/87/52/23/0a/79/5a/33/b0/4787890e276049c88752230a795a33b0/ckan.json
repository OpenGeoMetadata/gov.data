    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set, part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, provides the first comprehensive, high-resolution, digital mosaics of ice motion in Antarctica assembled from multiple satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar data. Data were acquired during the International Polar Year 2007 to 2009. \n\nThese maps were built from spring 2009 data from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA)'s and MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA)'s RADARSAT-2, spring 2007-2008-2009 data from European Space Agency (ESA)'s Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR), and fall 2007-2008 data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)'s Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), complemented by patches of CSA's RADARSAT-1 data from fall 2000 and ESA's Earth Remote Sensing Satellites ERS-1 and -2 data from spring 1996. Each radar instrument contributes its unique coverage and performance level. The final mosaics assemble 900 satellite tracks and more than 3,000 orbits of radar data. Data acquisitions between 2006 and 2011 are courtesy of the IPY Space Task Group. \n\nData are available via FTP at 450 m and 900 m spacings, in both binary format (.dat) with an ENVI text header (.txt) and NetCDF.\n\nNote. These data are considered provisional pending a review by the MEaSUREs program. Once the data have been reviewed, this statement will be removed from this documentation.",
