    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The research proposed targets airframe noise (AFN) prediction and reduction. AFN originates from complex interactions of turbulent flow with airframe components that are extremely difficult to compute efficiently and accurately. In Phase I the feasibility of an innovative generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) approach as a computational aeroacoustics (CAA) tool was evaluated.  A subgrid scale (SGS) with wall damping was introduced into the GLBE to enable large eddy simulations.  GLBE results on wall turbulence statistics compared well with direct numerical simulations and experiments. The GLBE approach, which uses multiple relaxation times, was significantly more stable than, and as computationally efficient as, the more common single-relaxation time LBE at high Reynolds numbers. It was also computationally competitive with finite-difference methods on single processors, but GLBE had the major advantage of scaling near-linearly on large parallel computers. GLBE computations also accurately reproduced the tonal frequencies for cross-flow over a single, and a pair of cylinders, and feedback-generated tonal frequencies for flow over cavities, which are CAA benchmarks for AFN.  With feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, further developments of GLBE, including innovative use of wall-layer models, dynamic SGS models, improved boundary condition implementation and grid refinement strategies in Phase II would enable simulations of very high Reynolds number CAA problems of complex geometry with high fidelity. The GLBE approach developed will then be interfaced to an existing far-field acoustics prediction code to efficiently address AFN in configurations of interest, including high-lift systems and landing gear.\r\n",
