    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Failure prognosis - as a natural extension to the fault detection and isolation (FDI) problem - has become a key issue in a world where the economic impact of system reliability and cost-effective operation of critical assets is steadily increasing. Failure prognostic algorithms aim to characterize the evolution of incipient fault conditions in complex dynamic processes, thus allowing to estimate of the remaining useful life (RUL) of subsystems and components. Several examples can be used here to illustrate the range of possible applications for these algorithms: electro-mechanical systems, continuous-time manufacturing processes, structural damage analysis, and even fault tolerant\r\nsoftware architectures. Most of them have in common the fact that they are highly complex, nonlinear, and affected by large-grain uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWe introduce in this chapter an integrated failure prognosis architecture that is applicable to a variety of aircraft systems and industrial processes. We are targeting a specific rotorcraft system as a prototypical testbed for proof-of-concept. The overall architecture consists of an on-board and an off-board module for eventual on-platformimplementation purposes.",
