    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of the Phase-I research is to design a multi-GHz high bandwidth Delta Sigma Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog converter using a deep sub-micron CMOS process. Since the Delta Sigma Modulation ADC samples in the multi-GHz range, direct sampling and conversion to digital of post LNA Microwave signals is possible. By targeting the ADC on a CMOS technology node (90nm, 65nm or 45nm), a complete all digital radio receiver and demodulator can be implemented on the same System on a Chip that performs host interface and higher network level protocols. Using Delta Sigma Modulation at GHz sampling rates eliminates the anti-aliasing filter requirement.  The all digital receiver eliminates I/Q imbalance due to the receiver and DC offset introduced by zero-IF architectures. In order to support multi GHz sampling rates in CMOS, advanced time interleaving, parallel Delta Sigma Modulators and shared integrator architectures are considered. Using Micro-RDC RHBD cells and design experience the digital filtering and decimation of the high frequency bit stream are hardened. The baseband filtering is implemented with temporal latch technology for SEU immunity. In this research various hardening techniques will be used to harden the analog sub-components in the Delta Sigma Modulator including investigating pipelining and parallel processing architectures for filtering and decimation which also address low power requirements.",
