    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a Selective Photoinitiated Electrophoretic Separator (SPIES) System to address NASA's volatile gas separation and collection needs on the moon and Mars. It will process gas streams generated by upstream lunar in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) processes to produce purified gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and others that support human habitat here. The SPIES system, consisting of a series of compact (&lt;20 cm diameter, 60 cm long, &lt;5 kg) and energy efficient (&lt;30 W) modules, produces highly purified gases of interest at ambient temperatures and pressures, requires no consumables, and eliminates the need for extensive downstream equipment thus, reducing equipment launch size and weight by 33&#37;. In Phase I, POC designed and assembled a proof-of-concept prototype of technology readiness level (TRL) 4 that successfully demonstrated purification of simulated lunar ISRU hydrogen gas streams by gas separation and extraction to reduce hydrogen sulfide contamination to &lt;1 part per million (ppm). In Phase II, POC will optimize the system design to assemble a fully functional TRL 5 SPIES system prototype that will efficiently reduce the hydrogen sulfide concentration to &lt;1 ppm in a realistic gas stream like those generated by NASA's hydrogen reformate process.",
