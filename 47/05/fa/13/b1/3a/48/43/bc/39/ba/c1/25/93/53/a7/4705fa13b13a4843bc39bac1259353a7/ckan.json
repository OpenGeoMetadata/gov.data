    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The S-band Profiler Raw dataset was saved in two data formats: netCDF anda proprietary Vaisala SPC format. The numeric values in both formats are exactly the same.  The S-band Profiler Raw dataset in the netCDF format was gathered during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) in Oklahoma April-June 2011 and consists of uncalibrated Doppler velocity spectra data in units of relative power return.  The S-band 2.8 GHz profiler points vertically and measures the backscattered power from raindrops and ice particles as precipitating cloud systems pass overhead.  The profiler processes radar pulses during a 7-second dwell before calculating and saving uncalibrated Doppler velocity spectra at each range gate that were separated by 60-meters in the vertical.  Data collected during each hour are saved in two files.  All precipitation mode profiles are saved in one hourly data file and all attenuated mode profiles are saved in another hourly data file.  After calibration, calibrated data can be obtained from the S-band Original Dwell and Minute datasets.",
