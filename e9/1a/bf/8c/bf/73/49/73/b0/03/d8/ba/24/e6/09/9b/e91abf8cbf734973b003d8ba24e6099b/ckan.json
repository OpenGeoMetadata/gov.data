  "notes": "Ruby Lake NWR 1991 Annual Water Management Report 1992 Annual Water Management Plan. Includes Ruby Lake 1991 weather summary, summary of 1991 water levels, water availability forecast, and 1992 water management objectives. For a seventh consecutive year northeastern Nevada received below average precipitation. Total precipitation (rain and water content of snow) for 1991 was 12.06 inches (Table 1) which is 2.33 inches more than received during 1990 and 1.32 inches below the average of the past 10 years. Snow accumulation during 1991 totaled 28.8 inches, 4.4 inches above the total for 1990 and 2.3 inches below the average of the past 10 years. Precipitation received during 1991 may appear to be near the 10 year average, however, because of the mathematical bias caused by below average precipitation for the past 5 years, the 10 year average does not reflect the longer term precipitation average. The Soil Conservation Service March 1991 snow survey showed the Ruby Mountains snowpack water content at 60 percent of average. Unseasonable rain and snow storms which occurred after 1 March slightly increased the basin water content. Average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures during 1991 were below the 10 year average and evaporation was 8.48 inches below the 10 year average. Despite below average temperatures and evaporation, continued low water levels and lack of sufficient snowpack contributed to the lowest water levels recorded on the Refuge since 1961. By July, there was no water at Narciss Boat Landing and by the end of August it was extremely difficult to launch boats at Main Boat Landing. If drought conditions continue, the water level in the South Sump may once again reach the record low of 1961 when the marsh decreased to a size of approximately 20 acres.",
