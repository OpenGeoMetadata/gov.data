    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Airborne gamma surveys were conducted over each of the three Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) Meso-cell Study Areas (MSAs) in northern Colorado, USA, during September 2001 and 2002, and during the three Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) in February 2002 (IOP1), February 2003 (IOP3) and March 2003 (IOP4). Data collected in September 2001 and 2002 provided background gamma radiation measurements necessary to calculate measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture during subsequent winters. Airborne gamma radiation measurements of SWE and soil moisture are based on the attenuation of natural terrestrial gamma radiation by the mass of water contained in the soil and snow. Measurements were collected at 500 feet AGL along flight lines of variable length and 300 m width. Measurements are integrated along the entire length of a flight line. Flight lines in the North Park MSA were each 9 km in length, with a series of three lines (27 km total length) flown in a regular N-S parallel pattern spaced 1 km apart. Flight lines in the Fraser and Rabbit Ears MSAs are of variable length and direction. \n\nThe NASA CLPX is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage, and transformations to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging from 1-ha to 160,000 km2, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations are collected. Data collection focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions are generally frozen and dry, and early spring, a transitional period when both frozen and thawed, dry and wet conditions are widespread.",
