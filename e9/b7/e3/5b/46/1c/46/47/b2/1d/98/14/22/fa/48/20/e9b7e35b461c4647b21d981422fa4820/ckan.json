    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Both manned and unmanned off-Earth missions of the future will require very lightweight, high efficiency, flexible and durable photovoltaic (PV) arrays to generate electric power.  Current PV technology horizons do not meet the requirements for expanded mission capability.  Although inorganic PVs hold the record for solar power conversion efficiency, they are inflexible, heavy, and expensive to produce.  There is increasing interest in a new type of PV technology that is based on organic semiconducting materials.  Much of this research has been limited by the availability of stable n-type organic semiconductors.  TDA Research, Inc. proposes to use a new class of n-type conjugated polymers to produce more efficient organic PV devices.  Two of our new n-type materials are available through Sigma-Aldrich, and the current technology readiness level (TRL) stands at 3 with proof-of-concept results and commercial sales.  At the end of this Phase I project we will have produced prototype organic PVs in the laboratory (TRL 4) and a successful Phase II project would lead to several commercial n-type organic semiconductor products being used in the full scale production of lightweight flexible PVs (TRL 6).",
