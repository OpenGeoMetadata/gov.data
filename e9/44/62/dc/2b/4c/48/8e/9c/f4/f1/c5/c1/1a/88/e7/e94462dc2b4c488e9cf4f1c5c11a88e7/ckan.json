    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The focus of this analysis was the development of a complex geometry test fixture and test method for determining solvent cleaning efficiency. AK-225 belongs to a class of chemicals called HCFC and is used for cleaning, drying and lubricant deposition applications. These compounds are regulated by the U.S Clean Air Act and can no longer be produced or imported into the United states.&amp;nbsp; Any alternative solvent must be able to dissolve the soil/contaminant on the part.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The determination of an environmentally safe but reliable quality cleaning solvent is critical to Stennis propulsion test operations.&amp;nbsp; A detailed methodology for determining the replacement solvent was devised and implemented during this project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In reality, parts undergoing cleaning are not able to be inspected internally to determine a cleanliness level.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, a test rig that could be disassembled with complicated internal geometry was made using several computer aided design iterations. The test fixture disassembly allows for the inspection of the internals following the use of the cleaning solvent.&amp;nbsp; The contamination solution is made of various items that are used in the propulsion test environment.&amp;nbsp; Upon &amp;ldquo;dirtying&amp;rdquo; the test rig, a thorough post processing inspection exercise procedure was devised to be used when evaluating alternative solvents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
