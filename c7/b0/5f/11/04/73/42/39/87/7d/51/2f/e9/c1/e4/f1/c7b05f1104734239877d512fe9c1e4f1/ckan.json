    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "  GTL has already made substantial progress in developing and validating the BHL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; technology for application to cryotanks.  Earlier coupon testing of the temperature-dependent material properties confirmed the potential of the BHL technology to eliminate the microcracking issue.  This was followed by the fabrication and cryo-pressure cycle testing of small BHL cylinders.  No laminate leaks or degradation were detected in a test with more than 40 cryo-pressure cycles.\r\n  While other efforts are exploring the reliability aspects of the BHL technology at larger scales, the proposed effort will focus on evaluating the long-term cryogenic propellant storage capabilities of the BHL technology.  Specifically, this effort will include initial tests to examine the implications of long-term oxygen exposure on the BHL laminate as the first step towards validating the technology for long-term NASA exploration and other missions.  \r\n  The effort will also refine the BHL laminate design to optimize it for long-term cryogenic propellant storage.  This will include an effort to increase the insulating capability of the structural laminate to minimize the need for secondary insulation.  A small BHL cylinder shall be fabricated using these refinements as a proof-of-concept.",
