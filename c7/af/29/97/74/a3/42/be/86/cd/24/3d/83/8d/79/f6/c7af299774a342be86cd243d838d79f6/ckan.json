    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set represents a refined set of global net primary productivity (NPP) estimates and model driver data that are the results of the Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) workshop review and outlier analyses undertaken to assess the accuracy of global model forecasts of terrestrial carbon cycling. EMDI builds upon the accomplishments of the original worldwide synthesis of NPP measurements and associated model driver data prepared by the Global Primary Production Data Initiative (GPPDI) (Olson et al., 2001; 2012). The EMDI review and analyses produced NPP, climate, NDVI, land cover, vegetation, and soil data for a sub-set of GPPDI data: 81 Class A sites, 933 Class B sites, and 3,855 Class C 0.5 degree cell grids. Class A sites represent well-documented study sites that have complete above- and below-ground NPP measurements. Class B sites represent more numerous extensive sites with less documentation and site-specific information available. Class C cells represent estimates of NPP for 0.5 degree grid cells for which inventory, modeling, or remote-sensing tools were used to scale up the point measurements.The data files in the EMDI database are in comma-separated-value (.csv) format. There are 582 data files for Class A sites, 11 data files for Class B sites, and 9 data files for Class C grid cells. This document and a companion file (Olson et al., 2001) describe the compilation of NPP estimates under the GPPDI and the EMDI review and outlier analyses that produced this refined set of NPP estimates and model driver data.",
