  "notes": "Thirty emergent, seasonally to semi-permanently flooded wetlands in an intensively farmed area of west central Minnesota were sampled before and during the 1992 crop growing season to determine surface water concentrations of three widely used herbicide groups. Specifically, water obtained from ten isolated wetlands (“reference”) on Federal Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs), four WPA “treatment\" wetlands, and 16 privately owned \"treatment\" wetlands was analyzed to determine whether, and to what extent, wetland basins both adjacent to, and isolated from, private agricultural lands contained measurable concentrations of alachlor, triazine and phenoxy acid herbicides. Surface water samples were screened for the three class herbicide types using enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Low concentrations of all three herbicide classes were detected in surface waters from WPA “reference” wetlands. The range of triazine concentrations detected within the ten “reference” WPAs was 0.019-0.546 parts per billion (ppb), whereas alachlor and phenoxy acid concentration ranges were 0.048-0.432 ppb and 0.004-0.764 ppb, respectively. Presently, herbicide occurrence at these concentrations has not been shown to adversely impact aquatic macrophytes or invertebrates. Triazine and alachlor concentrations in some “treatment” WPA ditches and private wetlands (4.17 and 5.27 ppb triazine 2.41 and 6.56 ppb alachlor, respectively) were similar and exceeded maximum concentrations in “reference” WPA wetlands. Phenoxy acid herbicide concentrations in privately owned wetlands (0.000-1.100 ppb) and “treatment” (0.003-0.193 ppb) and “reference” WPA wetlands were found to have similar low concentrations. Alachlor and triazine herbicide concentrations in the \"treatment\" wetlands suggest at minimum, the potential for aquatic toxicity, as indicated under laboratory conditions, and help define additional directions for assessment of pesticide exposure and related toxic effects to prairie pothole aquatic life.",
