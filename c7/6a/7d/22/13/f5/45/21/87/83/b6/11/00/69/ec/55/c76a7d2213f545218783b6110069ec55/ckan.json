This layer was initally based on the State of Connecticut, Department of Environmental Protection Connecticut Town Polygon layer (CONNECTICUT_TOWN_POLY)OSET) which was compiled at 1:24000 scale.The eight State Police PSAPs are not represented within this layer because their \"boundaries\" are based on cell phone sectors and not political boundaires.PSAPs are the facilities operated on a twenty-four hour basis, which are for receiving 9-1-1 calls and dispatching emergency response services, or transferring or relaying 9-1-1 calls to other public safety agencies. Emergency response services include police, fire and emergency medical services. The PSAP is the first point of reception of a 9-1-1 call.Connecticut has four types of PSAPs: Municipal (covers one municipality), Multi-Town (covers two muncipalities), Regional (covers at least three municipalities), or State Police (covers certain highways and roads).",
