  "notes": "A one 1000 ml (one Liter) water sample was collected every 20 days at 2 hour and 4 minute intervals for 2 complete tidal cycles (26 hours) with an ISCO automated water sampler at a depth of 0.5 meters below the water's surface. The water samples were brought into the lab and analyzed for salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, and nitrate-nitrite), phosphorus (total and dissolved and ortho phosphate), dissolved organic carbon, suspended sediment (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, organic suspended sediment), and suspended sediment color. Tide stage based on published NOAA tide charts for each sample were also included in the database. Samples were simultaneously collected from three of the four sample sites. Three sites are located in salt marsh tidal creeks found in the North Inlet Estuary. These samples are taken at the end of Oyster Landing dock (OL) in Crab Haul Creek, the upper reaches of Debidue Creek (DC) near the boundary between Hobcaw Barony and the Debordieu Colony, and Clambank Landing Dock (CB) in Clambank Creek. The other site is located adjacent to the Winyah Bay Estuary. The Thousand Acre (TA) samples are taken near the mouth of a small tidal creek that connects the Thousand Acre Rice Field to Winyah Bay. For more information on the sample sites, see the Description of Geographic Extent Section.",
