    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are routinely used while designing, analyzing, and optimizing air- and spacecraft.  An important component of CFD simulations is mesh generation, or discretization into polygonal or polyhedral cells, of the domain being analyzed.  The overall computational cost and accuracy of simulations depend heavily on mesh quality ? the size, shape, and structure of the cells.  Another important aspect of CFD simulation is that solutions are achieved iteratively, with each subsequent pass decreasing error and increasing solution accuracy.  Grid adaption uses output from the last simulation to improve the mesh for the next.  FUN3D is a CFD simulator developed at NASA that requires both a tight integration with mesh generation software for grid adaption and the generation of high aspect ratio cells (i.e. 10,000:1) to accurately capture dynamics around boundary layers.\r\nCurrent meshing methods use the well known advancing front or Delaunay algorithms, and the user must often perform multiple manual inputs and interactions to generate a mesh of sufficient quality.  Ideally, a meshing module would subdivide complex designs and perform grid adaption automatically, with little or no human intervention.  The proposed innovation is the development of a very high aspect ratio mesher that demonstrates a significant improvement over current techniques as measured by the time and effort necessary for FUN3D users to solve CFD problems.",
