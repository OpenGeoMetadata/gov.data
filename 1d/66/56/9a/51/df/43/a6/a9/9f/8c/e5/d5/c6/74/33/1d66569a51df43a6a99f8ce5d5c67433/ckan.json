    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Dielectric spectrometry will be performed on select spacecraft materials (i.e. heat shield materials, structural materials and insulating foams) to examine their capacitance and permittivity under controlled humidity. Three types of samples will be tested for each selected material, a dry, defect free sample, samples with known defects and moisture levels, and samples of unknown condition as a test of validity. Tests will be conducted from three microhertz to three gigahertz at temperatures ranging from -160&amp;deg;C to 400&amp;deg;C in order to obtain a full dielectric profile. The complex dielectric spectra acquired will be analyzed using computational modeling in order to determine the fit parameters associated with that material. These dielectric spectra and computational models will be used as the basis for proposals for new capacitance three-dimensional permittivity mapping sensor systems for monitoring structural health, extending a material&amp;rsquo;s lifetime in high humidity environments (like those of Florida) and in forming improved repair processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Novocontrol Concept 80 Broadband Dielectric Spectrometry system will be used to measure the complex dielectric spectrum for select spaceflight materials.&amp;nbsp; Samples with known defects will be measured to serve as a comparison to known good samples.&amp;nbsp; Materials that are known to have problems with moisture absorption will be measured after exposure to different moisture levels to see how the complex permittivities vary with moisture content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis will be performed on the spectra to determine the extent to which damage and moisture can be quantified for each of the materials.&amp;nbsp; Concepts for new NDE techniques and sensors will be proposed based on the results of the analysis.&amp;nbsp;Materials targeted to be tested include heat shield materials, such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator&lt;strong&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;PICA), Avocat, and high performance polymers.&lt;/p&gt;",
