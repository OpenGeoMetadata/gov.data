    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We believe our approach to gathering and organizing prognostics V&V information from relevant literature, and then applying it to our specific prognostics application, provides a novel methodological way to approach V&V. Conventional literature surveys have a different purpose – they attempt to distill general themes, offer comparisons and contrasts, etc. Our intention was to provide an aid that allows the application of knowledge gleaned from the literature. It also allows the user to break down the V&V process into smaller segments and to identify potential bottlenecks which then allow focusing the attention. The specific approach we took to organizing the information – into categories of “Barriers” and “Solutions”, where each is accompanied by explanatory text from the original sources, coupled with references to the sources themselves – seems to have worked reasonably well overall. There are aspects that could be improved; the descriptive text recorded proved on occasion to be insufficient to serve as a standalone explanation of the item in question – fairly often we found the need to trace back to the original source and read more of the explanatory context; the reference to the source helped, but still meant a somewhat cumbersome process; we also feel it would have been better to have taken the time to record a reference back from an item (Barrier or Solution) to all the sources where that item, or its equivalent, were discussed; the overall hierarchical organization of these items (see Appendix for the listing of their titles) could probably be improved upon. What we found to be most useful was to use the Barriers as a series of talking points, taking notes as we went along as to our prognostics experts' understanding of whether, and if so how, that Barrier applied to our application. This process both serves as a means to capture the rationale that justifies faith in the prognostics application's approach, and to stimulate (and again capture) thoughts on areas of concern and possible approaches to addressing them.",
