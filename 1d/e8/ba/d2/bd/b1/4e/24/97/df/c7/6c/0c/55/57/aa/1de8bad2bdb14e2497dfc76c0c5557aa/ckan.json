    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe proposed workshop is innovative in that it explores the use of additive manufacturing for the fabrication of hardware. Currently, all additive manufacturing techniques are in the early stages of development, both commercially and at other NASA centers. This technology, which includes processes like LENS, e-beam welding, and ultra-sonic additive manufacturing, aims to reduce the need for machining metal parts from large billets by creating net or near-net shapes using only the metal required for the final part. In 2012, JPL R&amp;amp;TD is funding the development of a novel steel-Invar alloy that is included in this proposal as the weld connection between a steel bench and an Invar optical mount. By tuning the composition of the gradient alloy to the prototype hardware, the thermal expansion between the two can be predicted and controlled. This will eliminate the need for brazing or fastening hardware, reduce the stresses associated with thermal-cyclic fatigue, and improve reliability. The fabrication of such a gradient alloy by traditional metallurgical techniques is not possible. The LENS technique offers the additional ability to fabricate net and near-net shape components from the gradient alloy, limiting the need for machining, by laser depositing the constituent metals at independently controlled rates via the LENS system&amp;rsquo;s computer-controlled multi-nozzle feature. The resulting part is fully dense, has a gradient transition from one alloy to another, and is tough (free of cracks and brittle intermetallic phases). The workshop is a natural evolution advancement from the current project because it will utilize the new material in optical packaging and other applications that are plagued with design challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
