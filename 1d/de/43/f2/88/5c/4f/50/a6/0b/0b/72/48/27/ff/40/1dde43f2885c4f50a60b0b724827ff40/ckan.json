  "notes": " \n        Our goal is to propose the most rigorous and feasible evaluation design that answers the following research questions of interest to MCC: \n\nAGRICULTURE PRODUCTION\nHave there been changes in the amount of land used for agricultural production? Is land being used for production in different seasons than before?* \nHas crop production improved? Have production methods, including the choice of inputs, changed? Have there been changes to the types of crops produced?*\nWhat factors are contributing to or constraining changes in agriculture inputs and production? Why are households changing or not changing agriculture production decisions, and how do those reasons vary depending on crop type, growing season, or income level?**\nHow have changes differed by gender and among different income levels?*\n\nUSE AND AVAILABILITY OF WATER\nHave there been changes in the sources of water used for agricultural production?* \nHow has water availability changed, and have barriers or costs to accessing irrigation been reduced? Has the water supply become more reliable?**\nHas the amount of irrigated land increased?* \nHas the role of WUAs changed and how do they impact the use and availability of water?**\n\nINCOME\nHave household income levels changed, including changes in components of household income, and has income shifted between agricultural and nonagricultural sources?* **\nDo farmers perceive an improvement in their living standards?** \nHave agricultural profits changed?*\n\nLAND SECURITY AND CONFLICTS\nHave perceptions of land tenure security changed? Is there increased confidence in the land tenure system? If so, why?* **\nHas the extent of land formalization changed? Is there greater awareness of the process for formalizing land?* **\nHas demand changed for formalized land rights and are the costs of formalizing land rights perceived as reasonable?**\nHas the number or severity of land conflicts reduced? Has the type or nature of land conflicts changed?* **\nHow has the IWRM Project affected women's access to land and irrigation? How has it affected the landless?** \nHow have changes in land security perceptions, formalization, conflict, or conflict management affected investments on land?**\nWhat have been the constraints or barriers to land access? Do these differ depending on gender, income levels, or age?**\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE\nHave local government agencies become more effective at land management, including land allocation, land formalization, and conflict resolution? Is there greater confidence in the efficacy of these institutions?**\nDo institutions receive adequate support to carry out their functions?** \n\nSUSTAINABILITY AND EXTERNAL IMPACTS\nWhat are the prospects for the sustainability of project activities post-Compact?**\nWhat impacts did the project have outside of project areas?**\nWho benefitted from each IWRM activity? Where and when did each activity occur?**\n\n* = Impact analysis using a difference-in-differences methodology\n**=Descriptive outcomes and implementation analysis using qualitative and quantitative methods\n\nWe will address these research questions by using two key analytical methods, as noted in the research question list above. For some research questions, we will employ an impact analysis that uses a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the causal effects of some IWRM Project activities. Through this approach, we will compare beneficiaries (the treatment group) to nonbeneficiaries (the comparison group) before and after the intervention, using existing baseline data and data we plan to collect through two follow-up survey rounds. Due to differences between the two regions and in activities implemented, we will analyze impacts of the project separately for the Delta and Podor intervention areas, using the household as our unit of analysis.\n \nWe also will conduct a descriptive outcomes and implementation analysis that uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to address additional questions of interest to complement the impact analysis. These include questions about activities that occurred before the baseline survey and those that occurred at the commune level and may have had commune-wide or institutional effects. We will also use mixed methods to examine the mechanisms that brought about project impacts and to better interpret the estimates produced through the DID analysis. For example, if we find that commune-level activities affected outcomes for both the treatment group and a portion of the comparison group, our DID impact estimates will not be able to capture the effects of these activities; instead, we will examine those commune-level activities and their effects qualitatively. Our mixed-methods analysis will draw on an array of data sources, including the household and community surveys, project documentation, secondary literature, and administrative data provided by MCC and local government agencies. In addition, we will conduct key informant interviews and focus groups with project stakeholders and beneficiary groups.\n      ",
