  "notes": "Environmental Justice (EJ) areas in Region 8 . This dataset was derived from 2000 census data and based on the criteria setforth in the Region 8 Interim Environmental Justice Policy. The two criteria for Region 8's EJ demographic analysis are percent poverty and percent minority. The percent minority and percent poverty numbers for each blockgroup are compared to the benchmark value for the state. Census blockgroups with percent poverty or percent minority higher than the state threshold are considered potential EJ areas. The cutoffs for each state were derived by using the statistical method - cluster analysis. Cluster analysis was chosen as the most objective way of evaluating the demographic data and determining cutoff values for minority and low income. With cluster analysis, data are divided into two distinct groups (e.g., minority and non-minority, and low income and non-low income). Cluster analysis examines natural breaks of the data. Separate analyses were conducted for minority and low income, respectively, for each State. All census block groups within a State were ranked in descending order according to the demographic factor under evaluation. This resulted in a ranking for percent minority by block group and a separate ranking for percent low income by block group. An iterative process was employed where the data were (1) split into two groups; (2) the means for each of the two groups were calculated; (3) the difference between the means for each group was determined; and (4) Steps 1- 3 were repeated until the greatest difference between the means was found. This method results in dividing the data into two groups that are as different as possible.",
