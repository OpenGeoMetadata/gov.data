  "notes": "  Description: This facility is configured to safely conduct experimental pressuregain combustion research. The DERF is capable of supporting up to 60,000 lbf thrust experiments, with integrated remote control and instrumentation systems. Pulsed thrust measurements from 3 to 1,000+ lbf are made with a damped thrust stand mounted on the existing engine thrust stand. A hardened remote-control room is adjacent to the 750,000+ cu.ft. test cell. Control of all detonation engine operations and data acquisition is done via a computer-based interface integrated into a &amp;quot;virtual instrument/control system&amp;quot; with back-up manual shutdown and safety systems. The facility control system is extremely flexible and can control all aspects of detonation engine operation including: lubrication, operating valve drive motor speed, fuel flow, main combustion air flow, purge air flow, timing, ignition delays, and automatic shutdown in the event of a critical system failure. In addition to conventional data acquisition and control systems, the facility is equipped with up to 16 channels of high-frequency data acquisition at up to 5 MHz. Up to 1 Mhz framing rate digital imaging is also available for advanced laser diagnostics and imaging techniques. The PDE research engine was developed and is used for performance validation and as a test-bed for research of detonation initiation, fuel injection (including endothermic/regenerative fuel cooling), valving, controls, materials, heat transfer/thermal management, multi-tube effects, nozzles, ejectors, hybrid turbine engines, acoustics, power extraction, emissions, and diagnostics. Up to 6 pps of airflow is available continuously at up to 100 psig and 15,000 pounds of high pressure (up to 2200 psi) air available for shorter durations. Oxygen and nitrous oxide are approved as alternative oxidizers. For self aspirated engines, 200+ pps air intake is available with supporting ambient exhaust (14.3 psia). A small-scale steam ejector system provides vacuum capability to 3 psia for low flow rates. Vapor and liquid fuel systems encompass nearly every fuel utilized for airbreathing propulsion (from hydrogen to advanced bio-fuels) with direct connection to the liquid fuel farm for larger flow rates. The facility drainage is isolated with a fuel segregator, and a three-zone Cardox system provide environmental protection along with gas monitoring for fuels, CO and NOx.  Purpose: The primary object of the facility is the research and development of pressure-gain combustion including pulsed detonation engines (PDEs) and rotary (or rotating) detonation engines (RDEs). The in-house PDE program was established in order to make AFRL&amp;#39;s unique resources available for the development of this technology. In order to work with pulsed and rotary detonation phenomena, AFRL has set out to develop the facilities, diagnostics, modeling tools, and experience necessary to contribute and provide unique resources for the maturation of pressure-gain combustion technology.  Products: PDE and PDE hybrid performance 4-tube research PDE that has been operated with over 20 different fuels and hundreds of detonation tube geometries. Other pressure gain combustion devices include pulsejets, single and multi-tube PDE&amp;#39;s, rotary detonation engines, and a 7-tube rotary valved PDE. Component technology products include: aircraft structural/acoustic interaction validation, unsteady ejector/nozzle technology, endothermic/regenerative fuel cooling, detonation initiation and transition technology as well as small-scale internal combustion and turbine engine research.
