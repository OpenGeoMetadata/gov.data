  "notes": "Sediment samples were collected from ten locations along Shoal Creek and analyzed for l9 metals and 20 organochlorine compounds. For the organic analyses, hexachlorobenzene was the only chemical detected (0.044 ppm, wet weight). It was found at Shoal Creek Milepoint 32.1 (Site 3). Barium, beryllium, and manganese concentrations were greatest at Rigsby Hollow (Site 7) located near the Murray-Ohio Superfund Site. Cadmium, lead, molybdenum, selenium, and vanadium were highest at Shoal Creek Milepoint 56 (Site 5), which was located near the Lawrenceburg Water Department intake. Arsenic, boron, iron, magnesium, and strontium concentrations were greatest at Shoal Creek Milepoint 51.7 (Site 10) located about two miles downstream from the former Horseshoe Bend Superfund Site, and also downstream of the new Shoal Creek Dam. Shoal Creek Milepoint 46.1 (Site 4), located at Shoal Creek Road Bridge, had the highest concentrations of aluminum, chromium, copper, mercury, and nickel. Cadmium (0.20-0.32 ppm) and molybdenum (1.20-1.70 ppm) concentrations were fairly uniform throughout the study area. Mercury (0.012-0.118 ppm) was detected at every site; however, the average concentration upstream of Rigsby Hollow (0.032 ppm) was one-half that for the downstream sites. Eleven metals (aluminum, arsenic, boron, cadmium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, strontium, and zinc) were lowest at the two sites located furthest downstream (Iron City and Goose Shoals). Maximum concentrations for all l9 metals were found within the 14 mile segment from Shoal Creek Milepoint 56 to Milepoint 42. Manganese and nickel exceeded Canadian limits of tolerance or severe effect levels at Rigsby Hollow, and also exceeded Canadian lowest effect levels at four and six additional sites, respectively. If suitable habitat is present, initial mussel/fish relocations should occur downstream of Milepoint 42. In addition, the following items are recommended for consideration in any future investigations of Shoal Creek: (1) determine contaminant residues in nonlisted mussel species which are co-located with listed species; (2) conduct larval and juvenile mussel toxicity tests using sediment and water from Shoal Creek; (3) measure contaminants in water and sediment in conjunction with toxicity tests; (4) utilize cholinesterase inhibition assays on nonlisted mussel species; (5) analyze sediment samples for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); (6) analyze sediment samples for acid volatile sulfide and simultaneously extracted metals; and (7) use benthic invertebrate surveys to help assess relocation areas.",
