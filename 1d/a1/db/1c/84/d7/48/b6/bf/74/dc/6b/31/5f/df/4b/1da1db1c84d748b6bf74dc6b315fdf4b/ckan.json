  "notes": "The continuation of the forage crop survey through the second summer added materially to the data collected, the areas surveyed, and the plant specimens and seed lots obtained. The extreme contrast in weather conditions during the two summer periods; cool and wet in 1956, warm and dry in 1957, presented an unusual opportunity to study the influence of weather conditions on disease development on indigenous forage plants as well as securing detailed notes on the behavior of grass and legume species under the contrasting environmental conditions. A resurvey of some of the more important areas in 1957 also resulted in securing more reliable data on plant and disease development during the contrasting seasons and obtaining plant specimens at an earlier stage of development, especially while in blossom, during the second year. This was important especially in the case of the legumes in which the floral structures are the major characters used in identification of species in the genera Astragalus, Oxytropis, and Vicia all abundantly represented in Alaska. Additional species not found during the first summer were collected in the resurvey of these important legume areas. The survey of the new sections -- notably the Yukon and Kuskokwim Valleys, the Wrangell Mountains, and the higher altitudes of the Alaska, Kuskokwim, Talkeetna, Chugach Mountains -- added materially to the information on the distribution of species and resulted in the collection of specimens and seed of a number of species and varieties not found in 1956. The data secured on plants and their diseases, on new species and varieties, on range management, and a suggested outline for a continuing research program are included in this report.",
