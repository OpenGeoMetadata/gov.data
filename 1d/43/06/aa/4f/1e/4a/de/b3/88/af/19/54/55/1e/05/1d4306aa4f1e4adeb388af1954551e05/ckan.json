  "notes": "The Topological Faces / Area Hydrography Relationship File (FACESAH.dbf) contains a record for each face / area hydrography feature relationship.  Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB.  A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face.  The face to which a record in the Topological Faces / Area Hydrography Relationship File (FACESAH.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to the Topological Faces Shapefile (FACES.shp) using the permanent topological face identifier (TFID) attribute.  The area hydrography feature to which a record in the Topological Faces / Area Hydrography Relationship File (FACESAH.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to the Area Hydrography Shapefile (AREAWATER.shp) using the area hydrography identifier (HYDROID) attribute.  A face may be part of multiple area water features.  An area water feature may consist of multiple faces.  \r\n",
