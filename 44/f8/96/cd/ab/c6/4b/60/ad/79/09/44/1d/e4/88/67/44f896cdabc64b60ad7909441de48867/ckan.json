    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tUltrathin, lightweight, flexible, and easily deployable solar cell (SC) capable of specific power greater than 1kW/kg are at an early stage of development for NASA&amp;#39;s future missions. &amp;nbsp;Quantum dots (QDs) and carbon nanostructures are employed in the design. &amp;nbsp;To date, initial, rudimentary optoelectric devices have been successfully fabricated. &amp;nbsp;Devices were first fabricated on rigid substrates for ease of manufacture. &amp;nbsp;These devices show enhanced photoconductivity, indicative of efficient photo-excitation and charge transfer between the QDs and polymer, which is crucial for the production of solar cells (SCs) from these materials. &amp;nbsp;Plots of the current versus voltage are used to characterize the operation of SCs. &amp;nbsp;The total film resistance decreases under illumination because photo-excited carriers are efficiently separated at the interfaces between the polymer and QDs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;Device fabrication was then executed on flexible substrates. &amp;nbsp;The optical absorptions of quantum dot/polymer blends were observed under ultraviolet illumination and the photocurrent responses were observed to be similar to that of the devices fabricated on the rigid substrates.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tNext steps include investigation of other conductive polymer systems. &amp;nbsp;Optimization of blends containing ligand-stripped QDs&amp;nbsp;will be sought. &amp;nbsp;Uniform dispersion of the QDs into the conductive polymer is necessary. &amp;nbsp;The optimal QD/conductive polymer system will be selected and design of the appropriate novel architecture will commence. &amp;nbsp;The first approach will be the fabrication of multi-junction layers, followed by the design of patterned structures. &amp;nbsp;Architectures will be designed in order to optimize photoabsorption, improve charge separation, and increase charge extraction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
