  "notes": "Knowledge of the existing geographic distribution of ownership, land covers, and other broad-scale features provides a basis for the prioritization of conservation and restoration actions in any strategic approach to conservation. Such understanding of geographic patterns can, for instance, help to identify conservation partners and where scale-appropriate land management actions should occur. For instance, in areas with large, contiguous public land ownerships, land managers may be more able to manage coarse-filter ecological processes such as prescribed or managed wildfire to meet ecosystem based goals and objectives. We enhanced prior broad-scale assessments of the National Wildlife Refuge System by providing all refuges in the Great Lakes Biological Network (Network) a higher resolution, ecoregional context for refuge-specific planning and management. We used multiple spatial data sources in a geographic information system (GIS) to depict patterns associated with 14 Network refuges and their 15 broader-scaled ecoregions. Spatial data pertaining to ownership, land cover, and soils were used to assess conditions among ecoregions of the Network and individual refuges. We also conducted analyses of landscape metrics using land cover data at both of these scales. Although more consideration of the observed patterns is warranted and some discrepancies in the data sources were found, preliminary findings indicate that considerable variability exists among ecoregions and refuges in all characteristics studied, although finer-scaled groupings are possible with some refuges (e.g., Shiawassee and Ottawa NWRs; Tamarac-Rice Lake-Necedah-Seney NWRs, etc.). Larger refuges tended to be in ecoregions with more public lands characterized by more natural land covers. In these refuges, we suggest the broad-scale conservation or restoration of natural patterns and processes is possible, with other public agencies comprising the dominant conservation partners. In other refuges in other ecoregions, attempts can be made to mitigate the adverse impacts of non-native land covers on primarily private lands that dominate these ecoregions. Conservation partners of note may be conservancies and other conservation-oriented private entities. The patterns we found indicate that each refuge must be viewed as having its own opportunities and limitations for wildlife habitat conservation and restoration.",
