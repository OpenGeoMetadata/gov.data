    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides hot pixel data, as an indicator of fires, that were detected by various satellites in the tri-national MAP region (Madre de Dios-Peru, Acre-Brazil, and Pando-Bolivia) in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Data from the following satellites/sensors were compiled: NOAA-12, NOAA-14, NOAA-15, and NOAA-16, which transports the AVHRR sensor; GOES-8 and GOES- 12, which transports the GOES Imager; and AQUA and TERRA, both which transport the MODIS sensor. These data were made available by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC) of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) via the internet (http://sigma.cptec.inpe.br/queimadas/). This data set contains 12 comma-delimited ASCII data files.Hot pixel data from satellites can be used as an indicator of fires and for the understanding of fire frequency in remote areas. The publication by Vasconcelos and Brown, 2007, which has been included as a companion file, describes the application of these data in the MAP region. In addition to the the hot pixel data, each observation has a derived vegetation type, susceptibility to fire, recent and past precipitation amounts, and a calculated fire risk value. These data are described in the Fire Risk Factor companion file, by Alberto W. Setzer and Raffi A. Sismanoglu, Version 5, February 2006. ",
