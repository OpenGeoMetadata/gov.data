    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Communications security (COMSEC) is essential to satellite communications.  Its role continues to grow as the available bandwidth expands to meet the ever increasing strategic and tactical data requirements of the 21st century. NASA's exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which assets can communicate seamlessly and securely to coordinate exploration as well as communicate back to Earth. \r\n\r\nThe flexibility and pervasiveness of the internet, including the transition to IPV6, is already being extended to military space assets ? e.g. the global grid. NASAs adoption of these same standards appears likely. The specific problem addressed by the Aeronix Phase I SBIR is to identify and develop modifications to our existing High Assurance Advanced Security Module (ASM) solution that satisfy the NASA networking requirements. \r\n\r\nThe innovation of the proposed solution is the development of an unclassified IP based network encryptor that is compatible with commercially available ground based HAIPE equipment operating with Suite B algorithms and the ability to operate in the presence of failures caused by the harsh environment of space.",
