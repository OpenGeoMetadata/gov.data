    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "L&amp;#61655;Garde will develop a lightweight Ultra-Flexible Advanced Stiffness Truss (Ultra-FAST) that will prove to have greater material metrics and structural performance indices than the current state of the art for large space deployable trusses. The key to the success of the proposed technology has to do with the new design approach and new material development. First, customized components will be fabricated such as thin-walled longerons and short flexure hinges in Phase I. The proposed flexure hinges have higher effective compressive strain values in bending than traditional compressive materials. These two key components have low density values not greater than 1,800 kg/m3 and are made of high performance carbon fibers. The estimated total truss mass per length is approximately 0.167 kg/m. L/d=100 slenderness longerons made of thin-walled tubes will guarantee a high axial and bending stiffness truss because they have a higher area moment of inertia compared with traditional solid rods. An axial load will be applied in order to measure the axial stiffness and axial strength of the truss. Also, bending moment will be applied to measure the bending stiffness and bending strength.",
