  "notes": "A former small arms firing range was located adjacent to Youngs Road in an upland portion of the Baring Division of Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge, Washington County, Maine. A site assessment of the range floor, berm, and nearby areas was conducted in late 2005. Soil samples from the range berm indicated highly elevated levels of lead (Pb). The maximum Pb concentration detected in soil from the range berm was 12,400 parts-per-million (ppm) on a dry weight basis, a concentration nearly 250 times higher than the normal background Pb level in Maine. Soil samples analyzed for Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedures (TCLP) from the berm also exceeded the regulatory criterion and indicated that the Pb-contaminated soil had to be classified as hazardous waste. Only low, near background levels of Pb were detected from the range floor and at the firing line. Surface water and sediment samples collected from a brook about 100 yards from the range did not contain elevated levels of lead. A two-phase soil cleanup of the range berm was conducted in 2008. Approximately 100 tons of Pb-contaminated soil were excavated and disposed off-site at a licensed hazardous waste facility in New York. Following excavations, two rounds of confirmatory soil and TCLP samples were submitted for laboratory analyses. The average Pb levels in all final soil and TCLP samples were 52 ppm (range: 9.9 – 164 ppm) and 2.2 ppm (range: 0.40 – 3.98 ppm), respectively. These levels are below the State of Maine remedial action guidelines of 375 ppm for Pb in soils and 5.0 ppm for Pb in TCLP solution.",
