    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advanced, robust, autonomous planning systems have not focused on the\nscheduling decisions made by the planner.  And high quality, optimizing\nschedulers have rarely been integrated with such planning systems and\nonly at a very coarse level.  Little research regarding interleaving\nscheduling and planning has been done.  Meanwhile, we have studied and\nimplemented human scheduling decision processes over a 20 yr. period,\ndeveloping the Aurora scheduling architecture in the process, which\nexecutes very rapidly and has solved scheduling problems in dozens of\ndiverse critical domains.  We propose to intimately integrate high\nspeed, high quality scheduling algorithms from Aurora with NASA's\nexisting EUROPA 2 architecture and expose high level descriptions of\nindividual scheduling decision methods to end-users, enabling users to\ncompose and configure these scheduling methods.  A combined\nEUROPA-Aurora system would allow for more efficient plans and more\noptimal scheduling.  It would allow EUROPA to better handle scheduling\nproblems in its current domains and be better applied to domains with\nmore significant scheduling issues.  Better schedules will get more\nscience done with the same time and resources.   In Phase I, we will\ndetermine the requirements of the integrated EUROPA-Aurora system for\nthe types of domains that would most benefit from the integration and\nwill determine additional heuristics, algorithms, methods and techniques\nneeded for Aurora for those domains.  We will develop the Integration\nDesign, including determining, with NASA's input, whether it is most\nbeneficial to integrate Aurora with EUROPA directly or to port\nalgorithms from Aurora to EUROPA.  We will prove feasibility of the\nintegration by implementing an integration prototype and applying it to\ntwo different domains to show its efficacy, generality, and\nadaptability.  Two options that we are already familiar with are\nplanning/scheduling for ISS operations and autonomous spacecraft/robots.",
