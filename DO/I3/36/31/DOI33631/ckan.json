  "notes": "The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) surveyed Folsom Lake in the fall of 2005 via an interagency agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers). The extensive surveys developed topographic imagery to study Folsom Dam, the wing and auxiliary dams, and the eight dikes that form Folsom Lake. The underwater survey was conducted from September 9 through 22, 2005 between lake elevations 437 and 441 feet (project datum). The underwater survey used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a global positioning system (GPS) that gave continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portions of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel. The above-water topography was developed by aerial photography under contract with Reclamation. The main body of the reservoir was flown on October 20, 2005 near reservoir elevation 430.2 (NAVD88-05) and high accuracy data was flown on 10/31/2005 near reservoir elevation 427.1 (NAVD88-05). The 2005 topographic maps were developed from the combined data sets. All digital topographic images for these studies were tied to vertical datum NAVD88-05. For purpose of computing updated area and capacity tables, the topographic elevations were shifted 2.34 feet to match the project vertical elevations. The bathymetric survey measured a minimum elevation of 190. Lake contour surface areas were developed from elevation 490.0 and below.\nAs of September 2005, at water surface elevation 466.0, the surface area was 11,140 acres with a total capacity of 966,823 acre-feet. Since initial closure in 1955, about 43,407 acre-feet of volume loss was measured by the 2005 survey.",
