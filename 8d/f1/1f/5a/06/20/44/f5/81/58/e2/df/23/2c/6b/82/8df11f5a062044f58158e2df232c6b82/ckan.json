  "notes": "This feature class contains internal wave packets extracted from SAR imagery that were binned in 1x1 minute latitude/longitude polygon grid cells. Statistics were calculated for each polygon grid cell---in particular, internal wave packet frequency, total internal wave packet area, average internal wave packet area, minimum internal wave packet area, maximum internal wave packet area, the variance of internal wave packet areas and the standard deviation of internal wave packet areas. These statistics were calculated so as to better understand the frequency, size and location of internal wave packets in Massachusetts Bay.",
