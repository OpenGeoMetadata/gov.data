See also the MGT (Management Area Polygons) data layer, part of the larger Northwest Arctic, Alaska ESI database for additional human-use information.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Northwest Arctic, Alaska. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
