  "notes": "This dataset was developed by Chris Stermer (CDFG - RAP Program). No original metadata were located, but the following is an abstract from a document describing the product: We conducted field surveys for Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii brewsterii) in 1997 and 1998, from June 15 through July 31, within the McCloud Flats region of Siskiyou County, California. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to predict potentially suitable habitat to survey prior to field visits. We used a GIS to model willow flycatcher habitat within our study area from remotely sensed data and digitally mapped data layers. Spatially explicit data used in our predictions included a vegetation map (a vegetation classification derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery), a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), a slope gradient model, and a stream layer. Seventy-seven Willow Flycatcher territories were found during our surveys. Nine of the territories were located within a large montane meadow complex (Bigelow Meadows) known to have Willow Flycatchers, the remaining territories (68) were predicted using a GIS pattern analysis. We characterized vegetation within .07 ha circular plots centered This dataset was modified on May 17, 2005 by Eric Haney of CDFG - Information Services branch. Modifications included addition of a Site_ID Field, and fields representing UTM Northing and Easting coordinates (using NAD83 Datum). These fields were added to assist in an effort to field validate the dataset. Note that not all UTM coordinates are located within habitat polygons. Depending on the irregular shape of the polygons, some of the utm coordinates are located outside the boundaries. These coordinates are only to be used for coarse navigational purposes. While there is no publication date planned, Region 1 staff are working to validate the model results.
