    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;Several methods for the production of graphene have been developed in recent years. The most promising techniques for the production of high-quality bulk graphene-based devices begin with graphite oxide (GO). Several methods to reduce GO have been developed, including chemical, thermal, and flash reduction. Not all of these methods produce high quality graphene and the ones that do, use relatively expensive equipment. A new and inexpensive solid state method developed by this proposal&amp;rsquo;s co-investigator at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;University of California Los Angeles (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;UCLA) produces high quality graphene films with a surface area of 1500 m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;/g, which is much larger than that reported for thermally or chemically converted graphene. Oxygen reduction with this method reaches much higher values than the more widely used chemical reduction method. These graphene sheets are mechanically strong, have high electrical conductivity, and can be used directly as electrodes in energy storage devices. This form of graphene is potentially useful for ultracapacitors with remarkable energy and power densities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new experimental setup for the reduction of GO based on the University of California Los Angeles laser-scribed graphene (LSG) method was designed at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory. This new method uses a diode pumped laser system with tunable power and short wavelengths. After a few months of optimization, the method successfully produced high quality graphene electrodes. This process results in graphene with a reduction level that is superior to traditional methods for the reduction of GO. This low oxygen content is required for building durable supercapacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (&lt;strong&gt;XPS&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;nbsp;analyses of the graphene sheets that we have produced show that the carbon content of the films ranges from 96&#37; to 98.5&#37; while the oxygen content is in the range of 1.4&#37; to 3&#37;. By comparison, more widely used chemical reduction methods reduce oxygen content to 10&#37; or higher. The carbon and oxygen content of the unreduced graphene oxide ranges between 66&#37; to 70&#37; and 29&#37; to 32&#37; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphene electrode sheets were made into solid squares for parallel-plate laser-scribed electrochemical capacitors (LSG-EC). LSG-ECs were driven through multiple charge/discharge cycles at the UCLA laboratory. The devices lose only about 3&#37; of its capacitance after 10,000 cycles. The shelf life of these devices was also measured.&amp;nbsp;The capacitancs of these devices&amp;nbsp;is retained after 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;",
