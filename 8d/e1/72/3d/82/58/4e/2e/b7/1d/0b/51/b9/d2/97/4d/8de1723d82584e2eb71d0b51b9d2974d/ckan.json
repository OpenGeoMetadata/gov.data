    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposal addresses NASA SBIR topic S1.07 In Situ Sensors for Lunar and Planetary Science, particularly the need for measuring isotopic ratios of the key elements associated with the signs of life (H, C, N, O). We propose a non-contact optical instrument similar to ChemCam that will be capable of measuring not only complete elemental compositions but also isotopic abundances of the key elements in surface materials. We intend to utilize and further develop our recently published technology: Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS). Our concept is simple, scientifically proven and already endorsed by two innovation awards we received. In Phase I, we concentrate on demonstrating the resolution and sensitivity required to determine these isotopes in synthetic samples and natural minerals relevant to Mars. The immediate focus is on Mars but our concept is also highly germane to future landing missions to the Moon, other planets and their moons, asteroids, and to a broad range of applications in ecology, agronomy, nuclear industry, radio-chemotherapy, forensics, security and other fields. We will advance the development to TRL4 by the end of Phase II with the further aim of integrating our LAMIS detector with a ChemCam-like instrument. The proposed instrument leverages and advances the technology developed for ChemCam. The added strength of measuring isotopes will greatly expand the capabilities of the ChemCam, which is now the most frequently used instrument onboard \"Curiosity.\" In Phase II, we will develop a breadboard prototype of the instrument that can be amended to measure other key isotopes (B, Cl, Mg, Ca, Sr, etc.). We plan further infusion in NASA missions and commercialization in Phases II-Ex and III. Our instrument can be used for stand-alone landing missions or for in situ sample characterization prior to sample return.",
