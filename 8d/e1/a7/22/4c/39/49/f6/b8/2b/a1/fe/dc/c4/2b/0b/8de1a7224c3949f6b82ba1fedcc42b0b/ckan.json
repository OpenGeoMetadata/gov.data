    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites &amp;ndash; VERTIGO (SPHERES-VERTIGO)&amp;nbsp;developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)&amp;mdash;are free-floating, soccer-ball-sized robots with their own propulsion and power. They are used aboard the ISS to study formation flight and other control system algorithms.&amp;nbsp;For this experiment, these same SPHERES will be programmed with thruster firings that will emulate common maneuvers carried out by launch vehicles and spacecraft. This motion will impart energy to the fluid inside the experiment, which will measure its effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISS provides the perfect environment to conduct liquid behavior studies in microgravity. This investigation is planned to collect valuable data on how liquids move around inside of a container when external forces are applied to that container &amp;ndash; this simulates how rocket fuels move around inside their tanks when motor thrusts are used to push the rocket through space.&amp;nbsp;The slosh experiment takes advantage of hardware already on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary slosh experiment component is a clear, pill-shaped Lexan tank in the middle of the assembly. This tank is shrouded by a tan box designed to prevent the ISS ambient lights from interfering with the cameras. Also in the middle, is the center hub made of aluminum. This center hub has two arms to hold two high-resolution cameras. These cameras will collect&amp;nbsp;video of the fluid inside the tank. The center hub assembly is connected to a larger frame, which connects to the two SPHERES units through a clamp system. VERTIGO computers attached to the SPHERES units will collect the data from the cameras and the onboard inertial measurement units.&amp;nbsp;These computers are already on the ISS and will be used by the slosh experiment as storage and power for the cameras and accelerometers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
