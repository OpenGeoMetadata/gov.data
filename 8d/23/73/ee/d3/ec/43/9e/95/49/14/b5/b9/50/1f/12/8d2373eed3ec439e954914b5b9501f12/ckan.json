  "notes": "MSDIS staff provided project management and worked with the Mid-MO RPC to locate \"structures\" within their region. MSDIS staff identified and located all “binary” structures and compiled them into a spatial database. That data was then given to Mid-MO RPC for review, with the option of validating and attributing the data. Annual review and maintenance of the database will occur with the assistance of local government and emergency management partners. An annually updated version of this database will be provided to MSDIS for dissemination to other state and federal agencies. Boone county was revised after review. For the second iteration of Boone county, GRC staff used a combination of Boone County situs points, City of Columbia situs points, and MSDIS 2011 Boone Structure Points as a base layer in the project. This layer was made by merging all situs points within 25 feet of a MSDIS 2011 Boone Structure Point into one point. This data layer was named GRC_BOCO_Merged. GRC staff then edited this layer by identifying structures using Bing imagery overlay in ArcMap 10 and MSDIS 2008 2-foot imagery.",
