    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "One of the key problems that arises in many areas is to estimate a potentially nonlinear function [tex] G(x, \\theta)[/tex] given input and output samples [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex] so that [tex]y approx G(x, \\theta)[/tex].\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many approaches to addressing this regression problem. Neural networks, regression trees, and many other methods have been developed to estimate [tex]$G$[/tex] given the input output pair [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex].\r\n\r\nOne method that I have worked with is called Gaussian process regression. There many good texts and papers on the subject. For more technical information on the method and its applications see: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/\r\n\r\nA key problem that arises in developing these models on very large data sets is that it ends up requiring an [tex]O(N^3)[/tex] computation where N is the number of data points and the training sample. Obviously this becomes very problematic when N is large.\r\n\r\nI discussed this problem with Leslie Foster, a mathematics professor at San Jose State University.  He, along with some of his students, developed a method  to address this problem based on Cholesky decomposition and pivoting.   He also shows that this leads to a numerically stable result.  If ou're interested in some light reading, Iâ€™d suggest you take a look at his [recent paper](    ) (which was accepted in the Journal of Machine Learning Research) posted on dashlink. We've also posted code for you to try it out. Let us know how it goes.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in applications of this method in the area of prognostics, check out our [new paper](/dashlink/resources/51/) on the subject which was published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.",
