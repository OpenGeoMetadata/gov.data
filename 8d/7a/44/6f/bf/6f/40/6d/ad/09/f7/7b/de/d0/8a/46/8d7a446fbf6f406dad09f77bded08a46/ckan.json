  "notes": "TIGERweb allows the viewing of TIGER spatial data online and for TIGER data to be streamed to your mapping application. The web-based application allows the users to visualize our TIGER(Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database) data. The application allows users to select features and view their attributes, to search for features by name or geocode, and to identify features by selecting them from a map. The TIGERweb application is a simple way to view our TIGER data without having to download the data. The web Mapping serivices provide a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from our geospatial database. It allows users to produce maps containg TIGERweb layers with layers from other servers.It consists of the following two applications and six services: Applications: TIGERweb TIGERweb2010 Services: Current Geography ACS 2012 ACS 2011 Census 2010 (for the TIGERweb application) Physical Features Census 2010 for the TIGERweb2010 application)",
