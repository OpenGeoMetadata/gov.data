    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is an essential treatment for several life-threatening conditions including pneumonia, the single biggest cause of death in children less than five years of age.&amp;nbsp; Developing countries frequently lack access to the bottled, cryogenically formed oxygen used in Houston hospitals.&amp;nbsp; Oxygen generators that use Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) methods are prone to system failure: one study reports that 20 out of 20 PSA units donated to a hospital in Gambia were inoperable after 6 weeks of use.&amp;nbsp; There is a new oxygen concentrator technology that uses electrolytic oxygen transfer through a strong, ceramic, monolithic wafer.&amp;nbsp; The system is capable of producing high purity (&amp;gt;99.9&#37;) pressurized (200 psig) oxygen without a mechanical compressor.&amp;nbsp; Because it is a solid state device, it shows good promise for reliable performance in demanding conditions.&amp;nbsp; One unit has operated in a military field hospital in Afghanistan - powered by a diesel generator, it has operated 24/7 for 14 months with no shut-downs or failures.&amp;nbsp; The technology is new: there are fewer than 12 ceramic oxygen concentrator units with this design in existence.&amp;nbsp; NASA has three units.&amp;nbsp; No ceramic oxygen concentrator (with the monolithic wafer design) has ever been powered by a solar power source.&amp;nbsp; A ceramic oxygen concentrator, powered by a solar panel, has the possibility of safely and reliabily delivering high purity, high pressure oxygen in demanding environments (like hospitals in developing countries or space exploration vehicles) - to date, nobody has developed or tested a ceramic oxygen concentrator that is powered by solar panels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
