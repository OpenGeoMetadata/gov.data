  "notes": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles\n          and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic\n          information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated\n          Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a\n          seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line\n          shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined\n          to cover the entire nation. State Legislative Districts (SLDs) are the areas from which\n          members are elected to State legislatures. The SLDs embody the upper (senate) and lower\n          (house) chambers of the State legislature. Nebraska has a unicameral legislature and the\n          District of Columbia has a single council, both of which the Census Bureau treats as\n          upper-chamber legislative areas for the purpose of data presentation; there are no data by\n          SLDL for either Nebraska or the District of Columbia. A unique three-character census\n          code, identified by State participants, is assigned to each SLD within a State. In\n          Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, and\n          Puerto Rico, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the SLDs to\n          cover all of the State or State equivalent area. In these areas with no SLDs defined, the\n          code \"ZZZ\" has been assigned, which is treated as a single SLD for purposes of data\n          presentation. The boundaries of the 2012 State legislative districts were provided by\n          State-level participants through the RDP and reflect the districts used to elect members\n          in or prior to the November 2012 election.",
