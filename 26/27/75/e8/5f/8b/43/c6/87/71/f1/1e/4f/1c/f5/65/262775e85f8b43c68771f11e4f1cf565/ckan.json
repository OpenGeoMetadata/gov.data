  "notes": "We established two longterm ecological monitoring sites in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1996 and three more will be established between 1997 and 1999. The sites were chosen to be representative of each of the five major ecosystems of the refuge, the saltmarshinshore waters area, coastal plain tundra, alpine tundra, foresttundra ecotone, and boreal forest. These sites will be just one part of the refuges overall inventory and monitoring plan, but will serve as focal points to concentrate the monitoring of some basic ecosystem components such as birds, invertebrates, small mammals, vegetation, and soils.There are surprisingly few longterm ecological data sets in existence. After reviewing 749 papers published in the journal Ecology, Tilman 1989 reported that less than 2 of the studies lasted at least five field seasons. The current intense interest in longterm dynamics of ecosystems, especially in relation to human disturbance and global warming, has highlighted the unfortunate scarcity of baseline data in almost all fields. An example is the scarcity of baseline data from the Prudhoe Bay area before oil development, which has made it difficult to assess the effects of the development there. Land management agencies probably have a longerterm connection to the land they manage than do universities or other entities. An important contribution we can make to the understanding and conservation of ecosystems is to establish monitoring programs and commit ourselves to the discipline of maintaining the programs for many years. We can improve and add to the programs as our understanding or funding increases, but the important thing is to make a start.The FWS has a stated goal to reach a standardized, longterm approach to monitoring the environmental health of refuge ecosystems. In the past, much emphasis has been placed on monitoring the larger vertebrates whose home ranges cover extensive areas. Habitats, vegetation communities and species with small home ranges or species closer to the bottom of the food chain have been largely ignored in this large species emphasis. Longterm monitoring of permanent study sites will allow inventory and monitoring of these ecological components over time.Monitoring of flora, fauna, and environmental variables will be concentrated at five ecological monitoring sites over the years. The objectives are to:1 Obtain baseline data on ecosystem components such as vegetation, soils, small mammals, birds, and invertebrates.2 Accumulate a longterm spatial and temporal data base to allow elucidation of the relationships between these components.3 Detect natural and humancaused changes by repeated monitoring of permanent plots through the years.Monitoring programs at the sites will be established as needed, depending on management concerns and available funding. Some of the first ones we propose to set up are:1. Permanent vegetation plots2. Annual breeding bird survey3. Invertebrate and small mammal trappingMethods will be consistent with those used for other monitoring programs in Alaska. Not all components are monitored each year. For example, vegetation data could be collected only every five years but the bird survey needs to be done every year.",
