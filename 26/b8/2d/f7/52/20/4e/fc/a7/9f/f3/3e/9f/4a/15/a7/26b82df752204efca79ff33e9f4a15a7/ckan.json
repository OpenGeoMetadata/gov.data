  "notes": " The primary\n               legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are\n               known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the\n               organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area,\n               census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the\n               State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada,\n               and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any\n               county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These\n               incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent\n               entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no\n               primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of\n               data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of\n               counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and\n               Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana\n               Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United\n               States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent\n               entities. The Economic Census county shapefile is similar to the current shapefile\n               except that the boundaries are as of January 1, 2012, in order to match the vintage\n               of the 2012 Economic Census. The one exception is Guam, where the county subdivisions\n               substitute as county equivalent entities for the Economic Census.\n            ",
