    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Air transportation, one of the most important modes of transportation, is also one of the safest. Nevertheless, the public demands that safety levels continuously improve and that the absolute number of aviation accidents continue to decline, even as air-traffic levels increase.  On February 12, 1997, after the tragedy of TWA 800, President William J. Clinton declared,\r\n“We will achieve a national goal of reducing the fatal aircraft accident rate by 80% within 10 years.”\r\n \r\nIn response to this presidential declaration, the administrator of NASA announced that NASA would undertake a new program in aviation safety in support of this objective. NASA quickly formed the Aviation Safety Investment Strategy Team (ASIST) in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which organized a series of five workshops to examine the options and recommend an approach for NASA to develop the enabling technologies that address the president's goal. The exceptional and dedicated participation from all sectors of the aviation industry in the development of NASA’s strategy was remarkable.",
