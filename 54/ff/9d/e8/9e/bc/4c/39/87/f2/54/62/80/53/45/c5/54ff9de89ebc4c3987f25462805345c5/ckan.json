    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Developing a next generation high performance solar array with\nsignificant reduction in size and weight will result in improved NASA\nmission capabilities at lower cost.  Photovoltaic cell technology is\nevolving rapidly to the point solar array structural and mechanical\nsystems do not fully optimize system level mass and volume performance\npotential.  MMA Design LLC (MMA) proposes to develop a compact\ndeployable modular solar array concept with next generation cost and\nperformance improvements.  A solar array is proposed that is\nmechanically simple while meeting the support requirements of currently\navailable solar cells, as well as future higher performance cells.  The\nsolar array decreases production and system costs through modularity and\nsimplicity, increases the power to stowed volume ratio (W/m3), and\nincreases specific power (W/kg), thus exceeding the performance of the\nexisting state-of-the-art (SOA) systems. MMA proposes to advance the SOA\nin photovoltaic power systems by developing a Fan Deployed Modular High\nWatts per Kilogram (FDM-HaWK) advanced solar array consisting of an\ninnovative fan deployed structure.  On-going research at MMA in\ninnovative and manufacturable solar array components, mechanisms and\ndeployable structures makes the proposed solar array feasible and lower\nrisk.  The proposed FDM-HaWK uses many identical modular solar array\npanels in two-string configurations to reduce cell stringing and laydown\ncosts.  The significance to NASA of our innovative solution is the\nreduction of solar array costs while producing over 300 watts per\nkilogram (W/kg) with 32&amp;#37; efficient next generation solar cells in a 5.6\nkW solar array wing.  Based on current projections for next generation\ncell performance by Spectrolab, the proposed system will be capable of\nproducing over 350 W/kg by the year 2017.  From the perspective of\npackaging efficiency, the FDM-HaWK will produce 51 kW/m3 with existing\nqualified triple junction cells and 63 kW/m3 by the year 2017.",
