Vector points in this data set represent Steller sea lion haul-outs and polar bear dens. Species-specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source information are stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer. See also the M_MAMMAL (Marine Mammal Polygons) data layer, part of the larger Northwest Arctic, Alaska ESI database, for additional marine mammal information.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Northwest Arctic, Alaska. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
