    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Phase I objective is to develop a preliminary design and manufacturing plan for carbon fiber composite reflectors and/or a carbon fiber telescope that are traceable to the requirements of current and future CMB missions.  The Phase II objectives are to complete the design and manufacturing planning, fabricate necessary tooling, manufacture hardware components that include two reflector support structures, integrate and align the reflectors and confirm telescope optical performance via analysis of as-built mechanical alignment and surface accuracy data.  To prepare for and conduct the PDR within six months, the proposed Phase I tasks will include:  1) Develop telescope requirements in conjunction with CMB researchers and/or NASA with the goal of resolving sufficient detail to evaluate CFRP technology for CMB missions, 2) Compare the requirements to CFRP heritage, as-built results, and experience, 3) Develop a concept based upon high (currently 4-9) TRL CFRP component technologies, 4) Predict the performance of the concept, 5) Develop a pricing model to predict recurring cost, 6) Define a preliminary manufacturing plan that includes predicted versus budgeted errors, 7) Develop a summary technical/cost compliance matrix that summarizes all technical and cost predictions versus requirements, 8) Summarize all engineering, manufacturing, and cost information in preparation for PDR including the envisioned path to telescope TRL6 during Phase II, and 9) Conduct a PDR with support from mechanical, optical, structural, thermal, materials, and manufacturing engineers.",
