  "notes": "Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB. A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face.  The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face.  Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value.  Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2010 Census and the annual estimates and surveys.  The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.  \r\n",
