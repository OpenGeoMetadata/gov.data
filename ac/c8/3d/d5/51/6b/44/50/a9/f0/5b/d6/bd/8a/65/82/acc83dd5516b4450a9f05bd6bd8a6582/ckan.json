    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

Use ground based observations to observe winds and conductivities in the ionosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe Auroral Spatial Structures Probe (ASSP) is a NASA sounding rocket mission that, will be used to &lt;a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFMSA31A1959S\" id=\"_GPLITA_0\" in_rurl=\"http://i.trkjmp.com/click?v=VVM6MzYxMzI6MjE1NTpzdHVkeTo2M2Y3MDQyYTE2ZTU0YTE5N2Q3OTVmNjk3ZWVhNmQwMjp6LTEwNDEtMTA3NTUzOmFkc2Ficy5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdTozOTQ1NjpmYTVkMTdiYzQzNjMxMGQxNjJlYTMxYmFmYzZhN2MzMQ\" title=\"Click to Continue &amp;gt; by Text-Enhance\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; both the spatial and temporal small scale variation of the E-fields during breakup aurora and geomagnetically active conditions. This will be accomplished through the use of a constellation of small payloads that separate relative to each other throughout a sounding rocket flight. The multiple baseline observations of the electric and magnetic fields will be used to observe variability of both the E-field and the Poynting flux. These observations will be placed in the context of available data, including winds, large scale E-fields, and proxy conductivity (airglow images) observations. In this way we will address the main scientific objective of this mission which is: What are the contributions of small spatial scale and rapid temporal scale fluctuations of electric fields relative to the larger-scale electrodynamic processes? The high altitude rocket will be launched along the magnetic field line and carry six sub-payloads to be ejected from the main payload at high velocity. The sub-payloads will be deployed both along the flight path and perpendicular to the flight path so that both spatial features and temporal-spatial ambiguities can be explored. The low-mass sub-payloads that, for a fixed ejection impulse will achieve at least a 50 km separation by the end of the flight are key to the observational success. Each sub-payload will carry a crossed pair of double-probe sensors to measure in-situ electric fields, a three axis magnetometer, a Langmuir probe and a GPS receiver. In this poster we review the ASSP science and mission concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
