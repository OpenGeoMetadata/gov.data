    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Robonaut 2 (R2) Technology Project Element within Human Robotic Systems (HRS) is to developed advanced technologies for infusion into the Robonaut 2 project leading to new capabilities for Robonaut. In FY14, HRS and the Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) Human Exploration Telerobotics (HET) will collaborate to deliver a mobile IVA Robonaut 2 to ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 2014, the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Robonaut 2 Technologies&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; project element will develop two technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile IVA Robonaut 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natural User Interfaces for Advanced Telerobotic Operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary work area in this project element is to contribute to sending a mobile IVA Robonaut to the International Space Station (ISS) and to begin using it as a mobile system.&amp;nbsp; The main area where HRS will contribute to Robonaut 2 in FY14 will be in the area of battery development.&amp;nbsp; HRS will perform component testing of the engineering development unit (EDU) and complete assembly of the certification unit battery. The development will eventually lead to a robotic system moving and working safely in the same space as Astronauts on ISS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second work area under this project element will be to use body-tracking input devices (i.e. Microsoft Xbox Kinect and accelerometer gloves) to immerse an operator in an accurate virtual model of the robot&amp;rsquo;s environment, capture the intent of the operator, and safely execute mobility and manipulation tasks suitable for platforms such as Robonaut 2. Initially, the operator&amp;rsquo;s head position will be tracked in order to render an appropriate point of view in the virtual environment. Next, model-based recognizers will be developed and trained to detect gestures by the human operator and trigger autonomous behaviors on the robotic system. Initial efforts will use the Kinect sensor, with additional potential investigations into other similar or complementary sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FY14, development will focus on further extending our natural user interface system to address the concurrent operation of manipulation and mobility aspects of hybrid robotic systems such as Robonaut 2 with legs (ground only in FY14) or an ATHLETE robot driving while manipulating a payload.&lt;/p&gt;",
