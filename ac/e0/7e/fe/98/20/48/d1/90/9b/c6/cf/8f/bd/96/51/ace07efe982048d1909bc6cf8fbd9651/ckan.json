  "notes": "A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map. The original USGS scanned image includes all map collar information and is georeferenced to the UTM zone and datum of the printed quad map. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has removed the collar information to allow seamless viewing of adjacent DRGs. Where needed, DNR has also projected the files to UTM Zone 15 (extended across Minnesota), NAD83. The DRG can be used to collect, review, and revise other digital data, especially digital line graphs (DLG). When the DRG is combined with other digital products, such as digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ) or digital elevation models (DEM), the resulting image provides additional visual information for the extraction and revision of base cartographic information.",
