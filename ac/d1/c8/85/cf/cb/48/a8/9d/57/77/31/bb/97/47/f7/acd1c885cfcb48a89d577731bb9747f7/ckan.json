    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The measurement of cloud water content is of great importance in understanding the formation of clouds, their structure, and their radiative properties which in turn affect the climate.  While a variety of sensors exist for making these measurements, all of the existing sensors require far too much power or other energy input to be used on small platforms with limited payloads such as UAVs, balloons, and kites.  Anasphere has, in Phase I work, clearly demonstrated the feasibility of an entirely new technique for the in-situ measurement of cloud water content.  The new sensor is lightweight (under 40 g), consumes very little power (the sensor can run for days on one 9-volt battery), and is very inexpensive.\r\n\r\nPhase II work will focus on refining the sensor design from both mechanical and electronic perspectives, completing extensive laboratory and field tests of the improved sensors, and delivering several examples to NASA.  Two sequential cycles of design improvement, laboratory testing, and flight testing are envisioned.  Samples of the sensors will be sent to NASA as part of each flight testing cycle.  \r\n\r\nThe Phase II effort will culminate in the availability of a simple and inexpensive cloud water content sensor for cloud research.  This sensor will be very useful to scientists studying cloud formation and structure.  It will enable such scientists to inexpensively obtain in-situ data that previously was obtained only through the use of an expensive research aircraft flying through the cloud.\r\n",
