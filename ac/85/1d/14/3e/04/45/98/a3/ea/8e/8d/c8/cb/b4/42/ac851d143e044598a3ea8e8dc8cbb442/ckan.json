    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optical communication links provide higher data transfer rates with lower mass, power, and volume than conventional radio-frequency links. For deep space applications at long operational ranges, high performance stabilization of the space terminal data link is required. To meet this need, CDI has developed a novel application of our free-floating isolation platform. Based upon a Shuttle-proven technology, this approach yields 6-DOF isolation from the disturbances of the host vehicle while providing high-bandwidth active stabilization to attenuate both payload disturbances as well as any residual disturbances transferred from the base across the power/data umbilical. The proposed approach is designed to achieve better than 0.5microradian-rms stabilization for all frequencies above 0.1Hz when operating on a spacecraft.\r\n\r\nPhase I developed the design concept, demonstrated robustness through sensitivity studies, demonstrated performance through simulation, and establish the feasibility of the approach to meet the space terminal isolation requirements. Component testing of the sensors and actuators further demonstrated that the design will meet the performance requirements. These tests and analyses advanced the technology to TRL-4.\r\n\r\nPhase II continues the development by ground testing an end-to-end prototype on a soft suspension testbed to demonstrate overall performance in a simulated low-g operational environment. Both acquisition search and beacon track will be demonstrated. Iterations of development and environment testing are performed to produce several space qualified 2-axis strut assemblies for delivery to NASA. Three strut assemblies rigidly mounted to any space terminal will provide 6-DOF isolation and high-bandwidth stabilization. These struts are designed for robustness so they can be used as an add-on to any rigid structure, thus enabling a broad range of space applications that require high-precision stabilization, isolation, and pointing.",
