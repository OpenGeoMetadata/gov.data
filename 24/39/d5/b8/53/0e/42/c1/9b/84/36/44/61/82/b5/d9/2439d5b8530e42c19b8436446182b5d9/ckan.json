  "notes": " FUNCTION: Supports development and evaluation of next-generation communication technologies for mobile and dynamic data networks. This includes wireless meshes, mobile systems, and other disruptive communication environments relevant to DoD operations. The Mobile and Dynamic Network (MadNet) facility provides simulation, real-time network emulation, and specialized network measurement tools and methods. The facility supports a variety of sponsor organizations by performing research into nextgeneration networking concepts, including emerging Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) technology and airborne networks. DESCRIPTION: The MadNet Laboratory includes computing assets capable of conducting large-scale simulations of data communication networks, typically concentrating on mobile, wireless scenarios. The facility also uses high performance computer systems to emulate dynamic, wireless networks in a controlled environment. Mobile networks of more than 70 nodes have been emulated and the system can scale to larger network sizes if needed. The laboratory has laptop computers, hand-held personal computing platforms, and embedded systems to support field testing and demonstration of mobile computing environments including vehicular, man-portable, and autonomous (e.g. sensor) systems. The laboratory also maintains the ability to rapidly prototype working advanced protocols and network communication applications. Laboratory prototypes are generally instrumented with sophisticated data collection and analysis capabilities. Example implementations include protocols for reliable data transport, real-time communication (including voice, video, and other), collaborative computing, dynamic routing, and network self-configuration and organization. INSTRUMENTATION: The laboratory enables quantitative measurement of protocol and network operation. Software capabilities include dynamic traffic generators capable of emulating characteristics of real network communication applications, and associated data analysis tools to examine different system performance aspects. The laboratory employs a variety of data visualization capabilities for real-time and post- monitoring of dynamic network operation in the test scenario environments. Special hardware instruments such as wireless protocol analyzers are also employed as needed.  ",
