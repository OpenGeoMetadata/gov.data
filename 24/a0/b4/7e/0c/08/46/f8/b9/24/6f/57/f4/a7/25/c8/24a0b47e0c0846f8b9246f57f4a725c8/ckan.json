  "notes": " Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and TEMPEST testing are conducted at EPG&amp;#39;s Blacktail Canyon Test Facility in one of its two large 120 dB anechoic chambers or one of its two 100 dB semi-anechoic shielded rooms. The test facility is located in a radio frequency (RF) isolated area ideal for open-field EMI and EMC testing and has a frequency authorization that allows for outside susceptibility and EMC testing from 10 kHz to 40 GHz.   With a door 14 ft. X 12 ft., the large anechoic chamber has a working volume measuring 35 ft. long x 14 ft. wide x 14 ft. high and is capable of accommodating large vehicles such as an M1 tank, armored personnel carriers, helicopters or multiple shelter, large platform systems. This chamber is equipped with necessary cooling and exhaust to allow for total operation of the test item while inside the chamber&amp;#39;s controlled environment.   The second large anechoic chamber, measuring 22 ft. long x 12 ft. wide x 10 ft., high has a door size of 14 ft. high by 12 ft. wide. It accommodates military equipment ranging from manpack portable equipment to vehicles such as HMMWV, LAV, M113, and full- and half-sheltered systems.   The facility&amp;#39;s two smaller chambers allow for testing of bench size items such as computer systems, GPS, tactical radios, chemical agent detectors, inverters, manportable items etc.  ",
