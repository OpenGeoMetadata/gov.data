    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\r\nThe physical world around us is three-dimensional (3D), yet most existing display systems with flat screens can handle only two-dimensional (2D) flat images that lack the third dimension (depth) information.  This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and visualizing the complexity of real world objects. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this Phase 1 SBIR is to develop a novel high-resolution volumetric 3D display system that has a static solid crystal screen. In contrast to conventional 3D visualization based on 2D flat screen, the \"volumetric 3D display\" we proposed herein possesses a true 3D display volume, has a 360 degree look-around group viewing capability, and allows a group of viewers to simultaneously view and analyze 3D data without wearing any special viewing goggle.  It provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to human visual system to perceive 3D objects and is considered as the Holy Grail solution to 3D visualization of many NASA datasets that inherently are extremely large, complicated, and multi-dimensional.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we successfully developed various volumetric 3D display systems in the past, most these previously developed systems generate their 3D display volume by a large size moving screen that rotates constantly at a speed of 600~1800 RPM. The structure of a moving screen dramatically complicates the design, production, use, and maintenance of the display system, making it very delicate and fragile for daily uses for NASA visualization work on earth.  Due to the existence of a large moving parts, such volumetric 3D display technology is certainly not suitable for on-board uses in space missions.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR program will investigate the feasibility of a technology breakthrough recently made by Xigen LLC and developed a revolutionary new concept of volumetric 3D display, which totally eliminates any moving screen. \r\n",
