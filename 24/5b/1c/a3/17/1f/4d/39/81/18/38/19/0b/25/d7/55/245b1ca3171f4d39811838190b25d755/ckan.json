  "notes": "Featherstone National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located in Virginia along the Potomac River, about 35.4 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Washington, D.C. The 66.3 hectare (164 acre) refuge was acquired in 1979 as a portion of the Mason Neck NWR complex. The overall objective of this investigation was to gather baseline information on the contaminant status of the area. These data are needed to identify possible sources of contaminants; assess risks to aquatic life and piscivorous wildlife; and, if necessary, develop source control strategies. Neabsco Creek, which borders the refuge, and Farm Creek, which bisects it, were the primary study sites. In 1991, sediments, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were sampled for organic and inorganic contaminants. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in channel catfish muscle tissues averaged 1.74 ppm in Farm Creek and 2.45 ppm in Neabsco Creek. Four of the six samples from Neabsco Creek and 2/6 samples from Farm Creek had PCB concentrations exceeding the 2 ppm FDA tolerance. Mean PCB concentrations in largemouth bass from Farm and Neabsco Creeks were 0.28 ppm and 0.12 ppm, respectively. Sediments did not contain detectable concentrations of PCBs. In view of these data and the propensity of these species to move in and out of the creeks, the concentrations are viewed as representative of regional rather than highly localized inputs. During the study, there were observations of external lesions in channel catfish and brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), which merited a follow-up study. In 1992, the prevalence of lesions in 2930 brown bullhead collected from each of these creeks and from Marumsco Creek (1.75 km upstream) was determined. Coincident with the fish sampling, concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments were measured since PAH-contaminated sediments have been associated with an increased prevalence of cancerous lesions in this species. The average concentration of total carcinogenic PAHs in sediments was: Farm Creek (0.34 ppm) < Marumsco Creek (0.63 ppm) < Neabsco Creek (1.37 ppm). The prevalence of lesions between the three creeks was compared with the ranking of average carcinogenic PAHs in sediments, using the Jongheere-Terpstra test. A significant test (p<0.05) indicated that the prevalence of a lesion increased in the same order as the mean levels of carcinogenic PAHs. The prevalence of skin neoplasms (squamous carcinomas and papillomas) was 3.4` in Farm Creek, 16.6% in Marumsco Creek, and 33.3% in Neabsco Creek. This ranking and the rankings of the total number of fish with tumors, invasive tumors, or non-parasitic lesions followed the trend in sediment carcinogenic PAHs according to the Jongheere-Terpstra test. The prevalence of liver carcinomas (0% at Farm Creek, 3.3% at Marumsco Creek, and 10% at Neabsco Creek) was of borderline significance (p=0.06). A possible source of PAHs in Neabsco Creek is a complex of three adjacent marinas, containing a fueling station and about 400 slips. The highest sediment concentrations of total PAHs (25.5 ppm) and total carcinogenic PAHs (2.70 ppm) were found in the station closest to the complex. The tumor prevalence and sediment concentration data were compared with data from studies in the Great Lakes region. It is recommended that further sampling take place in Neabsco creek to determine the extent of PAH contamination. Source controls should have the objective of reducing any continuing inputs.",
