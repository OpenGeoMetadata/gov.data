  "notes": "This data set consists of the administrative hydrographic area (HA) boundaries for Nevada at 1:750,000-scale and estimates of natural recharge, artificial recharge, pumpage, and net ground-water flow for each basin where the information is available. Formal hydrographic areas in Nevada were delineated systematically by the U.S. Geological Survey and Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Division of Water Resources (NDWR) in the late 1960's (Rush, 1968; Cardinalli and others, 1968) for scientific and administrative purposes. The official hydrographic area names, numbers, and geographic boundaries continue to be used in U.S. Geological Survey scientific reports and NDWR administrative activities. Although the boundary lines between hydrographic areas generally coincide with true topographic basin divides, some of the lines are arbitrary divisions that have no topographic control. The pumpage, recharge, and interbasin flow estimates were derived from a variety of sources and methods. The data were tabulated and published by Lopes and Evetts in 2004.
