    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Based on the successful feasibility demonstration in Phase I, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel Structural Integrity Inspection and Visualization System (SIRIUS), which addresses NASA's need for compact nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the structural integrity of spacecraft components and structures. SIRIUS is based on one-sided three-dimensional (3D) structure imaging via collecting the information on density profiles in multiple object cross sections through hard X-ray Compton-scattered imaging. The SIRIUS Phase I prototype system demonstrated excellent potential for 3D localization of defects in various aerospace materials and structures, such as thermal protection system (TPS) ceramic foam tiles, micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shielding, spacecraft pressure walls, inflatable habitat structures, composite overwrapped pressure vehicles (COPV), aluminum-rubber composites, and metal honeycomb materials. In Phase II, POC will develop a compact, standalone version of the SIRIUS system with improved performance (in terms of resolution and data acquisition speed), as well as an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for straightforward data acquisition and visualization. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a TRL-6 demonstration of SIRIUS at the NASA facilities. SIRIUS will provide NASA with an effective NDE tool for both in-space and on-ground applications.",
