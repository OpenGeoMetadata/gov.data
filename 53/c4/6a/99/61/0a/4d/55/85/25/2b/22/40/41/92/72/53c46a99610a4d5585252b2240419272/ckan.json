    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Dust mitigation is critical to the survivability of vehicle and infrastructure components and systems and to the safety of astronauts during EVAs and planetary surface operations. By coupling Eikos Invisicon&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; nanocomposite conductors with existing dust mitigation Dust Shield technology developed at NASA-KSC, the Phase I program demonstrated an enabling approach to producing electrodynamic dust mitigation devices on a wide variety of surfaces not possible with traditional metal based electrode materials. Eikos reproduced proven NASA spiral electrodes using Invisicon&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; patterned onto transparent plastics, Tyvek&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; fabric, and silicone rubber sheets; employing inkjet and spray deposition methods, two CNT ink formulations, and four dielectric binders to create working devices. These Invisicon&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt;-based devices are far more flexible then traditional devices and exhibit superior durability to abrasion, elongation, and thermal cycling.   A dust mitigation system utilizing this technology has broad value to many NASA mission directorates and terrestrial commercial applications. The Phase II project will build on these successes and integrate the electrode into larger surfaces, and more complex components. Further, extensive dust mitigation, and both environmental and mechanical testing, will be conducted to position this electrode technology for insertion into windows, fabrics, and elastomeric components in space and terrestrial applications.",
