EPA has defined \"time to time\" to mean April 1 of even numbered years. The failure to meet water quality standards might be due to an individual pollutant, multiple pollutants, \"pollution,\" or an unknown cause of impairment. The 303(d) listing process includes waters impaired by point sources and nonpoint sources of pollutants. States must also establish a priority ranking for the listed waters, taking into account the severity of pollution and uses. The EPA regulations that govern 303(d) listing can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 130.7. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources compiles this impaired water list, or 303(d) listing. The 303(d) listing is composed of those lakes, wetlands, streams, rivers, and portions of rivers that do not meet all state water quality standards. These are considered \"impaired waterbodies\" and states are required to calculate total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for pollutants causing impairments.",
