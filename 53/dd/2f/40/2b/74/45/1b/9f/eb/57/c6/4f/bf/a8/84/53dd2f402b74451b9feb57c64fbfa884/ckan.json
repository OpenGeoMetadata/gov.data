    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Silicon carbide matrix composites can produce turbomachinery structures with 1500&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C service temperature capability at less than one-half the weight of metallic structures.  This would translate into substantial improvement in rocket (or aircraft) system performance.  However, SiC composites do not have adequate long term stability under hot, humid turbine engine conditions.  Thus, reliable environmental barrier coating (EBC) technology needs to be developed for SiC composites for long duration or reusable turbomachinery applications.  \r\n\r\nThe preceding SBIR Phase I program proved feasibility of our technology to improve environmentally durability of silicon carbide CMCs.  The Phase II program will refine coating materials and processes. A comprehensive test matrix is included to assess repeatability in environmental barrier performance.  Next, this technology will be used to produce representative turbine engine test articles.  Surmet has teamed with a major prime contractor, so as to develop technology that is useful towards near-term NASA systems.  Key environmental barrier testing work will be conducted at specialized test facility that simulates turbine engine environment.  Thus, the Phase II program will provide a strong foundation for a follow-on Phase III program which will start implementation into specific NASA system(s).\r\n",
