  "notes": " FUNCTION: Contributes to the Navy program to develop a high-performance electromagnetic launcher for a future electric warship. This laboratory, together with NRL materials analysis laboratories, focuses on materials aspects of high-power railgun operation. This includes developing high-performance rails, insulators, and armatures that can withstand the megampere currents and thousands of atmospheres of pressure needed to launch projectiles at high velocities. The facility houses a medium-sized railgun, a capacitor bank driver, and multiple diagnostics to measure barrel performance. DESCRIPTION: The high bay laboratory contains a 6-m-long railgun firing into an evacuated transport tube and target chamber. The rails and insulators of the gun are located within a stainless steel containment capable of withstanding the extreme pressures generated during launch. A target chamber is contained within a concrete block house with 18-inch-thick walls on all sides. The gun is powered by 22 half-megajoule capacitor banks, each of which is discharged using high-current solid-state switches. The banks can drive peak currents of up to 1.8 megampere for the 5 msec launch time. Current, pressure, temperature, optical emission, and X-ray imaging diagnostics are mounted on the railgun or along the transport tube. The railgun is designed to be reconfigurable for experimental modification and for ease of diagnostic access. It is capable of producing current densities of hundreds of kA/cm  2  , bore pressuresof thousands of atmospheres, and launch velocities of over 2 km/s. INSTRUMENTATION: Projectile velocities are measured using magnetic field probes and voltage probes spaced along the length of the railgun. Thermocouples and pressure diagnostics are mounted on the rails and insulators inside of the containment. Optical spectrometers and fast framing cameras are used to observe the launch. A dual-axis Xray imager is located in the transport tube to image the projectile before it is destroyed in the multi-layered steel plate target. Signals from the probes are recorded in a multichannel digitizer system and analyzed using computer software. Rails and insulators are removed from the bore for analysis using scanning electron microscopy, optical imagers, profilometers, X-ray diffraction, and other detailed materials diagnostic tools.  ",
