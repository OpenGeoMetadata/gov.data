  "notes": "This part of DS 781 presents data for the faults for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Monterey map area, California. The vector data file is included in \"Faults_OffshoreMonterey.zip,\" which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7F47M6T. The shelf north and east of the Monterey Bay Peninsula in the Offshore of Monterey map area is cut by a diffuse zone of northwest striking, steeply dipping to vertical faults comprising the Monterey Bay Fault Zone (MBFZ). This zone, originally mapped by Greene (1977, 1990), extends about 45 km across Monterey Bay (Map E on sheet 9). Fault strands within the MBFZ are mapped with high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles (sheet 8). Seismic-reflection profiles traversing this diffuse zone in the map area cross as many as 5 faults over a width of about 4 to 5 km (see, for example, figs. 3 and 5 on sheet 8). The zone lacks a continuous \"master fault,\" along which deformation is concentrated. Fault length ranges up to about 20 km (based on mapping outside this map area), but most strands are only about 2- to 7-km long. Faults in this diffuse zone cut through Neogene bedrock and locally appear to minimally disrupt overlying inferred Quaternary sediments. The presence of warped reflections along some fault strands suggests that fault offsets may be both vertical and strike-slip. Specific offshore faults within the zone that are continuous with mapped onshore faults include the Navy Fault, Chupines Fault, and Ord Terrace Fault (Clark and others, 1997; Wagner and others, 2002). Carmel Canyon, a relatively straight northwest-trending arm of the Monterey Canyon system, extends through the southwestern part of the Offshore of Monterey map area. Carmel Canyon has three heads (Greene and others, 2002), two of which extend east and northeast into Carmel Bay within the map area; the third head extends southeast along the main canyon trend for about 3 km beyond the confluence with the heads in Carmel Bay. Carmel Canyon is aligned with and structurally controlled by the San Gregorio fault zone (Greene and others, 1991), an important structure in the distributed transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates (see, for example, Dickinson and others, 2005). This Fault Zone is part of a regional fault system that is present predominantly in the offshore for about 400 km, from Point Conception in the south (where it is known as the Hosgri Fault; Johnson and Watt, 2012) to Bolinas and Point Reyes in the north (Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). The San Gregorio Fault Zone in the map area is part of a 90-km-long offshore segment that extends northward from Point Sur (about 24 km south of the map area), across outer Monterey Bay to Point Año Nuevo (51 km north of the map area) (see sheet 9; see also, Weber and Lajoie, 1980; Brabb and others, 1998; Wagner and others, 2002). High-resolution seismic-reflection data collected across the canyon do not clearly image the San Gregorio Fault Zone, due largely to significant depth and steep canyon walls. Accordingly, we have mapped the 1,000- 1,300-m-wide fault zone largely on the presence of prominent, lengthy, geomorphic lineaments (sheets 1 and 2) and both geomorphic and lithologic contrasts across the fault. Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see OFR 2013-1071). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.
