  "notes": " The Pathology Core is a morphology core facility, which provides histopathology support for intramural researchers. The Core offers a full range of histopathology services and quality control for morphologic studies, experimental pathology (animal models) and optimizes use of supplies and equipment for all investigators at the NHLBI in which morphological studies and tissue-based molecular studies play a critical role. The laboratory is equipped and staffed to perform routine histopathology paraffin and cryo-sections, staining and limited diagnostic pathology for experimental animal phenotype as well as some special procedures. The Core performs all experimental pathology procedures, including tissue function and processing for histsology and immunohistochemistry, embedding in paraffin, sectioning and routine H&amp;amp;E staining. We also perform many special histology staining procedures, including von Kossa Calcium, giemsa, Mason tri-chrome, Oil Red-O (frozen only), Iron, Elastic Van Gieson&amp;#39;s and Movat stain. The Core can process frozen tissue sections, submitted as either frozen or as unfixed fresh tissues. Frozen sections can be cut with the thickness of 6-20 microns upon request and mounted on a Plus charged glass slide. Customized cutting techniques are available, such as embedding multiple organs in the same block, cutting sections of various thickness, mounting multiple sections on the same slide and cutting serial sections through whole organs or embryos for both paraffin and cryo-sections. The Core can perform immunohistochemistry using both chromogenic or fluorescence labeling. Most reagents and equipment necessary for immunostaining procedures are available, including a high power microwave for antigen retrieval protocols and an automated immune-staining device which can load up to 20 slides, using 10 programs for different staining procedures. For pathological imaging acquisition, the Core has both a macroscope and a light microscopy system with two cameras which can provide fluorescence and bright field digital images for data analysis and for publication.
