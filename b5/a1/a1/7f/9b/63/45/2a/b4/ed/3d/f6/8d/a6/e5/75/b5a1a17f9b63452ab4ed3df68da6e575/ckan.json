The vector data file is included in \"Isopachs_SaltPointToDrakesBay.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/SaltPointToDrakesBay/data_catalog_SaltPointToDrakesBay.html. As part of the USGS's California Seafloor Mapping Program, a 20-m grid ofsediment thickness for the seafloor within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters between Salt Point and Drakes Bay was generated from seismic-reflection data collected in 2009 (USGS activity (S-8-09-NC) supplemented with outcrop and geologic structure from sheet DS 781. The resulting grid covers an area of approximately 600 sq km. The volume of sediment accumulated since the Last Glacial Maximum is approximately 9,000 million cubic meters. Contours at 2.5-meter intervals were derived from this grid.",
