  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Integrated Support Environment (ISE) Laboratory serves the fleet, in-service engineers, logisticians and program management offices by automatically and periodically providing key decision makers with the big picture tools and actionable metrics needed for informed decision making within the realm of Support Equipment (SE) and Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) system improvements.  Function:  The ISE Laboratory at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ correlates cross-competency data to provide meaningful metrics. The lab provides a distributed data system that achieves the lab&amp;#39;s mission of providing actionable metrics by combining multiple data sources and leveraging automated data feeds for near real-time situational awareness across all phases of a program including design, development, test and operational deployment all within a single system interface.  Capabilities:  The ISE Lab utilizes corporate toolsets to provide business intelligence to Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) leadership. The ISE Lab provides pertinent metrics to the fleet, engineers, logisticians and program management users on demand. The lab also utilizes specialized software to provide a thorough analysis of the data being collected, which allows for data mining, data cleansing, processing and modeling to identify and visualize trends. Moreover, the lab has defined and implemented streamlined processes for collecting data, performing data mining techniques and providing pertinent data metrics, via reports or dashboards, to decision makers.
