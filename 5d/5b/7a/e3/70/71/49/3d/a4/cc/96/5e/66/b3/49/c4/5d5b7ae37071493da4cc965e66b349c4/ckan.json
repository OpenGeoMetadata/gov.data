    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Makel Engineering and BAE Systems propose to develop processes to\nmanufacture plastics and composites for radiation shielding based on In\nSitu Resources Utilization (ISRU).  The production of plastics and\ncomposites will also serve as feedstock for In Situ Manufacturing of a\nvariety of useful components, such as inflatable structures, replacement\nparts, etc.  The direction set to NASA by the President on January 2004\nplaced high emphasis on a robust space exploration program.  Affordable\nplanning and execution of prolonged manned space missions depend upon\nthe utilization of local resources (e.g., soil, atmosphere, etc.) and\nthe waste products which are formed in manned spacecraft and surface\nbases.  The purpose of the investigation is to develop materials and\nassociated processing technologies for habitat structure on planetary\nsurfaces to effectively shield humans and sensitive electronics such as\nsolar arrays and integrated circuits from the harmful effect of deep\nspace radiation environment.  Unlike Earth, on the Lunar or Martian\nsurface, there is practically no protection from primary deep space\nradiation sources such as Solar Particle Events (SPEs) and Galactic\nCosmic Rays (GCRs).  SPEs produce intermittent and extremely high fluxes\nof charged energetic particles associated with major solar flares.",
