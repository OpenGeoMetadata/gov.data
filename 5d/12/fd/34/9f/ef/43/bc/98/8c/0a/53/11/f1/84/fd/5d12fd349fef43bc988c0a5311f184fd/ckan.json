    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\nThe Nenana river in the Interior of Alaska usually freezes over during\nOctober and November. The ice continues to grow throughout the winter\naccumulating an average maximum thickness of about 110 cm, depending\nupon winter weather conditions.\n\nThe Nenana River Ice Classic competition began in 1917 when railroad\nengineers bet a total of 800 dollars, winner takes all, guessing the exact time (month, day, hour, minute) ice on the Nenana River would\nbreak up. Each year since then, Alaska residents have guessed at the\ntiming of the river breakup. A tripod, connected to an on-shore clock\nwith a string, is planted in two feet of river ice during river\nfreeze-up in October or November. The following spring, the clock\nautomatically stops when the tripod moves as the ice breaks up. The\ntime on the clock is used as the river ice breakup time.\n\nMany factors influence the river ice breakup, such as air temperature,\nice thickness, snow cover, wind, water temperature, and depth of water\nbelow the ice. Generally, the Nenana river ice breaks up in late April\nor early May (historically, April 20 to May 20). The time series of\nthe Nenana river ice breakup dates can be used to indicate climate\nchange in the region.\n",
