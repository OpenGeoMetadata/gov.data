    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA is interested in advancing green technology research for achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Thermo-electric power generation (TEPG) has exceptionally rich potential to fulfill this need. A TEPG module requires (1) material that can provide high figure of merit while still providing efficient heat control; (2) low resistance ohmic contacts that operate at high temperature; and (3) efficient heat sink material to provide optimal temperature difference between hot and cold junctions. In Phase I, we addressed all of these issues. We successfully produced device quality n-type and p-type, single crystalline and bulk nano-composite PbTe material suitable for TEPG device fabrication. We also developed a novel electrical contact technology having low electrical resistance and capability to withstand significantly elevated temperatures (&gt;800 degree C). And we developed a light weight, highly thermal conductive (50 to 60 &#37; better than copper) heat sink material with tailored low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). These improvements allowed us to develop the design and technique for fabrication of large scale TEPG on a manufacturing level. In Phase II we will expand upon these developments and implement them. We will fabricate TEPG devices using the nano-composite materials. These devices will utilize the ohmic contacts and the heat sink technology that we developed. We will also utilize another approach that we developed in which two materials (PbTe and (Bi-Sb)2(Se-Te)3  based alloys) are segmented into a two-part material that has high efficiency over the entire temperature range from 200-500 degreeC, PbTe being at the hot end and the (Bi-Sb)2(Se-Te)3 based material at the cold end. Our ultimate goal will be to build a TEPG module using such segmented devices to demonstrate the generation of 1kWatt of power. We will develop the technology of fabricating these modules at a large scale manufacturing level, at low cost.",
