  "notes": "CAMEO is the umbrella name for a system of software applications used widely to plan for and respond to chemical emergencies. All of the programs in the suite work interactively to share and display critical information in a timely fashion; the programs can also be used individually. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is a hazard modeling tool used to evaluate the atmospheric dispersion of hazardous chemical vapors, as well as some fires and explosions. ALOHA prompts the user to enter basic scenario information (such as weather conditions and details about how the chemical is escaping), and ALOHA will create a threat zone estimate of the area where a hazard (such as toxicity or thermal radiation) has exceeded a user-specified Level of Concern (LOC). CAMEO is a database application (with eight modules) designed to assist with the data management requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). CAMEO Chemicals features an extensive database of chemical datasheets that provide critical response information, including physical properties, health hazards, air and water hazards, and recommendations for firefighting, first aid, and spill response. Additionally, it also has a reactivity prediction tool that can be used to estimate what hazards (such as explosions or chemical fires) could occur if chemicals were to mix together. MARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks) is a mapping program; users can quickly view and modify maps, and they can create their own objects to place on the maps. ALOHA threat zones can be displayed on a map in MARPLOT, and objects on the map (such as facilities) can be linked to related records in the CAMEO program. Tier2 Submit is an adjunct program in the suite, which allows users to complete EPCRA Tier II forms electronically. The facility, chemical inventory, and contact information entered into Tier2 Submit can also be imported into the corresponding modules in CAMEO.",

Its computations represent a compromise between accuracy and speed: it has been designed to produce good results quickly enough to be of use to responders. It is intended to be used for estimating threat zones for short range, short duration chemical accidents; a threat zone is the area where a hazard (such as toxicity, flammability, thermal radiation, or damaging overpressure) has exceeded a user-specified Level of Concern (LOC). Results produced by ALOHA are estimates and should not be considered precise answers. ALOHA results can be unreliable when the following conditions exist: very low wind speeds, very stable atmospheric conditions, or concentration patchiness (particularly near the spill source). ALOHA does not account for the effects of byproducts from fires, explosions, or chemical reactions; particulates; chemical mixtures; wind shifts and terrain steering effects; terrain; or hazardous fragments.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
