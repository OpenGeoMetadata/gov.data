  "notes": "This part of SIM 3261 presents data for the seafloor-character map (see sheet 5, SIM 3261) of the Offshore of Carpinteria map area, California. The raster data file is included in \"SeafloorCharacter_OffshoreCarpinteria.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreCarpinteria/data_catalog_OffshoreCarpinteria.html. This raster-format seafloor-character map shows five substrate classes of Offshore of Carpinteria map area. The five substrate classes mapped in this area have been colored to indicate which of the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes they belong: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), and Slope Class 1, 0 degrees to 5 degrees (flat). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zones 4 and 5 (greater than 100 m), and Slopes Classes 2 to 4, greater than 5 degrees (sloping to vertical) are not present in this map area. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
