    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Structural damage to ball grid array interconnects incurred during vibration testing has been monitored in the prefailure space using resistance spectroscopy-based state space vectors, rate of change of the state variable, and acceleration of the state variable. The technique is intended for condition monitoring in high reliability applications where the knowledge of impending failure is critical and the risks in terms of loss of functionality are too high to bear. Future state of the system has been estimated based on a second-order Kalman Filter model and a Bayesian Framework. The measured state variable has been related to the underlying interconnect damage in the form of inelastic strain energy density. Performance of the prognostic health management algorithm during the vibration test has been quantified using performance evaluation metrics. The method- ology has been demonstrated on leadfree area-array electronic assemblies subjected to vibration. Model predictions have been correlated with experimental data. The presented approach is applicable to functional systems where corner interconnects in area-array packages may be often redundant. Prognostic metrics including α − λ precision, β accuracy, and relative accuracy have been used to assess the performance of the damage proxies. The presented approach enables the estimation of residual life based on level of risk averseness.",
