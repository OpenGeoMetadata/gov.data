  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 30x30 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of the multibeam bathymetry of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 2007 by the NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the College of Charleston, as well as the personal aboard the NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson , and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the South Atlantic Bight from 05/23/2007 to 05/28/2007. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option \"BASE Surface to Image\" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRI Arc10 Spatial Analyst Slope tool extension.",
