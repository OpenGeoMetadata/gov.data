  "notes": "This report is a follow-up to work conducted by the East Lansing Field Office (ELFO) at Seney National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in 1987-88 to assess the presence and degree of contamination in soils and biota due to historic on-site management activities (Best et aJ. 1995). While the onsite activities were found not to have impacted biota, fish collected from several ponds on the refuge were found to have elevated levels of mercury (Hg) in whole fish and skinless fillets. Levels of Hg in the larger northern pike (Esox lucius) exceeded State and Federal criteria for human consumption and interstate trade, respectively (>0.5 and >1.0 ug/g Hg, wet weight, respectively). The sources of the Hg are unknown but may be attributable to aerial transport and deposition from combustion processes at industrial facilities within and outside the Great Lakes basin. Degradation of parent soils and bedrock may also be a local source of Hg. However, the 1987-88 data for Hg in fish were compromised by poor Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) practices by the laboratory contracted by the Patuxent Analytical Control Facility (PACF), U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. PACF reanalyzed a subset of the samples and confirmed the elevated levels of Hg in the fish. Due to the poor QA/QC practices by the contract laboratory and the limited sample size, ELFO concluded it would be premature to recommend altering the management direction at Seney NWR regarding access and consumption of fish by humans and wildlife. ELFO recommended that additional fish collections be undertaken for Hg analysis in the future. ELFO further recommended that if Hg continues to be a problem, then an expanded long term assessment of Hg in fish be implemented. This report documents the results of this expanded sampling effort as it relates to human consumption of fish from Seney NWR. The risks to fish-eating wildlife will be addressed in a separate report.",
