    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to prove\nthe feasibility of developing high power density modular power\nelectronic building blocks based upon high temperature silicon carbide\n(SiC) multichip power module (MCPM) technologies. The modular approach\nwill allow for auto-configurable stackable modules to be built up in\nseries and/or parallel configurations (through a &amp;quot;plug and\nplay&amp;quot; fashion) in order to increase overall system power handling\ncapabilities. The MCPM building blocks will utilize a decentralized\ncontrol and communications structure, with a communications network\nestablished between the core silicon-on-insulator (SOI) controllers of\nthe MCPMs, but with no single controller in command of the system. The\ndecentralized control scheme will allow for the construction of highly\nflexible power systems which could perform a wide variety of power\nelectronics applications, including power conversion, motor drive, and\npower distribution functions. In addition, the development of the MCPMs\nwill be based upon high-temperature SiC power electronics technologies,\nthus driving the building block designs towards very miniaturized, high\npower density, high efficiency systems. Due to the high switching\nfrequency capabilities of the SiC power switches, filter and magnetics\ncomponents will also be reduced in size, thus further miniaturizing the\nMCPM building blocks. The reduction in size, weight, and volume will\ncreate significant savings in space launch costs, while the modular\nbuilding block designs will increase flexibility, reduce engineering\ncosts and time, improve reliability and fault tolerance, and allow for\nthe implementation of auto-reconfiguration in the case of phase-leg or\nmodule failures.",
