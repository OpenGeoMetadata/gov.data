    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Ridgetop will develop a superior method for testing and qualifying columnar type of grid arrays such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) packaged in column grid array (CGA) and ceramic column grid array (CCGA) packages using any type of manufacturing process.  \r\nThe proposed innovation is an electrical test method that utilizes unassigned CGA or CCGA package pins as dedicated monitoring pins, with a dedicated Solder Joint Built-in-Self Test (SJ BIST) program in the FPGA. SJ BIST operates in real-time to detect faults, with zero false alarms, in those connections. Supporting software provides a visual status of the state-of-health of each pair of monitored pins. \r\nAt the end of the Phase 1, there will be a prototype HALT definition, a modified SJ BIST firmware designed specifically for use in HALTs (as opposed to being subjected to HALT for evaluation), a designed board with FPGAs programmed with the modified SJ BIST firmware, a prototype software program to support SJ BIST HALTs, at least two electronic boards fabricated and populated for use in developing and testing the software program.\r\nAt the end of the Phase 2, the usefulness and accuracy of SJ BIST HALT will have been proven by the running of the defined HALT regimes.  And by working with industry representatives, SJ BIST HALT will be ready for commercialization by government agencies, by suppliers of electronic boards to government agencies, by commercial firms. \r\n",
