  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Aviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS) Laboratory provides a variety of capabilities to support development efforts and in-service requirements to directly aid the fleet. Specifically, the ADMACS Laboratory is capable of developing, testing and providing life cycle support for data management systems for air and flight operations and aviation centers aboard aircraft carriers.  Function:  Through the use of mock-ups, the ADMACS Lab at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ is able to support the development, integration and testing of advanced concepts in ADMACS. Additionally, the ADMACS Lab utilizes mock-ups to provide system training to fleet personnel prior to system installation or as a refresher course as needed.  Capabilities:  Personnel in the ADMACS Lab combine their expertise to provide a variety of capabilities to their customers from requirements definition to a fielded system that tracks aircraft and helicopter status during recovery, launch and flight deck operation aboard aircraft carriers. The ADMACS Lab also provides a wide range of fleet-support capabilities such as in-service support, test and integration capabilities, prototyping and software support capabilities to name a few. Additionally, the lab is capable of mocking up air operations, Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC), primary flight control and flight deck and hangar deck control spaces to simulate shipboard configuration environments, allowing the accomplishment of real-time workflow.
