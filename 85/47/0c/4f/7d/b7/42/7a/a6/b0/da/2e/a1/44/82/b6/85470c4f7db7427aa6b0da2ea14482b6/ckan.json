It was acquired using the ME70 multibeam sonar system onboard the NOAA ship Bell M. Shimada in March of 2015. Data is in UTM zone 10 north, datum WGS84. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
