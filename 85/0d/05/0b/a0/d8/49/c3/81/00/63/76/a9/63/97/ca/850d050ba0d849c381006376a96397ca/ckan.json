  "notes": "This geodatabase includes spatial datasets that represent the Mississippian aquifer in the States of Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The aquifer is divided into three subareas, based on the data availability. In subarea 1 (SA1), which is the aquifer extent in Iowa, data exist of the aquifer top altitude and aquifer thickness. In subarea 2 (SA2), which is the aquifer extent in Missouri, data exist of the aquifer top and bottom aquifer surface altitudes. In subarea 3 (SA3), which is the aquifer area of the remaining States, no altitude or thickness data exist. Included in this geodatabase are: (1) a feature dataset \"ds40MSSPPI_altitude_and_thickness_contours that includes aquifer altitude and thickness contours used to generate the surface rasters for SA1 and SA2, (2) a feature dataset \"ds40MSSPPI_extents\" that includes a polygon dataset that represents the subarea extents, a polygon dataset that represents the combined overall aquifer extent, and a polygon dataset of the Ft. Dodge Fault and Manson Anomaly, (3) raster datasets that represent the altitude of the top and the bottom of the aquifer in SA1 and SA2, and (4) georeferenced images of the figures that were digitized to create the aquifer top- and bottom-altitude contours or aquifer thickness contours for SA1 and SA2. The images and digitized contours are supplied for reference. The extent of the Mississippian aquifer for all subareas was produced from the digital version of the HA-730 Mississippian aquifer extent, (USGS HA-730). For the two Subareas with vertical-surface information, SA1 and SA2, data were retrieved from the sources as described below. 1. The aquifer-altitude contours for the top and the aquifer-thickness contours for the top-to-bottom thickness of SA1 were received in digital format from the Iowa Geologic Survey. The URL for the top was ftp://ftp.igsb.uiowa.edu/GIS_Library/IA_State/Hydrologic/Ground_Waters/Mississippian_aquifer/mississippian_topography.zip. The URL for the thickness was ftp://ftp.igsb.uiowa.edu/GIS_Library/IA_State/Hydrologic/Ground_Waters/Mississippian_aquifer/mississippian_isopach.zip Reference for the top map is Altitude and Configuration, in feet above mean sea level, of the Mississipian Aquifer modified from a scanned image of Map 1, Sheet 1, Miscellaneous Map Series 3, Mississippian Aquifer of Iowa by P.J. Horick and W.L. Steinhilber, Iowa Geological Survey, 1973; IGS MMS-3, Map 1, Sheet 1 Reference for the thickness map is Distribution and isopach thickness, in feet, of the Mississipian Aquifer, modified from a scanned image of Map 1, Sheet 2, Miscellaneous Map Series 3, Mississippian Aquifer of Iowa by P.J. Horick and W.L. Steinhilber, Iowa Geological Survey, 1973; IGS MMS-3, Map 1, Sheet 2 2. The altitude contours for the top and bottom of SA2 were digitized from georeferenced figures of altitude contours in U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1305 (USGS PP1305), figure 6 (for the top surface) and figure 9 (for the bottom surface). The altitude contours for SA1 and SA2 were interpolated into surface rasters within a GIS using tools that create hydrologically correct surfaces from contour data, derive the altitude from the thickness (depth from the land surface), and merge the subareas into a single surface. The primary tool was an enhanced version of \"Topo to Raster\" used in ArcGIS, ArcMap, Esri 2014. ArcGIS Desktop: Release 10.2 Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research Institute. The raster surfaces were corrected in areas where the altitude of the top of the aquifer exceeded the land surface, and where the bottom of an aquifer exceeded the altitude of the corrected top of the aquifer.",
