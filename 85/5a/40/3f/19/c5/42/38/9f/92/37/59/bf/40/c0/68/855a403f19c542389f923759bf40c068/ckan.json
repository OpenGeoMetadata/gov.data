    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The 3D Printing In Zero-G (3D Print) technology demonstration project is a proof-of-concept test designed to assess the properties of melt deposition modeling additive manufacturing in the microgravity environment experienced on the International Space Station (ISS). The lessons learned from this technology demonstration will be used for the next generation of melt deposition modeling in the permanent NanoRacks Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) as well as for any future additive manufacturing technology NASA plans to use, such as metals or electronics in-space manufacturing, on both the ISS and Deep Space Missions. This demonstration is the first step towards realizing a &amp;ldquo;machine shop&amp;rdquo; in space, a critical enabling component of any Deep Space Mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D Print payload consists of a 3D printer (a two-axis extruder mobility system, a single-axis print tray mobility system, the extruder and accompanying feedstock cartridge, the print tray, Environmental Control Unit (ECU, a prototype for the permanent AMF), an electronics box, and all of the necessary cables and bolts to attach the device to the ISS Microgravity Science Glovebox&amp;nbsp;(MSG) cold plate, MSG laptop computer, and MSG power supply) and all identified spare parts. The 3D Print payload will operate within the MSG. The payload uses extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology to fabricate objects. Additive manufacturing is the process of creating three dimensional objects from a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model where material is deposited layer by layer. The 3D Print payload will extrude a bead of thermo-polymer material from a larger diameter feedstock material. When one layer is complete, the next layer is printed on top and bonded to the lower layer while still molten. This creates an adhesive bond as opposed to a solid material extrusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance goals were defined realizing the 3D Print is a technology demonstration. The following is a list of minimum success criteria:&lt;br /&gt;1. Successful integration and safe operation in the MSG on the ISS&lt;br /&gt;2. Demonstration of extrusion based additive manufacturing using polymeric material&lt;br /&gt;3. Successful extrusion and traversing&lt;br /&gt;4. Printing of one part while in ISS microgravity&lt;br /&gt;5. Mitigation of functional risks for future facilities&lt;br /&gt;6. Comparison of ISS printed parts with those printed on Earth (dimensional and strength testing).&lt;/p&gt;",
