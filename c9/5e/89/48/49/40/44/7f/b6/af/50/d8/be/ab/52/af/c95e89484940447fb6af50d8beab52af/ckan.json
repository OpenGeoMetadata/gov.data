  "notes": "The purpose of this document is to provide technical guidance on monitoring activities to refuge staff involved in planning and conducting hazardous fuel treatments. This document contains the language of how monitoring protocols were divided into 'core' (required) and 'recommended' elements, and largely follows a template designed by Region 1 and the National Fire Ecology Team and I&M partnership. This US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) Southeast Regional Plan for Monitoring Hazardous Fuels Treatments provides a framework for monitoring the immediate effects of fuels treatment applications on refuges within the Southeast Region. It relies on both established monitoring data collection standards as well as integration with the Serviceâ€™s newly formed Inventory and Monitoring Standards. This plan has been developed to help refuges and the Service provide the needed basic scientific information to make sound management decisions based on adaptive management principles. It is designed to be updated as processes are accepted, rejected and refined.This document provides a guidance plan detailing what information is required by the region to monitor, and recommendations for additional monitoring standards to include immediate treatment effects observed within one year. Guidance and recommendations cover all fuels treatments that primarily meet hazardous fuels reduction treatment objectives. Prescribed fire applications that are implemented to meet other objectives, i.e., biological objectives or habitat improvement objectives should be addressed in the overall Inventory and Monitoring Plan (IMP) for each refuge. The IMP developed for each refuge will include hazardous fuel treatment monitoring goals once it is fully developed. The guidance and recommendations here are meant to serve as an interim plan to allow refuges within the region to continue to perform hazardous fuel treatment monitoring while the IMPs are developed. Details of field techniques and protocols for each monitoring level of variables are provided in the Monitoring Hazardous Fuels Treatments: Southeast Regional Field Guide (USFWS 2013).Inputs into this document have been provided by regional fire, inventory and monitoring (I&M), and biological staff, and has been peer reviewed both within and outside the agency.",
