    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This one year effort had four aspects; complete and document the calibrated spectral intensity of a hydrogen flame, understand the role of atmospheric attenuation on the performance of hydrogen flame detectors, help qualify the performance of the near infrared water measurement instrument used in the NASA Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) project, and build a prototype next-generation ultraviolet hydrogen flame simulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We obtained a calibrated ultraviolet lamp and worked with safety to permit its use.&amp;nbsp; Using this we were able to calibrate our spectrometer for ultraviolet measurements and successfully measured the UV emission of a hydrogen flame. This completed our spectral measurement (we had previously performed measurements from the visible through the far-infrared under program funding). We have documented this effort in a new technology report and in a manuscript that we submitted to the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.&amp;nbsp; This paper has been accepted for publication and appeared in the June 2014 issue of the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We set up an extended tube and filled it with humid air in order to perform some atmospheric absorption measurements.&amp;nbsp; The results have indicated that the new infrared radiation (IR)&amp;nbsp;fire detectors should operate within their design distance even in humid Florida air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have provided significant aid to the Resolve project.&amp;nbsp; We took preliminary data before the spectrometer showed up, we performed analysis, we helped interpret the data provided by their spectrometer, and we&amp;rsquo;ve helped to develop an algorithm to convert their spectral absorbance data into a water vapor concentration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have designed, constructed, and tested a new prototype ultraviolet hydrogen flame simulator. A new technology report&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;written and we will be working with KSC Ground Support Development to start the conversion of this device into ground support equipment so that it can be used to certify the ultraviolet fire detectors still being used in the field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;",
