  "notes": "  Geospatial application development, location-based services, spatial modeling, and spatial analysis are examples of the many research applications that this facility supports  Provides Cutting-edge Geospatial Expertise Located at the ERDC Environmental Laboratory in Vicksburg, Miss., the Geospatial Data Analysis Facility (GDAF) provides cutting-edge geospatial expertise for a wide range of civil and military applications. GDAF scientists are able to create custom Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) applications, develop complex spatial models, and acquire and process remotely-sensed data to support many types of research and operational needs. GDAF experts are co-located at the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise and on the campus of Louisiana State University, as well as at the Vicksburg site. Gain Access to Expert Research Solutions The facility&amp;#39;s geospatial staff have diverse scientific backgrounds, and are able to provide guidance and solutions for geospatial problems. Whether designing standards-based spatial databases or providing on-site support during field work, this team is ready to help you tackle your geospatial problems. Geospatial staff are highly capable in the following research areas: geostatistics; ground-based and airborne Lidar processing; ground-to-space-based image analysis and feature extraction; spatial analysis; web-delivered GIS; geospatial databases and data structures; geo design; cartography; remote sensing; image analysis; multi-spectral and hyperspectral image analysis; high-volume data processing; application of survey-grade GPS systems; geospatial field methods; multi-temporal landscape dynamics and trend analyses; terrain mapping; biogeographic landscape metric development; spatial simulation; spatial modeling; spatial information theory; and traditional geographic information system development, deployment, customization and use. (long lists with prepositional phrases throughout are more easily-read with semi-colons). Applications The Geospatial Data Analysis Facility supports and conducts a wide variety of research activities, such as:  Integration of map services and spatial queries for MasterDocks+ Location-based spatial applications Climate Change Quantitative Spatial Risk Assessments Spatial Data management Spatial Science Image characterization and classification Spatial modeling for environmental applications Remote Sensing Natural Resources Damage Assessments Geospatial application development Environmental Data processing Sensor Integration Location-based field data collection Lidar processing Success Stories  GDAF researchers provided knowledge management for a study quantifying the risk of Climate Change impacts to Naval Station Norfolk (SERDP 1701).  GDAF experts provided critical support and response for projects related to Superstorm Sandy.  GDAF staff developed techniques to assist USACE districts in the use of time-series output for fluid dynamics models and ecological models within a geographic information system.  GDAF team members supported the Warfighter by researching methods to defeat improvised explosive device (IED) threats.  GDAF experts used hyperspectral imagery to investigate land stability, aquatic vegetation and landscape fragmentation for coastal Louisiana.  ",
