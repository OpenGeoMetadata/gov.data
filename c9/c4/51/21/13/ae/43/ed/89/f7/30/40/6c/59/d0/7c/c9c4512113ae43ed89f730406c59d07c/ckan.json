  "notes": "This coverage maps alluvial deposits throughout Iowa. This generally would include areas of alluvial soils associated with modern streams that are identified on 1:100,000 scale county topographic maps. However, it also includes areas associated with glacial outwash streams from Wisconsinan-age glaciers. Both loess-covered and non loess-covered stream terraces and benches are included as alluvial deposits. In general, these deposits would outline alluvial aquifers, although in some areas the sand and gravel may be thin or unsaturated. Mapping was done on 1:100,000 county maps using the modern county soil survey. In some instances, 1:24,000 topographic maps were used where the interpreter felt it useful. The Des Moines Lobe area was all mapped with the aid of 1:24,000 maps.",
