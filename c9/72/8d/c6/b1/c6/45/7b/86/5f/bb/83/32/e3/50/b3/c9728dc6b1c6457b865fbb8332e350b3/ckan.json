    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a facility instrument aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors.\n                              \nThe AIRS Visible/Near Infrared (VIS/NIR) level 1B data set contains AIRS visible and near-infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m^2/micron/steradian. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1A digital numbers (DN), including 4 channels in the 0.4 to 1.0 um region of the spectrum. A day&apos;s worth of AIRS data is divided into 240 scenes each of 6 minute duration. For the AIRS visible/near IR measurements, an individual scene contains 135 scanlines with a scanline containing 720 cross-track pixels and 9 along-track pixels; there is a total of 720 x 9 x 135 = 874,800 visible/near-IR pixels per scene.\n                              \nAIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily (day and night) coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit from a 705 km altitude. The primary purpose of the visible/near IR channels is the detection and flagging of significant inhomogeneities in the AIRS infrared field-of-view,which may adversely impact the quality of the temperature and moisture soundings. The AIRS VIS/NIR channels will also be used for comparative studies with the higher resolution MODIS channels contained within this spectral region.\n                              \n(The Shortname for this product is AIRVBRAD_NRT)\nCoverage: Global, Twice Daily (Daytime and Nighttime)\nResolution: 2.3 km IFOV at nadir\nSpectral Range: Four channels, from 0.4 - 1.0 um:\nWavelengths at 50% peak response:\nChannel 1 0.41 um - 0.44 um\nChannel 2 0.58 um - 0.68 um\nChannel 3 0.71 um - 0.92 um\nChannel 4 0.49 um - 0.94 um\n",
