    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "KEYWORD SEARCH IN TEXT CUBE: FINDING TOP-K RELEVANT CELLS\r\n\r\nBOLIN DING*, YINTAO YU*, BO ZHAO*, CINDY XIDE LIN*, JIAWEI HAN*, AND CHENGXIANG ZHAI*\r\n\r\nAbstract. We study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s)\r\n(so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database, where each row\r\nis associated with some text data (e.g., a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes).\r\nA cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attribute values in a subset\r\nof dimensions. A cell document is the concatenation of all documents in a cell. Given a keyword\r\nquery, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells (ranked according to the relevance scores of\r\ncell documents w.r.t. the given query) in the text cube.\r\nWe define a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring and\r\nranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k\r\nanswers. The proposed approaches support a general class of IR-style relevance scoring formulas\r\nthat satisfy certain basic and common properties. One of them uses more time for pre-processing\r\nand less time for answering online queries; and the other one is more efficient in pre-processing and\r\nconsumes more time for online queries. Experimental studies on the ASRS dataset are conducted\r\nto verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",
