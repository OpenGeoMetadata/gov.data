  "notes": "This dataset represents depth uncertainty predictions from a bathymetric model developed for the New York offshore spatial planning area. The model also includes spatially-explicit depth estimates represented in another raster dataset. Uncertainty is defined as the standard error of depth estimates from model output. The model used to derive depth estimates and corresponding uncertainty builds on previous predictive bathymetric modeling approaches in the region (e.g. Calder, 2006), provides a continuous gridded bathymetric surface, and allows users to view and explore spatial variation in the vertical accuracy of depth predictions. The spatial resolution of the model is identical to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Relief Model (CRM; horizontal resolution approximately 83.8 m) in the study area and was built from the same database of hydrographic survey points.",
