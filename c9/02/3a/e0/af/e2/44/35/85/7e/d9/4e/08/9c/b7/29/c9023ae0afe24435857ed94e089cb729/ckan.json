  "notes": " The Fabrication Facilities are a direct result of years of testing support. Through years of experience, the three fabrication facilities (Fort Hood, Fort Lewis, and Fort Huachuca) have developed a capability to not only design and fabricate prototypes but can take concepts through design, fabrication and fielding. The specialty areas are the Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs), related C4I systems, and shelter hardware integration to include Standard Integrated Command Post Systems (SICPS) and Large Scale SICPS (LSS). This capability has been extended to various PMs for the production of &amp;quot;one of a kind&amp;quot; and prototype shelters, as well as providing field maintenance support to various platforms not readily supported by the normal Integrated Logistical Support System (ILS). Through the support provided to PMs EPG has an extensive knowledge of TOC requirements from the battalion to the corps level.   EPG has been instrumental in the fabrication of several specialized TOCs, the upgrade of the M577 to the M1068, and modifications to the C2V. We have provided various shelter interconnect systems such as tents with bootwalls that attach to the various vehicles and shelters, providing a large work area in the tactical environment. We have also designed and fabricated systems that provide an interconnected walkway between the various TOC shelters. These walkways are an integral part of the vehicle and shelter and eliminate the need for additional prime movers to transport walkways and ramps  ",
