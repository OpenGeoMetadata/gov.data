  "notes": "This part of DS 781 presents data for faults for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area, California. The vector data file is included in \"Faults_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreHalfMoonBay/data_catalog_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.html. The Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area lies about 12 km southwest of the San Andreas Fault, the dominant structure in the distributed, right-lateral, transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates. The map area straddles the right-lateral San Gregorio Fault, the most important structure west of the San Andreas Fault in this broad zone. The San Gregorio is part of fault system that occurs predominantly in the offshore, extending about 400 km from Point Conception on the south to Bolinas and Point Reyes on the north (Dickinson and others, 2005), intersecting land at a few coastal promontories. In the Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area, the San Gregorio Fault forms a distributed shear zone about 2 to 4.5 km wide that includes two primary diverging fault strands. The eastern strand (also known as the Seal Cove Fault or Coastways Fault) roughly parallels the shoreline, lies onshore for about 3 km at Pillar Point, and locally forms the boundary between outcrops of Cretaceous grantic rocks to the east and Purisima Formation to the west. The western strand (also known as the Frijoles Fault) lies entirely offshore and forms a boundary between the Purisima Formation on the east and undifferentiated Cretaceous and (or) Tertiary rocks (Pigeon Point Formation?) of the Pigeon Point structural block (McCulloch, 1987) on the west. The Pigeon Point block forms a northwest-trending bedrock ridge that extends offshore for about 30 km from Pescadero Point and forms the northwest boundary of the outer Santa Cruz Basin (McCulloch, 1987). Cumulative lateral slip on the San Gregorio Fault zone is thought to range from 4 to 10 mm/yr in this region (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010). Bathymetric (Bathymetry--Offshore Half Moon Bay, California, DS 781) and seismic-reflection data (see field activity S-15-10-NC) reveal that the offshore outcrops of the Purisima Formation between the eastern and western strands of the San Gregorio Fault Zone are spectacularly folded, faulted and rotated by the strike-slip motion and drag along the faults. The entire map area lies along strike with the young, high topography of the Santa Cruz Mountains and Coast Ranges. This regional uplift has been linked to a northwest transpressive bend in the San Andreas Fault (for example, Zoback and others, 1999). Uplift of nearby marine terraces at rates up to 0.44 mm/yr confirms that this uplift includes the coastal zone (Weber and others, 1995). Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activity S-15-10-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.
