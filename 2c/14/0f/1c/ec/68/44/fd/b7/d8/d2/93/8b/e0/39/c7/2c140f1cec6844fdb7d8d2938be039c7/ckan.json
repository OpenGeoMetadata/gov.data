    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Crew behavioral health and performance are of high importance,\nespecially for long duration exploration missions. Early detection of\nstress and effective options for restoration and enhancement of\nbehavioral health are imperative for accomplishment of mission\nobjectives and for maintaining a productive spaceflight environment. To\naddress the behavioral health issues during exploration missions, the\nNASA Behavioral Health and Performance Program Element (BHP) is looking\nfor a non-invasive technology that would unobtrusively, and with minimal\ncrew time and effort: monitor physiological markers of stress; offer\ncountermeasures for maintenance and restoration of behavioral health;\nand identify methods to prevent decrements in behavioral health. The\nprimary goal of this project is the development of a tool to provide\nBehavioral Monitoring and Evaluation for the Delivery of Interactive\nCognitive behavioral therapy (B-MEDIC).  During Phase I we will provide\nan analysis of measures and technologies for physiologically monitoring,\nassessing and treating stress; and provide requirements for the\ntechnological enhancements necessary to produce B-MEDIC. By the end of\nPhase II, our multi-disciplinary team proposes to develop a functioning\nprototype of B-MEDIC to address the following gaps outlined in the BHP\nIntegrated Research Plan (July 2010): BMED1, BMED2, and BMED6. (Phase I\nTRL: Beginning 1, End 3)",
