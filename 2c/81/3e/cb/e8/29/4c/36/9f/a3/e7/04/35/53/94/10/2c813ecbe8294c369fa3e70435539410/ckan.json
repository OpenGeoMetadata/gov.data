  "notes": "Studies to establish a limnological baseline and determine the effects, if any, of off-refuge placer mining on Tuluksak River's aquatic resources were carried out during Fiscal Years 1987 to 1989. Extensive placer mining has already adversely impacted much of the riverine, riparian and floodplain habitat of the upper Tuluksak River drainage, upstream from the eastern boundary of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). The need for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) to determine the impacts, if any, from placer mining on the Tuluksak River is great because: 1) placer mining increases the bioavailability of selected trace elements and heavy metals and therefore increases the likelihood of their being transferred through the food chain into Service trust resources; 2) subsistence resources may be threatened; and 3) water quality may be degraded. Limnological information and analytical data collected during non-mining periods indicate that the Tuluksak River's water quality meets state water quality standards. No sediment levels exceeded Service-derived criteria; however, sediment collected in, and downstream of, mined sites contained significantly greater concentrations of trace elements and heavy metals than those levels found in control samples. Total metals concentrations in fish collected from mining-influenced sites were not significantly greater than those fish samples collected from control sites. Furthermore, concentrations in fish were below Service DRAFT tissue criteria associated with expected environmental impacts. No conclusive evidence was found that mining activities have adversely impacted Tuluksak River's water quality or fish population. However, river sediment in, and below, mining operations appears to be accumulating for heavy metals and trace elements. It is hypothesized that substantial alterations in the Tuluksak River's water quality (e.g., pH, alkalinity), could release the accumulated heavy metals and trace elements into the water column, making them bioavailable and causing adverse impacts to the River's aquatic resources. It is also speculated that the Fog River and Otter Creek significantly influence the lower Tuluksak River's chemical characteristics. This three year study has contributed significantly to describing the Tuluksak River's baseline condition. It will be prudent to conduct additional and more extensive monitoring on a regular schedule (every two or three years; during and not-during mining activity) if contaminant problems associated with placer mining are to be discovered. The frequency of sampling should be adjusted to reflect the degree of mining activity that may affect Refuge resources.",
