  "notes": "The unsewered communities file was originally conceived as a representation of communities without a municipal sewer system or on-site septic systems. The selection of communities was based on criteria established by a committee of DNR staff (Brent Parker, Field Office 5, Todd Bishop, GIS Section and Scott Vanderhart, Director's Office). The committee decided to look for groups of ten houses or more clumped within a 10 acre area which did not fall into an incorporated area. The areas that were detected were characterized into 1 of 2 classes: Officially Named, Unincorporated Towns (from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) shapefile) or Unamed but Developed Rural Subdivisions. To attribute the data, the unincorporated GNIS point file was joined with 2000 census data (Population, Median House Income, Housing Units, and Occupancy). For the rural subdivisions, polygons were digitized around these areas in ArcView 3.2a using 2002 color-infrared aerial photography and USGS digital topographic maps (DRGs). A point file was then generated using the polygons' centroids and attributed with the number of visible housing units observed within the corresponding polygon boundaries. The resulting two point files were then merged and the sites were assessed to determine if they had access to a wastewater treatment plant. The polygon and point files were both used as an initial source of locations for potentially unsewered communities. Digital incorporated area files from 1990 census data were used to exclude communities that fell within the boundaries of known incorporated areas. The product of this analysis was then submitted for review to county sanitarians and rural water entities. After receiving their responses, some communities were removed from, and others added to, the initial file. The reviewers also added comments in regard to specific communities.",
