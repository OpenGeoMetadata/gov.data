    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the results of spectral reflectance (350 to 2,500 nm at 1-nm increments) and biophysical measurements on grass pastures in eight cattle ranches in the state of Rondonia, located in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. The ranches are located near the cities of Porto Velho, Ariquemes, Ouro Preto, Ji-Parana, and Presidente Medici. Field measurements were collected in July and August 2003. The primary grass species sampled were Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens. Spectrometer measurements were taken at 5-m intervals along 100 m transects on the pastures - fourteen total transects. Vegetation was sampled at 20-m intervals along the transects. All standing biomass and litter on the soil surface were collected and separated into live and senesced biomass and then dried to calculate water content. Sixty-eight reflectance spectra coincided with grass biophysical samples.Note that the research was done on private lands in Rondonia, and to protect the privacy of those land owners no geographic information is associated with the reported measurements. Three data files are included: an ENVI spectral library file with reflectance data for 484 pasture sampling points, an ASCII comma-separated file with reflectance data for the 484 pasture sampling points, and an ASCII comma-separated file with the biophysical measurements.",
