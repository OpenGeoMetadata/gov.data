  "notes": "The purpose of this habitat management plan (HMP) is to provide a strategic plan for consistently and effectively protecting, acquiring, enhancing, restoring, and managing wetland and grassland habitat for waterfowl and other priority migratory bird species in the District. A recently completed North Dakota Wetland Management Districts Comprehensive Conservation Plan and a North Dakota Limited-interest National Wildlife Refuges CCP provide overarching authority and guidance regarding habitat acquisition, protection, and management in the District. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has selected strategic habitat conservation (SHC) as its business model for conservation which requires that conservation delivery be focused at the landscape level, along with resource allocation, in areas that will have the greatest conservation benefit to priority trust species. The need for efficient conservation delivery is great because of recent acceleration in wetland drainage and conversion of grasslands for agricultural purposes throughout the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR; Stephens et al. 2008, Fargione et al. 2009, Oslund et al. 2010, Doherty et al. 2013, Johnston 2013, Wright and Wimberley 2013, Johnston 2014). Staff at Kulm Wetland Management District (District) have prepared an SHC-based HMP, to direct conservation delivery in landscapes that can support the highest biological outcomes for priority migratory bird species such as breeding waterfowl (Anas spp). The District primarily protects wetland and grassland habitat in perpetuity on 126,519 acres of wetland easements and 61,029 acres of grassland easements and on 45,302 acres of fee-title waterfowl production areas (WPAs; N =201). This HMP uses defensible science including empirical species-habitat relationship models to link conservation of priority species at the scale of Kulm WMD to the conservation of their populations within the North Dakota, South Dakota, and northeast Montana portions of the United States PPR. This HMP would be implemented through 2022 when the next revision of the CCP is scheduled to occur. Implementation of SHC also requires that conservation design and delivery be explicitly tied to population objectives (i.e., desired population size, occupancy, demographic rate, densities) in landscapes where the desired biological outcomes are predicted to occur (Johnson et al. 2009). Staff at Kulm WMD has selected the following population objectives to guide conservation delivery within the SHC design during the next 8 years: 1) Target wetland conservation in landscapes that support >=25 breeding duck pairs/mi2 to maximize carrying capacity levels for breeding waterfowl (Anas spp.) and contribute to stable populations within the PPR; 2) Target grassland conservation in landscapes that support >=60 breeding duck pairs/mi2 (Anas spp.) and nest success levels above population maintenance levels (>=15-20% nest success)(Cowardin et al. 1985) to maximize waterfowl production and contribute to stable populations within the Prairie Pothole Region; 3) Increase habitat protection in landscapes that support high brood occupancy rates (Walker et al.2013a) characterized by high densities of small- to mid-size wetland basins and a high proportion of grassland within a 4 mi2 area to maintain waterfowl recruitment potential within the Prairie Pothole Region; 4) Target habitat conservation in landscapes that support high densities of priority wetland- and grassland-dependent migratory bird species identified in this HMP. The goals, objectives, and strategies included in this HMP are linked to the SHC population objectives using a waterfowl-based landscape classification model that functions as a decision support tool to target resource allocation in landscapes where biological potential is the highest to support waterfowl carrying capacity, waterfowl production, and meet the habitat requirements of priority wetland- and grassland dependent migratory birds.",
