    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains one text file (.csv format) that provides productivity data for four contrasting tundra vegetation types studied during 1982 near Toolik Lake in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range on the North Slope of Alaska (68.63 N 149.72 W). The vegetation types include a \"tussock\" tundra containing graminoids, deciduous shrubs, and evergreen shrubs; a \"shrub\" tundra dominated by deciduous willow shrubs; a \"heath\" tundra of evergreen shrubs; and a \"wet\" tundra site containing rhizomatous graminoids. The study sites were selected to represent extreme examples of the wide range of local plant growth forms in the region.Living above- and below-ground biomass were sampled on three occasions during the growing season using randomly located quadrats ranging in size from 10 cm x 20 cm to 50 cm x 50 cm. Production and biomass of most tissues were determined by harvest methods, with additional separate determinations of stem secondary growth and below-ground rhizome growth as components of net primary production (NPP). Elemental content of above-ground samples was analyzed. Production, biomass, and elemental content of roots were not determined. Leaf area index (LAI) was measured using a LI-COR leaf area meter.NPP, excluding fine roots, was estimated at 37, 99, 278, and 475 g/m2/year, at the heath, wet, tussock, and shrub sites, respectively. Inclusion of estimated production by roots increased these NPP figures to 140, 200, 430, and 780 g/m2/year, respectively. Leaf area index was similarly ranked.",
