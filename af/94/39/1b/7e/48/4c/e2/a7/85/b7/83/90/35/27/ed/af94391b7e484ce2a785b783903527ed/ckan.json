    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Numerous ground test and wind tunnel facilities are used extensively to generate forces and moments as well as surface measurements of test articles required to validate computational tools used to extrapolate wind tunnel data to realistic flight conditions and hardware.  Accurately mapping velocity flow fields remains a significant challenge in these facilities.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of flow parameters such as density, pressure, and temperature are of paramount importance.  Intrusive probe type devices disturb the flow field while traditional particle-seeded techniques are not feasible in shock layers or stagnation regions.  Seeded molecular tagging approaches can not only alter the mean flow, but also introduce unsteady disturbances and requires sufficient upstream seeding in order to diffuse into the boundary layer.  Additionally, seeding can contaminate the tunnels, can become expensive, and reduce the effective run time.  This proposal offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and flow diagnostics for ground test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed are ranging from proof-of-principles demonstration of novel methodologies using kHz-rate femtosecond (10-15 sec) duration laser sources to measurements in realistic tunnel conditions expected in the current solicitation.  In addition, the technologies and tools developed will be packages into robust and user-friendly testing platforms enabling dual use capability in both ground and inflight-test environments.",
