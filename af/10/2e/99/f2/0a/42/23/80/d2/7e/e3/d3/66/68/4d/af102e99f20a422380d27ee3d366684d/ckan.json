    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In previous papers, we introduced the idea of a Virtual Sensor,  which is a mathematical model trained to learn the potentially  nonlinear relationships between spectra for a given image scene for the purpose of predicting values of a subset of those spectra when only partial measurements have been taken. Such models can be created for a variety of disciplines including the Earth and Space Sciences as well as engineering domains. These nonlinear relationships are induced by the physical characteristics of the  image scene. In building a Virtual Sensor a key question that arises is that of characterizing the stability of the model as the underlying scene changes. For example, the spectral relationships could change for a given physical location, due to seasonal weather conditions. This paper, based on a talk given at the American Geophysical Union (2005), discusses the stability of predictions through time and also demonstrates the use of a Virtual Sensor in making multi-resolution predictions. In this scenario, a model is trained to learn the nonlinear relationships between spectra at a low resolution in order to predict the spectra at a high resolution.",
