    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\"We propose to develop a revolutionary x-ray camera for astrophysical imaging spectroscopy. High-resolution x-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the evolving universe. Emission line ratios (e.g. within the He-like triplet) provide density and temperature diagnostics. Emission and absorption line energies identify ions and determine their velocities, and the shape of the lines can be used to study turbulence or the relativistic effects of a supermassive black hole. The grating spectrometers on the XMM and Chandra satellites demonstrated the power of high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy for astrophysics, but there remains a need for instrumentation that can provide higher spectral resolution with high throughput in the Fe-K band and that can enable spatial/spectral investigations of extended sources, such as supernova remnants and galaxy clusters. The instrumentation needed is a broad-band imaging spectrometer - basically an x-ray camera that can precisely resolve x-ray energies and fluxes over a large field-of-view.\n\n\n\n While we do not claim that in 3 years we will have developed such detectors, we advocate developing the technology that has the greatest potential for achieving this. Theoretically, magnetically-coupled microcalorimeters are best equipped to achieve sub-eV energy resolution in very large formats. We propose to build upon the work carried out by our group on metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMC) in the antecedent program. The great promise of MMCs for sub-eV energy resolution has been recognized for years. During our current research program, an accident in detector fabrication produced devices that derived their sensitivity from a different operating principle - the temperature dependence of a superconduc",
