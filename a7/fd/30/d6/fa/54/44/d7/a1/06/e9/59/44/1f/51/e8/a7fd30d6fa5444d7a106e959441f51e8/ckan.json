    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Damage caused by composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) failure can be catastrophic. Thus, monitoring condition and stress in the composite overwrap, including the fiber layers most prone to failure is needed during both preflight qualification and spaceflight. We will develop practical Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) capability for use during spaceflight and surface mounted magnetic stress gages (MSGs) for preflight qualifications/testing and in-flight monitoring.  NDE will address damage produced by impacts from micro-meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD). In addition, we will investigate the need to inspect through multi-layer insulation layer (MLI).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to demonstrate feasibility of (i) volumetric stress monitoring using light weight, surface mounted MSGs, and (ii) practical, portable and easy to interpret NDE for use by crews during spaceflight, with limited training and minimal logistics support. Dual purpose electronics will be adapted to the constraints of spaceflight for NDE and MSG data acquisition and the feasibility of developing extremely light weight and small form factor electronics suitable for space flight will be investigated. This proposal is founded on successful implementations of JENTEK MWM-Array technology for the Space Shuttle leading edge RCC and recent feasibility demonstrations for MSG volumetric stress monitoring on COPV sections. The MWM-Arrays and MSGs use linear drive winding constructs to selectively induce eddy currents in different fiber layers to assess damage and monitor stresses.\r\n",
