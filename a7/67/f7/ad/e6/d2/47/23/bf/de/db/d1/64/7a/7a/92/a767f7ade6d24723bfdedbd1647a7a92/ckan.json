  "notes": "This report represents the preliminary results of the first year of the multiyear study, The Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Complex) Environmental Contaminants Background Survey. The goal is to establish a baseline for future studies and to assist the managers in identifying potential impacts to fish and wildlife resources from environmental contaminants. Sediment and surface water were sampled at the two largest refuges of the Complex, Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and Oyster Bay NWR, in 1990. Surface water, sediment pore water, and sediment samples were assessed for biological toxicity. Sediment was analyzed for inorganic and organic chemical residues. In addition, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) were collected from Wertheim NWR to assess inorganic and organic chemical burdens in wildlife. The toxicity induced by sediment from three sites in Oyster Bay NWR indicated adverse impacts to aquatic organisms. The specific cause of the toxicity may be attributed to the contaminant burdens detected at these sites. Concentrations of lead, copper, nickel, silver, zinc, and some polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found above or near the biological effect levels determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for these contaminants in sediment. The toxicity induced by sediment from a fourth site may be partially attributed to the elevated p,p'DDE. This toxicity may also have been due to contaminants that were not selected for analysis. The slight toxicity induced by sediment from three sites in Wertheim NWR indicated some adverse impacts to aquatic organisms. The specific cause of this toxicity was unclear and may also have been due to contaminants that were not selected for analysis. The contaminant burden at another site that did not induce toxicity, was generally the highest of all the Wertheim NWR sample sites. The contaminant burdens detected in the snapping turtles from Wertheim NWR were generally similar to levels found in other turtle studies. However, turtles from the western portion of the Refuge had a significantly higher polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) concentration than those from the eastern portion. Based on these preliminary results, additional sediment sampling is recommended to further delineate the potential impacts of environmental contaminants to fish and wildlife resources from pollutant sources near Wertheim NWR and Oyster Bay NWR. Collections and additional snapping turtles is recommended to further evaluate the difference in the PCB burdens from the western and eastern portions of Wertheim NWR.",
