  "notes": " FUNCTION:Acts as a surrogate for carrier-based surveillance, engagement, communication relay, combat identification, and command-and-control capable assets of the evolving family of systems warfare architecture. In addition to the integrated AN/APS-145-based airborne early warning/cooperative engagement capability (AEW/CEC) suites, the aircraft is designed to accommodate command and control (C2), electronicwarfare (EW), radar, and electro-optics (EO) research and development programs well into the next century. DESCRIPTION: The NRL Airborne Surveillance Command and Control (ASC2) research aircraft is an NP-3Daircraft integrated with a full E-2C AEW Hawkeye 2000 suite and an Airborne CEC suite to support the Navy&amp;#39;s future AEW/CEC network-centric warfare programs. In addition to the AEW/CEC installation, there are floor and ceiling rails to accommodate six additional operator/equipment consoles in the aft crew compartment, a free-fall sonobuoy chute, space for mounting up to 700 lb of equipment in the forward equipment area, and cross-decked Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Class II equipment. External wing wiring is installed, including fiber optics to support six external electronic pods. The nose radome area has been fitted for a modified Infrared Radiation Detection System (IRDS) turret that can be lowered and raised to support electro-optics projects. Additional structure mountings are in the nose and tail to accommodate the installation of project antennas. The aircraft can accommodate an additional internal payload of up to 2,800 lb, external payloads of up to 10,000 lb, and a crew of up to 16 people, including military flight crew and project scientists. The avionics suite includes a state-of-the-art, digitally controlled analog ICS system; dual INS; SATCOM; GPS; and seven ultra-high-frequency (UHF), four very-high-frequency (VHF), and two high-power high-frequency (HF) communications systems, all of which are secure communications capable and available for project use. Additionally, it is outfitted with four 90 kVA generators, wired to accommodate future growth of two 120 kVA generators  .   ",
