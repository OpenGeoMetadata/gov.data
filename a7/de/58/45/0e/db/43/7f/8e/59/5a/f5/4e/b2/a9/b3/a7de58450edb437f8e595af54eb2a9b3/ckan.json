    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains two ASCII files (.txt format). One file contains monthly above-ground biomass data (total live biomass plus dead matter) for May 1956 to February 1958 for an annually burned, humid derived savanna in the Olokemeji Forest Reserve, Nigeria (7.42 N, 3.55 E) . This file also contains single measurements of above-ground biomass for years 1963 and 1964, single measurements of above-ground biomass at a nearby area for years 1960 and 1964, a single measurement of peak herbaceous leaf area index (LAI) for 1963, and a single measurement of peak tree/shrub LAI for 1964. Harvest procedures were used to measure biomass. LAI was determined by direct measurements. The second file contains climate data (precipitation amount and maximum/minimum temperature) from a weather station at the study site for the period 1956/01/01 through 1964/12/31.Annual above-ground net primary production (ANPP) estimates presented here are the sum of the increase in above-ground plant matter accumulation (total live biomass plus dead matter). ANPP of the herbaceous layer was estimated in 1957 to be around 680 g/m2/yr based on peak total clipped matter.",
