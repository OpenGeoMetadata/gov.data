  "notes": "The American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas cartographic boundary file includes generalized versions of the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs).  The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs).  Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes.  The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.  Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate files because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy.",
