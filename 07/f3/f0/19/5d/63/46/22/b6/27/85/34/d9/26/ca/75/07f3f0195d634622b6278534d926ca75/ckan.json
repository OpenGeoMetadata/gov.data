  "notes": "Anaho Island National Wildlife Refuge is one of three refuges in the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The refuge is located 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) west of the eastern shore of Pyramid Lake in Washoe County, Nevada, within the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe Reservation. Established in 1913, the refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the benefit and protection of colonial nesting birds and other migratory birds. The refuge staff recognized the need for refinement of refuge conservation goals and objectives as well as identification or refinement of critical threats, strategies to address threats, and indicators to measure conservation progress. These needs have been addressed through developing this “Anaho Island National Wildlife Refuge Natural Resource Management Plan” and its companion “Anaho Island National Wildlife Refuge Inventory and Monitoring Plan.” Both of these are stepdown plans from the “Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge Complex Comprehensive Conservation Plan,” which was finalized in 2002. These plans are intended to focus limited refuge resources on activities with the highest likelihood of conservation success. \tThe natural resource management plan has identified colonial nesting waterbirds, colonial nesting waterbird foraging areas, and the Anaho Island ecosystem as priority resources of conservation concern, which are referred to as “conservation targets” throughout the plan. The status of the refuge’s conservation targets—when assessed as a whole using the Conservation Measures Partnership’s Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation methodology—is considered Fair, indicating a level outside the acceptable range of variation and which requires human intervention. Climate change, water use and management, and invasive species were identified as the most critical threats to the refuge’s conservation targets. Key strategies to address these threats were identified, including (1) developing and implementing a water strategy to perpetuate island isolation and conserve important waterbird foraging areas in the surrounding landscape, (2) developing and implementing an integrated pest management plan to address invasive or nuisance plant and animal species, (3) conducting baseline inventories of island biota, (4) conducting island isolation studies to better understand conditions that would lead to formation of a land bridge between Anaho Island and the mainland, and (5) identifying and implementing actions aimed at restoring island biota such as native plant communities. Inventory, monitoring, and research activities to assess the status and trends of conservation targets (goals) and to assess progress on strategy implementation (objectives) are outlined in this natural resource management plan and detailed in the inventory and monitoring plan.",
