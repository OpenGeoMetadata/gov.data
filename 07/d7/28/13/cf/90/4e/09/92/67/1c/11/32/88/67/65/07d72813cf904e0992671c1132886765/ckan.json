    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This paper discusses our initial efforts in constructing physics of failure models for electrolytic capacitors subjected to electrical stressors in DC-DC power converters. Electrolytic capacitors and MOSFETâ€™s are known to be the primary causes for degradation and failure in DC-DC converter systems. We have employed a topological energy based modeling scheme based on the bond graph (BG) modeling language for building parametric models of multi-domain systems, such as motors and pumps. In previous work, we have conducted experimental studies to validate an empirical physics of failure model based on Arrhenius Law for equivalent series resistance (ESR) increase in electrolytic capacitors operating under nominal conditions. In this paper, our focus shifts to deriving first principle models of capacitor degradation that explain both the ESR increase and the decrease in capacitance over time when the capacitor is operated under electrical stress conditions. Experimental studies are run in parallel, and data collected from these studies are used to validate the generated models. In the future, they will also be used to compute model parameters, so that the overall goal of deriving accurate models of capacitor degradation, and using them to predict performance changes in DC-DC converters is realized.",
