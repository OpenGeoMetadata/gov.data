    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "**Abstract**\r\n\r\nPrognostics solutions for mission critical systems require a comprehensive methodology for proactively detecting and isolating failures, recommending and guiding condition-based maintenance actions, and estimating in real time the remaining useful life of critical components and associated subsystems.\r\n\r\nA major challenge has been to extend the benefits of prognostics to include computer servers and other electronic components. The key enabler for prognostics capabilities is monitoring time series signals relating to the health of executing components and subsystems. Time series signals are processed in real time using pattern recognition for proactive anomaly detection and for remaining useful life estimation. Examples will be presented of the use of pattern recognition techniques for early detection of a number of mechanisms that are known to cause failures in electronic systems, including: environmental issues; software aging; degraded or failed sensors; degradation of hardware components; degradation of mechanical, electronic, and optical interconnects. Prognostics pattern classification is helping to substantially increase component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing costly sources of \"no trouble found\"\r\n\r\nevents that have become a significant warranty-cost issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Bios**\r\n\r\nAleksey Urmanov is a research scientist at Sun Microsystems. He earned his doctoral degree in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee in 2002. Dr. Urmanov's research activities are centered around his interest in pattern recognition, statistical learning theory and ill-posed problems in engineering. His most recent activities at Sun focus on developing health monitoring and prognostics methods for EP-enabled computer servers. He is a founder and an Editor of the Journal of Pattern Recognition Research.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnton Bougaev holds a M.S. and a Ph.D. degrees in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue University. Before joining Sun Microsystems Inc. in 2007, he was a lecturer in Nuclear Engineering Department and a member of Applied Intelligent Systems Laboratory (AISL), of Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA. Dr. Bougaev is a founder and the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Pattern Recognition Research. His current focus is in reliability physics with emphasis on complex system analysis and the physics of failures which are based on the data driven pattern recognition techniques. ",
