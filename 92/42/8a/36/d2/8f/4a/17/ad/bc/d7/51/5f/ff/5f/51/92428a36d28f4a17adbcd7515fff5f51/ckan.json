    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is a growing need to develop improved technologies for precise airborne measurements of carbon dioxide, CO2.  CO2 measurements are of great importance to many areas of research, including climate change, global carbon budgets, and geological research in relation to volcanic activity.  At the same time, we are entering a period of time in which Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are becoming more widely used for atmospheric research.  UAS platforms have already proven themselves as a uniquely capable means for making measurements in remote areas and over oceans.  However, existing CO2 measurement technologies are difficult to adapt to or use in the UAS world.  This proposal describes a simple and inexpensive sensor for the precise determination of atmospheric CO2 that will be small enough for flight on small UAS platforms and sounding balloons.\r\nPhase I will include the fabrication of a proof-of-concept sensor system, laboratory characterization of the sensor, and culminate in a demonstration of the sensor on a UAS.  Phase II will emphasize improving the basic manufacturability of the design, as well as much more extensive laboratory and UAS testing.\r\n",
