  "notes": "Coastal Sediment Management Workgroup (CSMW) efforts are primarily coordinated through development of the California Sediment Master Plan (SMP), which lays out a number of objectives, goals and tasks to implement Regional Sediment Management (RSM) throughout coastal California. A fundamental principle of RSM is the application and placement of sediment within a regional area of the coast to address problems such as eroding beaches. Consequently, the CSMW has determined that the SMP effort needs to identify Beach Erosion Concern Areas (BECAs) where current or historical erosion is of concern to state, federal or local entities, or CSMW members. The list is periodically updated with information from completed Coastal RSM Plans; listing source specifies entities identifying the concern.",
