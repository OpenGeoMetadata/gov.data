    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Corrosion is an extensive problem that impacts National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and&amp;nbsp;Department of Defense (DoD).&amp;nbsp; The deleterious effects of corrosion result in steep costs, asset down-time affecting mission readiness, and safety risks to personnel.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, it is vital to reduce corrosion costs and risks in a sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA and DoD&amp;nbsp;have numerous structures and equipment that are fabricated from stainless steel.&amp;nbsp; The standard practice for protection of stainless steel is a process called passivation which removes free iron contamination from the surface and forms a&amp;nbsp;metal oxide layer to prevent corrosion.&amp;nbsp; Typical passivation procedures call for the use of nitric acid which exhibits excellent corrosion performance; however, there are a number of environmental, worker safety, and operational issues associated with its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longtime military specification (QQ-P-35C) for the passivation of stainless steel was cancelled in favor of newer specifications which allow for the use of citric acid in place of nitric acid.&amp;nbsp; Citric acid offers a variety of benefits that include increased safety for personnel, reduced environmental impact, and reduced operational cost.&amp;nbsp; There have been few studies, however, to determine whether citric acid is an acceptable alternative for NASA and DoD applications; therefore, NASA and DoD&amp;nbsp;agreed to collaborate on an effort to validate citric acid as an acceptable passivating agent for stainless steel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
