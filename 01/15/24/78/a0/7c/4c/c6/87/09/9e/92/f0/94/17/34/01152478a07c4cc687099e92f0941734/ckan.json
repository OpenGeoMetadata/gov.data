  "notes": "The Little Blackwater River drains a catchment area of approximately 11,229 hectares (27,748 acres). About 516 hectares (1,276 acres) in this watershed are currently developed for residential, commercial, and light industrial land use, while the remaining 10,713 hectares (26,472 acres) comprise a rural agricultural landscape, consisting of cropland, woodland, forested and marshy riparian areas, and tidal wetlands. The land surface is level, with frequent flooding due to poor drainage, low flow gradients, high water tables, and hydric soils. In recent years there has been extreme pressure to develop the Little Blackwater watershed. The City of Cambridge and Dorchester County are considering zoning and permitting of nearly 3,238 hectares (8,000 acres) for development in the next few years. The Little Blackwater River drains directly into the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1933 as a refuge for migratory waterfowl. The refuge includes more than 11,331 hectares (28,000 acres), composed mainly of rich tidal marsh characterized by fluctuating water levels and variable salinity. Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is one of the chief wintering areas for Canada geese using the Atlantic Flyway. Geese number approximately 35,000 and ducks exceed 15,000 at the peak of fall migration, usually in November. Urbanization of the Little Blackwater River could have an effect on water and sediment quality and may adversely affect fish and wildlife resources on Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. We used the sediment Quality Triad approach to evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed development. The Sediment Quality Triad is a weight of evidence approach consisting of synoptically collected measures of sediment chemistry, benthic/fish community structure, and sediment toxicity. The study area included three sites upstream of the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge on the Little Blackwater River, three samples downstream on the Refuge and a reference site on Buttons Creek, an adjacent watershed that is comprised almost entirely of undeveloped forest and marsh. In general, the Little Blackwater River watershed has had little impact from the contaminants evaluated in this study. Although the benthic community in this watershed is depressed, it is more likely a function of the physical characteristics of the shallow water system rather than an effect of contaminants. In 2004, proposals were made to Dorchester County for the development of two separate parcels of approximately 1,000 acres each within the Little Blackwater watershed. Nearly 4,500 homes and a golf course were planned for a 1,100-acre site along the north tributary, and a mixed-use industrial park was proposed near the east tributary southeast of Cambridge. By 2007, most of the plans were either scaled back or abandoned. Because developmental pressures on this watershed were greatly diminished in 2006, the second year data was similar to the first, making this report a baseline study rather than a comparison of pre and post construction effects.",
