    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There are significant logistical barriers to entry-level high performance computing (HPC) modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) users. Performing large-scale, massively parallel computations on modern supercomputing platforms is a very challenging task in and of itself. It requires huge amounts of analyst resources to construct datasets, transfer files, build codes, submit and monitor jobs, and analyze and archive results. This workflow requires significant attention to detail, and it is easy to miss steps, set up incorrect file or directory structures for datasets, spend inordinate effort to understand each computing platform and its unique job submission requirements, and decide how and where to archive potentially terabytes of simulation results. Collaboration among engineers is hampered by non-centralized storage of results, permission issues, and the sheer size of simulation result sets. Even for seasoned, veteran HPC users, the complexity of the overall HPC use process can be a barrier to daily use. \r\n\r\nWe propose a system to streamline this workflow, provide audit trails for data used in simulations, code versions used, and storage locations of results, as well as integrating tools for file transfer, job submission, batch visualization, and other tasks that require engineer's time that is better spent considering the simulation itself. Further, the proposed SLMIR application (Simulation Lifecycle Management &amp;#150; IllinoisRocstar) sets up the infrastructure for collecting simulation data across an organization or organizations, so that engineers and scientists may discover information generated by others in their research areas, potentially saving time and money by leveraging previous work and avoiding duplication. The envisioned system targets users of HPC tools in the field, rather than developers writing those tools, since engineers and scientists in manufacturing and engineering industries are heavily invested in the results of using the tools.",
