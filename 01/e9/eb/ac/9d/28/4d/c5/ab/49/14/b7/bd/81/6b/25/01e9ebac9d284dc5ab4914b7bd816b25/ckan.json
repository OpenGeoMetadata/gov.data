  "notes": "National Estuarine Research Reserve System The National Estuarine Research Reserve System was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (as amended) and is a network of protected areas established for long-term research, education and stewardship. This partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states protects more than one million acres of estuarine land and water, which provides essential habitat for wildlife; offers educational opportunities for students, teachers and the public; and serves as living laboratories for scientists. NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners. NERR System Wide Monitoring Project (SWMP) The National Estuarine Research Reserve System-wide Monitoring Program tracks short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine waters to understand how human activities and natural events can change ecosystems. It provides valuable long-term data on water quality, water nutrient levels, and weather at frequent time intervals. Coastal managers use this monitoring data to make informed decisions on local and regional issues, such as no-discharge zones for boats and measuring the success of restoration projects. The reserve system currently measures physical and chemical water quality indicators, nutrients and the impacts of weather on estuaries. As the program expands, plans include adding a biological monitoring component and tracking changes in land use through remote sensing. North Inlet  Winyah Bay Reserves Water Nutrient Monitoring Program The North Inlet Estuary and the adjacent lower northeastern section of Winyah Bay Estuary were designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1992. The North Inlet - Winyah Bay (NIW) Reserve is managed/hosted by the University of South Carolina, Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory. Its environmental monitoring program began running under the auspices of the NERR program in June 1993. In 1995, the NERR program began a System-Wide Monitoring Program that set protocols for monitoring the estuarine environment, starting with water quality. Official SWMP water nutrient protocols were implemented 2002 (meteorological protocols were implemented in 2001). As a result, the 1993-2001 dataset was collected under NERR auspices, but is not considered official SWMP data. Water nutrient data collected under the NERR program are a continuation of the Baruch Institutes long-term surface water nutrient, suspended sediment and Chlorophyll a data set, which began in 1978. Both Baruchs 19932001 data set, and Baruchs version of the NIW NERR 2002-2004 data set, contain additional parameters not required by SWMP protocols or reported by the NERR Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO) in their version of the database. Thirteen 1000 ml (one Liter) water samples were collected from four sites within the North Inlet and Winyah Bay Estuaries every 20 days, at 2 hour and 4 minute intervals, for 2 complete tidal cycles (26 hours). Samples were obtained with an ISCO automated water sampler at a depth of 0.5 meters below the waters surface. Starting on 4/17/2002, two additional grab samples were collected at two minute intervals after the final core database sample (#13), during slack low tide. These grab samples, in addition to sample #13, comprise the pseudo triplicates in the grab sample ancillary database. All water samples were brought into the lab and analyzed for salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, nitrate-nitrite, and nitrite (beginning 3/22/2003)), phosphorus (total whole and dissolved, ortho phosphate), dissolved organic carbon, and suspended solids (total, inorganic, and organic). Tide stage, based on published NOAA tide charts, was also included in the database for each sample. Suspended sediment color was noted and included in the SEDCOLOR ancillary database. Three of the four sample sites are located in salt marsh tidal creeks in the North Inlet Estuary. Samples were collected at the end of the Oyster Landing dock (OL) in Crab Haul Creek, the upper reaches of Debidue Creek (DC) near the boundary between Hobcaw Barony and the DeBordieu Colony, and at Clambank Landing Dock (CB) in Clambank Creek. These sites have similar tidal cycles and samples are collected approximately simultaneously. The fourth site is adjacent to Winyah Bay and its tidal cycle, as well as sample collection, is delayed 1 hour and 30 minutes. Samples are taken near the mouth of a small tidal creek that connects the Thousand Acre (TA) Marsh to Winyah Bay. All samples were collected at the same tide stage, although the TA sample times differ. For more information on the sample site, see the Description of Geographic Extent section.",
