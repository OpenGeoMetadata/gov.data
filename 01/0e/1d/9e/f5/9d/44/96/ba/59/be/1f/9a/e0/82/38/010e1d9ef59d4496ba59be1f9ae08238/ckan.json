  "notes": "The Metropolitan Area Integrated Land Use/Cover file serves as a navigation and reference tool for the LMIC Environmental Atlas and AtlasGDS desktop GIS products. It combines the 1997 Generalized Land Use data set produced by the Metropolitan Council with additional land cover classifications. The 1997 Generalized Land Use data set areas defined as 'vacant/agricutural' or 'parks and recreation areas' were integrated with natural resource features such as wetlands and forest cover from other data sets. Some ownership information was also added. The data set is in EPPL7 raster format, with a 30-meter grid cell size. The original 1997 Generalized Land Use data set encompasses the seven county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. The data set was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The data were interpreted from 1997 air photos and include the generalized land use classes of: single family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, public and semi-public, airports, parks and recreation, vacant and agricultural, major four lane highways, open water bodies, farmsteads, extractive, public industrial, industrial parks not developed, and public and semi-public not developed.",
