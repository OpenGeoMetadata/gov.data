    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Top-of-the-canopy broadband albedo and radiation fluxes are calculated from measurements at the Mongu and Skukuza flux tower sites in southern Africa from March 2000 through December 2002. Data were collected by instrumentation deployed at the top of the 30 m tower in the Kataba Local Forest near Mongu, Zambia, and atop the 20 m tower at the Skukuza tower site in Kruger National Park, South Africa.  At the Mongu site, Kipp and Zonen albedometers housing both upward- and downward-looking pyranometers were outfitted with clear and red domes to collect broadband albedo and radiation fluxes in the shortwave (SW) and near-infrared  (NIR) wavebands, respectively. The data are mean values provided at 15-minute intervals for 2000-2002. At the Skukuza tower, Kipp and Zonen albedometers (also outfitted with clear and red domes) collected broadband albedo and radiation fluxes in the SW and NIR wavebands. In addition, a pyrgeometer was used to collect longwave radiation flux in thermal infrared (TIR) wavebands. The data at Skukuza are mean values provided at 30-minute intervals for 2000-2002, except for the TIR data, which are provided for 2001 and 2002 only. For both sites, photosynthetically active radiation can be calculated from measurements.The data are provided in comma-delimited ASCII files, with column headers. The SW and NIR data for both sites are provided in one file per year per site for 2000-2002. The Skukuza longwave data are provided separately, and for years 2001 and 2002 only.",
