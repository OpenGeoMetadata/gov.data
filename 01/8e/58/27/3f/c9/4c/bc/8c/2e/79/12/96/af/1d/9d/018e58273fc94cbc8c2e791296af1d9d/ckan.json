  "notes": "As used in this assessment, \"fire weather\" is analogous to \"extreme fire weather potential\" used by Schmidt et al. (2002). The 3 main components of fire weather include temperature, humidity, and wind. We used average maximum temperature and average humidity (vapor pressure) for the month of August from DAYMET (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/); and average surface wind speed for August from the ICBEMP (www.icbemp.gov). These data were 1000-m and 9317-m resolution, respectively. We \"smoothed\" the wind data by resampling it to 1000-m resolution so that it would have a similar resolution as the temperature and humidity data. A proxy for fire weather was then generated spatially by averaging the standardized values for the 3 weather variables: Wx_potential = (max_temp + (1- rel_humidity) + rel_wind_ros) / 3",
