    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The intent of this proposal is to develop key building block technology for lightweight composite structures suitable for cryogenic fuel depot storage as well as human in-space habitat.    The effort will incorporate and expand on previous work by the participants in the cryogenic performance of composite materials as well as improved impact technologies for micro-meteor/space debris survivability.  It will then develop radiation resistant capabilities. \r\n\r\nIn order to develop reliable composite structures for use as cryogenic fuel storage, human habitation, or other mission critical application a solid understanding of constituent material environmental capabilities is required.  While good progress has been made in expanding the knowledge of how composite fibers and matrix systems (resins) react to loads and strains at extremely cold temperatures little to no effort has been made to incorporate radiation exposure such as would be encountered with in-space fuel storage depots.  \r\n\r\nWith a view to developing dual-use lightweight composite structures the proposed effort will develop improved composite material resistance to the harsh radiation environment a spacecraft would be expected to encounter during the life of its mission.  Our intent is to develop robust light weight composite structures which are cryogenic capable as well as impact and radiation resistant.\r\n",
