  "notes": "This personal geodatabase contains raster images of chlorophyll concentrations in the Gulf of Maine. These raster images are seasonal composites, and were calculated as means or as medians. The seasons were defined as the following: 1) Fall= September, October, November; 2) Winter= December, January, February; 3) Spring= March, April, May; 4) Summer= June, July, August. For example, June '98, July '98, August '98 = Chlorophyll Summer '98. These images were also reprocessed to remove land and no data values (value = 252 and value = 0, 253, 251 respectively), as well as to calculate the real world values for chlorophyll in micrograms per liter.",
