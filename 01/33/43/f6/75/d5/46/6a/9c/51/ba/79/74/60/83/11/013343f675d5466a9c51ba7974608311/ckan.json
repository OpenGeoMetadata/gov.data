  "notes": "In October of 1981, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Service sent out a questionnaire to all field stations. The stations were requested to identify all field station threats and conflicts. All Service field stations reported threats and conflicts of various levels of occurrence and magnitude. These reports were summarized in a July 1983 Report of Resource Problems on the national wildlife refuges, national fish hatcheries and research centers. Twentyseven resource problems were identified at Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge. This comprehensive plan addresses current and planned actions to correct these problems by the staff of the Trempealeau Refuge. Funding from the Accelerated Refuge Maintenance Management ARRM Program and Service Construction funds have made some progress possible in dealing with the resource problems identified. Other funding proposals are being considered at this time as described later in this report. The 5,617acre Trempealeau NWR is located in southwestern Trempealeau and southeastern Buffalo counties in Wisconsin. Strategically located within the Mississippi River valley, the refuge is an important resting place for migrant waterfowl passing through in spring and fall. A major portion of the Trempealeau NWR was recently added in 1979 with  acquisition of the 4,900acre former Delta Fish and Fur Farm. Knowing that this property would probably be sold to the government, the former owners performed only a minimum level of maintenance to roads, dikes, and water control facilities. Many of the problems identified in this report were thus inherited with acquisition.",
