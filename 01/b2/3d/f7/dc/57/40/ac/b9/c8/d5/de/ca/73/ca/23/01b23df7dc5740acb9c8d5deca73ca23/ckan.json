  "notes": "Flood Control, Bank Stabilization and development of a navigational channel on the Missouri River had a great impact on the river and adjacent lands. The new channelized river was 18 miles shorter, resulting in the loss of thousands of acres of backwater wetlands, sandbars and islands. The new channel was designed to be straighter, deeper and faster flowing than the braided channel that characterized the original river. The shortened re-aligned river alignment did not respect private ownership or state lines in either Nebraska or Iowa. Private landowners were paid for land that was ultimately converted from cropland to river channel, with no differentiation from state to state. Both Eastern and Western Water Law applies to that land that lies between the ordinary high water line (OHWL) and the applicable state line (SL). In Iowa, Eastern Water Law applies, stating that land lying beneath the water in the original channel, and between the OHWL and the SL belongs to the state of Iowa. Land thus claimed is referred to as Sovereign land. In Nebraska, Western Water Law applies, stating that land lying beneath the water in the original channel, and between the SL and the OHWL belongs to the adjacent landowner. Realizing that the channel realignment and the SL created a problem, the states of Iowa and Nebraska negotiated what is referred to as the 1943 Compact Line, which created the current legal state line. The compromise used the center of the 1940 stabilized channel as a basis. Under the compromise agreement, land was ceded back and forth across the channel to establish the state line as illustrated by this shapefile. The supporting data for this new state line a series of river surveys the Iowa Conservation Commission (ICC) contracted with Virtue Engineering to certify in the 1980's. The original survey work was done by Larry Hart during the 1950's. The (ICC) Missouri River surveys are probably the best surveyed documentation of the 1943 Compact line. Where river oxbows or segments of channels were involved, each state would receive Å¤ of the original channel, or 500 feet from the newly established 1943 Compact Line (SL). Two Relavent documents are: Instructions to county Surveyors, and Nebraska vs Iowa, 406 U.S. 117 (1972) that seems to clarify and support the original 1943 Compact Agreement.",
