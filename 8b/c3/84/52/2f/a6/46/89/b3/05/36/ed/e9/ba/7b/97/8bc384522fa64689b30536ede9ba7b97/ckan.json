    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Integrated circuits in NASA spacecraft and Robotic Exploration Technologies that enable exploration of the solar system planets, moons and small bodies must operate over large temperature extremes and mitigate radiation effects that can result in upset or destruction of devices. Development of a reliable, high-performance nonvolatile memory (NVM) is critical to successful NASA explorations and development of robotic exploration technologies designed to operate in the extreme temperature, pressure and radiation environments of planetary and lunar surfaces. PrivaTran has previously demonstrated an electronically-programmable resistor as a NVM element. Initial static data retention testing has shown tolerance to several radiation types and high thermal stress, thereby demonstrating the potential for use in radiation-hardened circuits for extreme environments. Device materials and fabrication processes are compatible with high-temperature semiconductor manufacturing platforms utilizing wide-bandgap semiconductor materials. The PrivaTran NVM device uses standard materials as the active switching medium and device electrodes can be formed either in the substrate material or within the interconnect layers of the integrated circuit (IC). As a result, NVM arrays can be integrated with wide-band-gap semiconductor materials in a three-dimensional (3D) architecture, resulting in a high-density memory with superior NVM performance and significant savings in size, weight, power and cost.",
