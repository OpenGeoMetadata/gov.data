  "notes": "We provide several aspects of Common Loon life history that were previously undescribed. From 1989-98, information was collected from 1,165 uniquely marked loons followed for 1-10 years at eight geographically distinct sites. Reproductive success (fledged young per territorial pair) at four sires ranged from 0.51 to 0.84, indicating breeding populations within the study were relatively stable. Territorial fidelity of adults ranged from 66-86% among sites with a mean of 81%. Territory fidelity was highest in whole lake territories (84%) and lowest in partial lake territories (72%). Male loons defending multiple lake territories had significantly less territory fidelity (71 %) than females (81 %). Of the marked adults not returning to their previous years' territory, 12% changed territories within 12 km of their previous territory, 3-4% did not establish a territory for 1-4 years, and 3-4% were not relocated and represent the maximum annual mortality rate of the established breeding adults. The mean rate of mate switching was 19% per year and was similar among males and females. Most mate switching occurred at two periods during the breeding cycle (between ice-off and first nesting and again within one week following a nest failure. The estimated survival rate of adults banded as juveniles (ABJs) at three years ranged from 17- 25% for three study sites. Of these returning ABJs, breeding territories were established 1-64 km from their natal lake. First year breeding ages ranged from 5-11 years with a mean of 7 years. A total of 35 loons banded in the Upper Great Lakes were recovered outside their breeding area. Of these, 24 were relocated during the winter along Florida's Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic Coast of Florida to North Carolina. Seven one-year olds were relocated summering from the Gulf Coast north along the mid-Atlantic Coast to New Jersey. Continued monitoring of the color-marked individuals will provide information on lifetime reproductive success. New innovative techniques that also require loons in-hand, such as satellite telemetry, isotope tracing, and genetic diversity, will further define the life history of the loon's Great Lakes breeding population so current and future conservation measures can be implemented based on site-specific knowledge.",
