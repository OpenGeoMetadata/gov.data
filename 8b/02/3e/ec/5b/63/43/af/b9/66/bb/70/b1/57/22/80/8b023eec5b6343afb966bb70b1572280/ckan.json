  "notes": "The White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) is a colonial waterbird that breeds in western North America and southern South America (Ryder 1967). Within North  America, large numbers are found along the Texas and Louisiana coasts and in the Great Basin states of Nevada and Utah, with peripheral but growing colonies in Oregon, Idaho, and California (Ryder and Manry 1994). In addition, small numbers nest sporadically in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North and South Dakota, southern Alberta, Iowa, and Oklahoma (Ryder and Manry 1994, Ivey et al. in prep). White-faced Ibis breeding in the Great Basin and surrounding area (designated as the Great Basin population) are recognized as a Species of Management Concern (USFWS 1995a) because of the small population size, limited number of traditional breeding sites, and vulnerability to habitat loss. The Great Basin White-faced Ibis population averaged 26,000 breeding pairs from 1997 to 1999 (Ivey et al. in prep}, which is triple the 1984 estimate of 7,500 breeding pairs (Sharp 1985). Although the population has grown substantially over the last two decades, the ability to predict future population trends is limited because many aspects of their breeding ecology and  population dynamics are unknown. Wetland communities within the Great Basin undergo changes within and among seasons due to water level fluctuations that vary in magnitude, timing, frequency, and duration (Jehl 1994, Earnst et al. 1998, Warnock et al. 1998). Whitefaced Ibis exploit unpredictable habitat conditions by relocating within and between watersheds when local breeding habitat conditions deteriorate (Ryder 1967, Sharp 1985, Ivey et al. 1988, Henny and Herron 1989, Earnst et al. 1998). This nomadic breeding strategy may promote population stability and growth if alternative wetland breeding  sites are available (Vance 1980, Den Boer 1981, Bessenger 1986, Benetts and Kitchens 1997). The availability of refugia is especially critical when droughts and floods render traditional breeding sites unsuitable for nesting (Earnst et al. 1998). Traditional breeding sites such as the Lower Carson River Basin in northwest Nevada, Malheur NWR in southeast Oregon, and Great Salt Lake in northern Utah, annually support the largest breeding concentrations of White-faced Ibis in the Great Basin (Ryder and Manry 1994). The nomadic nature of White-faced Ibis and their dependence on ephemeral wetlands in the Great Basin requires a regional approach to management (Earnst et al. 1998, Ivey et al. in prep}. Local wetland management strategies should reflect the overall needs of the White-faced Ibis population through a regionally coordinated decision making process. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is currently  developing management guidelines with the primary goal of maintaining a stable or increasing White-faced Ibis population in the Great Basin and surrounding areas (Ivey et al. in prep}. However, this goal is not yet attainable because information on breeding habitat selection, reproductive success, and demographic responses to unpredictable habitat conditions are severely limited.  The objective of this study was to evaluate breeding habitat selection, nesting  ecology, nestling survivorship, and population dynamics of White-faced Ibis at one of the major and persistent breeding sites in the Great Basin, the Lower Carson River Basin, Nevada. I also identified the migratory and wintering destinations of Whitefaced Ibis breeding in the northwest Great Basin through the usage of a large-scale color I marking and resighting program. Information from this study will be of assistance in the development of wetland management strategies in the Lower Carson River Basin. This is important for regional conservation actions because management decisions at major and persistent breeding sites will affect regional population trends.",
