  "notes": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected\n          geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing\n          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is\n          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The Topological Faces / Area Landmark Relationship\n          File (FACESAL.dbf) contains a record for each face / area landmark relationship.  Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB.\n          A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the\n          area of the face.  The face to which a record in the Topological Faces / Area Landmark Relationship File (FACESAL.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to\n          the Topological Faces Shapefile (FACES.shp) on the permanent topological face identifier (TFID) attribute.  The area landmark to which a record in the\n          Topological Faces / Area Landmark Relationship File (FACESAL.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to the Area Landmark Shapefile (AREALM.shp) on the area\n          landmark identifier (AREAID) attribute.  A face may be part of multiple area landmarks.  An area landmark may consist of multiple faces.",
