    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is significant need for arrays of miniature sensors that are completely wireless.  Ideally these sensors would be built as an integrated device, including sensing elements, computation/signal conditioning, communication, and an on-board power supply.  However, they have not been developed due to the difficulty with integrating sensing ele-ments, and the absence of miniature power supplies.  The purpose of this Phase I program is to address these two issues, and make viable, wireless, miniature sensors. Bipolar Technologies has pioneered the development of micro-scopic rechargeable batteries, built with IC processes, for direct integration into microcircuits.  When combined with miniature energy scavengers, a hybrid power supply can be created, to provide autonomy for wireless sensors.  During Phase I, the concept of using a miniature hybrid power supply will be demonstrated with arrays of prototype sensors, built with commercial off-the-shelf components.  Microscopic, microfabricated lithium polymer batteries will be engineered, fabricated and used as part of the hybrid power supply.  Phase II will be used to refine the micro-fabrication processes used to make batteries and sensors, so that completely integrated multisensors can be delivered to and used by NASA.  This micropower supply will enable a new class of completely wireless sensors.",
