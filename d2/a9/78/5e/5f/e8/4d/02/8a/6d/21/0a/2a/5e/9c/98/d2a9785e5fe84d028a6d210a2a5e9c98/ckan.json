  "notes": "Summer Steelhead Distribution October 2009 Version This dataset depicts observation-based stream-level geographic distribution of anadromous summer-run steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus (O. mykiss), in California. It was developed for the express purpose of assisting with steelhead recovery planning efforts. The distributions reported in this dataset were derived from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate distribution is available for winter-run steelhead. Contact information is the same as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream segments. These lines are developed by \"tracing down\" from each observation to the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present). The end result (i.e., this layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions, and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation as indicated by the 'Lat",
