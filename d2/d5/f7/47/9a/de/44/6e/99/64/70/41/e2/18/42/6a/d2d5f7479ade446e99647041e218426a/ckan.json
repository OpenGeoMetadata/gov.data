    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;It is critical that safety factors be maximized with respect to long duration, extraterrestrial space flight. Any significant improvement in radiation protection will be critical in ensuring the safety of crew and hardware on such missions. The project goal was to study novel concepts for radiation shielding materials that can be used for long-duration space missions. As part of this project we investigated the use of thin films for the evaluation of a containment system that could retain liquid hydrogen and provide the necessary hydrogen density for effective shielding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical challenge of this project was to identify or design/develop a polymeric/composite material, laminate system that can contain a large quantity of liquid hydrogen in deep space for Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) shielding. This material/system must be strong enough to handle the pressure generated by this cryogenic material, yet maintain some degree of elasticity, even at liquid hydrogen temperatures (typically 20&amp;nbsp;K). It must be thin enough to minimize secondary particles from GCR, yet not allow the hydrogen to diffuse through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it would be desirable to have high emissivity at long wavelengths so that radiative cooling can occur. Specific architectural&amp;nbsp;designs and thermal controls of hydrogen contaminant system were not addressed in this project.&amp;nbsp; This project also aligns with joint activities currently being worked with other NASA centers and the integration of technologies that are considered necessary for future exploration.&lt;/p&gt;",
