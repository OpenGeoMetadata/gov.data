  "notes": "Only recently has information become available concerning the abundance of nonindigenous species in Hawaiian waters. Maciolek (1984) listed 19 species of diadromous and marine fishes to be present in Hawaiian waters, which was increased to 21 marine species by Randall (1987), about 4% of a total of 536 Hawaiian shore fish species (Randall 1992). Carlton and Eldredge (in prep.) reviewed the marine and brackish water invertebrates of Hawaiói and determined approximately 205 species to be demonstrably or potentially nonindigenous, again about 4% of the approximate 5000 marine species estimated for Hawaiói (Allison et al. 1995). Approximately 18 species of macroalgae have been introduced to Hawaiói since 1950 (Russell 1992, Rogers 1997, 1999), again about 4% of the approximately 430 estimated total macroalgal species for Hawaiói (G. Smith, pers. comm.). Baseline studies of Hawaiian nearshore marine biota directed toward the detection of introduced species and their impact have shown that nonindigenous introductions vary substantially from these average values, depending on the characteristics of the area surveyed. The most comprehensive survey conducted to date, a 1996 survey completed in Pearl Harbor (Coles et al. 1997; 1999), found 95 known or potentially nonindigenous species, which composed 23% of the 419 invertebrates, macroalgae, and fishes found. Only three nonindigenous invertebrates and one nonidigenous fish occurred at Midway Atoll in 1997 out of a total 444 taxa found (DeFelice et al. 1998). No nonindigenous algae or invertebrates were found in the nearshore and intertidal of Kahoóolawe Island in 1998 out of a total of 298 species observed or collected (Coles et al. 1998). Despite the potential importance of Honolulu Harbor or other commercial harbors on Oahu as potential gateways for nonindigenous marine species to enter the Hawaiian marine ecosystem, no studies have previously been conducted of introduced species in Hawaiian commercial harbors, and little information is available for the composition of the marine communities for these harbors. Therefore, surveys were conducted in Honolulu Harbor and Keehi Lagoon in 1997, and in Kewalo Basin, the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor and the Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor in 1998. The results of this study are reported herein and the presence and impact of nonindigenous marine introductions in these harbors are evaluated",
