  "notes": "Hudson River Estuary Shallow Water Surveys. Subbottom data was collected November 5 to December 15, 2009, in the estuary north from Saugerties to Troy. Data Collection and Processing: Subbottom Data - Fugro utilized the EdgeTech SB216 Chirp subbottom profiler system for seismic data collection. This system was operated using a swept frequency range of 2-16 KHz, maximizing subsurface resolution within the very shallow near-surface material (1- 5 m beneath seafloor). Subbottom data was processed and interpreted using Discover and SMT Kingdom software. The intent of the processing was to provide the NYSDEC with SEG-Y files that were properly filtered and spatially oriented to allow for near-surface interpretation of sediments in the Hudson River. Processing steps for the subbottom data included swell filtering to compensate for sea conditions during survey operations, compiling correct shotpoint navigation, and adjusting data gains for optimal interpretation. An isopach (sediment thickness) of the unconsolidated surficial sediments was created from the seafloor and mapped sediment horizon base using an acoustic two-way travel time of 1500 meters/second. Subbottom data was used to assist in selecting sediment sampling locations. Graphical sub-bottom profiles for areas of interest were produced and descriptive results will be included in the final report. Points were created every 300th shot (approximately 100 meters).",
