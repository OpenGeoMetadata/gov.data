    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "ELORET Corporation, in collaboration with the Space Systems Design Laboratory of Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes developing and demonstrating a capability/technology to de-orbit small payloads (approximately 1 kg) from Low-Earth Orbit and returning them to Earth safely. To achieve this goal, the current proposal has five objectives and associated tasks:\r\n1.\tSurveying the Bio-science communities to define requirements for the first generation mission architecture.\r\n2.\tUnderstanding the launch interface requirements such as mass, volume, vibro-acoustic loads, electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc.\r\n3.\tDesigning and developing the first generation of mission architectures including the key aspects of launch, in-space operation, entry trajectory analysis (EDL sequence), and landing/recovery. \r\n4.\tUnderstanding and quantifying small spacecraft requirements for power, thermal control, communications, propulsion, etc., and developing the preliminary design of the spacecraft system using off the shelf technologies whenever possible.\r\n5.\tDesigning and developing a passive (i.e., without any chemical or aerodynamic deceleration devices), single-stage ballistic entry system (including the aeroshell).\r\n6.\tDesigning and developing the impact energy absorption system and thermal control system required for payload thermal management and survivability upon landing. \r\n",
