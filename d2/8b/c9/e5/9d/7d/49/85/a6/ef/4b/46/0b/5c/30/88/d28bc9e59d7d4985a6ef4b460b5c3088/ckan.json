  "notes": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) Test Facility Instrumentation Suite (GPSIS) provides great flexibility in testing receivers by providing operational control of dynamic and repeatable scenarios in a low cost laboratory environment. The GPSIS is capable of simulating external sensors and aiding input data, thereby emulating a host vehicle integration. Control of each SV&amp;rsquo;s 50 bps down link data and specific data set definition for ephemeris, almanac, atmospheric modeling, UTC to GPS time parameters is also available. Sensor data is presented on interfaces coincident with GPS RF signals. This allows us to &amp;lsquo;drive&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;fly&amp;rsquo; the GPS receiver in the convenience and comfort of the laboratory, thereby reducing costly dynamic testing. Simulations are replayed exactly and as many times as necessary, with controlled variability to exercise intricacies in receiver design, or to exploit receiver anomalies and performance issues.&amp;nbsp;The GPSIS system also provides integrated control for Electronic Warfare (EW) and multipath signals that are modeled through computer control. The simulated GPS signals are injected directly into a GPS receiver under test in the laboratory. Fort Huachuca&amp;rsquo;s 80,000 acres of test range allows us to conduct testing in a variety of real world environments to include desert, canyon and mountainous terrain, with or without foliage. A post- wide trunking system is available with DES secure communications. We are also able to provide differential GPS corrections for the entire test range and beyond, providing position accuracies in the sub-meter range, as well as producing truth data during test.  ",
