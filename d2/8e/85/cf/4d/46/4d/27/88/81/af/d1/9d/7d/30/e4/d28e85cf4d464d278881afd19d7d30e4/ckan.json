  "notes": "The Eco-regional Biodiversity Monitoring (EBM) project is a long-term, large-scale monitoring program to inventory, monitor, and assess priority species and natural communities. Our goal is not only to identify species and habitats of greatest conservation need, but also to produce scientifically sound and quantitative data that can be used to inform land and wildlife management decisions. This project spans two CDFW regions and encompasses four eco-regions (Klamath, Cascades, northern Sierra Nevada, and the Modoc plateau) on an 18.7 million acre study area. The project has been funded by State Wildlife Grants since its inception in the North Central Region in 2009. EBM includes monitoring and data collection components for birds, vegetation, and mammals within each random survey plot. Trail cameras have a significant role in our mammal monitoring due to their cost-effectiveness and high detection rates.The camera data in this file was collected on National Forests and public Lands within CDFWâ€™s North Central Region and the Sierra Nevada eco-region from 2010-2011. Plots were randomly selected from 6 elevation strata above 3,000 feet, with one plot per FIA hexagon. Two camera stations were installed at each survey plot, the 1st camera at plot center, 2nd camera 500m in random direction for 2wo weeks from June-October. Stations were baited with oats, walnuts, jam, peanut butter, and apple mix. Camera stations were rebaited and batteries checked after one week.Camera stations were installed 1.5m from ground level facing bait . Camera and bait station were approximetely 6 - 8 feet apart. Each station had a unique code marking attached to the target tree within the camera view. Cameras were set to date and time-stamp all photos. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Datasets created as part of the same project include:Mammal Camera Detections (Hexagon) - Sierra Nevada Ecoregion - SMP/EBM [ds1061]Tree Monitoring - Sierra Nevada Ecoregion - SMP/EBM [ds1062]Tree Monitoring (Hexagon) - Sierra Nevada Ecoregion - SMP/EBM [ds1063]",
