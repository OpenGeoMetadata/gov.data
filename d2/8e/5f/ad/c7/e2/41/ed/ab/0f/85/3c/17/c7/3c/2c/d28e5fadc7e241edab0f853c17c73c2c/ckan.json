    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The goal of the rHEALTH sensor is to provide rapid, low-cost, handheld complete blood count (CBC), cell differential counts, electrolyte measurements, and other lab tests based on a reusable, flow-based microfluidic platform.  For Phase II, we will develop an rHEALTH prototype to be delivered to NASA for reusable CBC, cell differential counts, and electrolyte measurements.  Each subassembly and individual assay will be tested individually prior to full integration into the system level prototype.  The rHEALTH sensor is a compact, portable device that employs cutting-edge fluorescence detection optics, innovative microfluidics, and unique capabilities.  Based on its streamlined design, the rHEALTH sensor is able to perform a suite of different assays using a single drop of blood.  Furthermore, the entire system allows cost-effective operation because of its nanoliter operating volumes.  This is in contrast to existing point-of-care diagnostics devices such as the iSTAT and Piccolo systems which only perform one panel of assays per disposable reagent cartridge.   The result is a highly practical, cost-effective, and powerful sensor.  The successful completion of the Phase II program is a significant milestone for our rHEALTH sensor.  It means that we would have been successful in shrinking hospital-sized clinical laboratory into a portable device.  ",
