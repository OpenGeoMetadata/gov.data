  "notes": "This is a published report that contains a review of the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology's work relating to the Scott's Lake Site. Exploratory archeological investigations were conducted at the Scott's Lake Site (38CR1 - Ft. Watson State Historic Site) during the summer of 1972. The active field season extended from June 5, 1972through September 3, 1972. Field work was conducted by the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology of the University of South Carolina. The program was jointly sponsored by the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology, the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, and the South Carolina Department of Archives and History. A portion of the funding was provided through the. historic preservation grant program of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. The research program at Scott's Lake was exploratory in nature. That the site was the location of a British Revolutionary War fort and that it had been a prehis.toric Indian ceremonial center were known. Thegoal of this research was to determine the extent, nature and degree of preservation of the cultural remains. On the basis of this determination recommendations concerning research potential, interpretation, and preservation of the site were to be made.",
