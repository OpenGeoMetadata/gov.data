    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Sensors are vital components for control and advanced health management techniques. However, sensors continue to be considered the weak link in many engineering applications since often they are less reli- able than the system they are observing. This is in part due to the sensorsâ€™ operating principles and their susceptibility to interference from the environment. Detecting and mitigating sensor failure modes are becoming increasingly important in more complex and safety-critical applications. This paper reports on different techniques for sensor fault detection, disambiguation, and mitigation. It presents an expert system that uses a combination of object-oriented modeling, rules, and semantic networks to deal with the most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling, and dropout, as well as system faults. The paper also describes a sensor correction module that is based on fault parameters extraction (for bias, drift, and scaling fault modes) as well as utilizing partial redundancy for dropout sensor fault modes). The knowledge-based system was derived from the results obtained in a previously deployed Neural Network (NN) application for fault detection and disambiguation. Results are illustrated on an electromechanical actuator application where the system faults are jam and spalling. In addition to the functions implemented in the previous work, system fault detection under sensor failure was also modeled. The paper includes a sensitivity analysis that compares the results previously obtained with the NN. It concludes with a discussion of similarities and differences between the two approaches and how the knowledge based system provides additional functionality compared to the NN implementation.",
