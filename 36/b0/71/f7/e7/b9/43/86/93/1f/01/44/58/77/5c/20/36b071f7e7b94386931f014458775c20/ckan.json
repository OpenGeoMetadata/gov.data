    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed technology genetically labels intracellular structures and visualizes protein interactions in living cells using a compact, confocal microscope with solid-state laser illumination.  The proposed innovation will allow advanced study of cellular biology in microgravity environments.  The recently introduced reef coral proteins fluoresce over a broader range of wavelengths than GFP and its derivatives.  This allows simultaneous fluorescence labeling of three, and possibly four, cellular constituents simultaneously.  The proposed confocal microscope will be based entirely on compact, low-power solid-state laser technology and will allow high-resolution imaging of structures within living cells in three colors simultaneously at standard video frame rates.  As part of this innovation we will develop a 594 nm solid state laser for improved resolution of HcRed, the most red-shifted of the reef coral proteins.  In Phase I we will set up a biological model that incorporates three different protein fusions.  Phase I microscopy studies will determine the specifications for spectral and spatial resolution for the Phase II device.  That Phase II device will comprise a compact system that uses low-power solid-state laser illumination.  The device will have broad applicability for space cell biology research and also for terrestrial-based cell biology research.\r\n\r\n",
