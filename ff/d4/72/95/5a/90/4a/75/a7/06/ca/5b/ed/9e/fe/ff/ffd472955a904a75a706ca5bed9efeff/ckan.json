    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for reducing a traditional satellite to such a small size is to remove the maximum possible functionality that is not critical for creating a working spacecraft. This includes moving as much functionality as possible from the sensor node to a host system (e.g. mothership or ground station). This process is extremely critical of functions that consume mass, power, or volume such as attitude controllers, sophisticated sensing systems, and redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous methods for separating special from temporal evolution include formations of a few large spacecraft. MMS and STEREO are examples. These prior missions have the drawback of being very expensive and being limited to only a few spatial measurements at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this effort is to develop a concept for how to construct a spacecraft platform that will enable sensing systems to be reduced in size to a very small (~50cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), wireless package that can be utilized in distributed space sensing systems, particularly for in-situ measurements. The innovations that were explored include energy harvesting and management, GPS tracking, electronic integration and mechanical packaging.&lt;/p&gt;",
