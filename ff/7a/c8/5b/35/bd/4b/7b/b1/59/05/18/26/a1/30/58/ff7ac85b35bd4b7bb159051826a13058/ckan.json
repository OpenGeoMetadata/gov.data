    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A microgravity-compatible Brine Evaporation and Mineralization System (BEMS) is proposed for 100&#37; water recovery from highly contaminated wastewater as well as water generated from entrained organic contaminant oxidation without concern for precipitation of organic and inorganic solids.  The BEMS utilizes fully regenerable evaporation media, a catalytic oxidizer, and heat exchange technologies, which reduce Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for water recovery by eliminating the nominal brine byproduct, dramatically lowering consumables and reducing long-term waste storage requirements.  The BEMS process will exceed the goal of 95&#37; water recovery by 2017-2022 set forth by NASA in the space technology roadmap.  Highly contaminated wastewater streams such as urine, hygiene water, and RO brines are major wastewater streams for the BEMS.  The Phase I project will focus on development of the evaporation bed capacity and catalytic oxidizer efficiency.  The Phase II will incorporate thermal efficiency and introduce catalytic capability into the evaporation bed to improve efficiency and result in delivery of a prototype system.  These efforts will be the foundation for the design and construction of a flight ready prototype for use on the International Space Station.",
