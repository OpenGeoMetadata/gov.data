    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Instruments flown on board NASA missions often do not measure quantities\r\nof interest to scientists directly, but rather observable quantities. In addition,\r\ninstruments often introduce artifacts into the data and techniques are needed to\r\nremove them. In both cases, scientifically relevant information can be\r\ninferred by simulating a parameterized model and adjusting the parameters to\r\nbest match observed data. This minimization process of \"fitting\" a model to\r\ndata is computationally demanding, since it requires evaluating the often complex\r\nmodels many times and minimizing a function of many variables. Fast, more efficient\r\nfitting techniques are therefore required in order to fully harvest the scientific\r\noutput from NASA missions.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will develop a fast, general-purpose parameter fitting software\r\ntool suite taking advantage of inexpensive, high-performance graphics processing\r\nunits (GPUs). The goal of Phase I of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility\r\nof model fitting on GPUs.  We will therefore prototype forward models, relevant\r\nmathematical operators and the actual parameter adjustment algorithm on GPUs\r\nand compare their performance to a pure CPU implementation. We will particularly\r\nfocus on ease of use for the scientist to migrate their applications to this infrastructure. \r\nDuring Phase I, the TRL will increase from 3 to 4. \r\n\r\nIn the Phase II, we will then harden the prototypes developed in Phase I and provide alternative modeling algorithms to support a broader range of applications. In addition, we will work with scientists from various NASA missions, including the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III mission and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to accelerate their modeling needs. In addition to NASA missions, other federal or commercial applications\r\nrequiring to adjust model parameters to fit large sets of observed data will benefit from this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
