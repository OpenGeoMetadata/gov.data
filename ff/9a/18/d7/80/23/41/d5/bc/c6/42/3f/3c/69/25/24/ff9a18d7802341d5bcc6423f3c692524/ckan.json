    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Tree and liana (vine) measurements were collected in a logging concession at the Fazenda Rohsamar in the municipality of Jurena in northwestern Mato Grosso. Tree identification and diameter measurements were collected between July 31, 2003 and October 14, 2003 on 10-m x 1000-m transects and the liana measurements were collected between August 5, 2003 and October 14, 2003 on 10 2-m x 1000-m transects within a 1400 ha logging block ( Feldpauschh et al. 2006). Liana transects were nested within tree census transects to relate total species data to the tree inventory. The biomass of lianas was calculated using two different allometric equations derived for lianas in Amazonian forests ( Gerwing and Farias, 2000; Gerwing et al. 2004). Comma-separated data files of measurements of (1) tree species (diameter >10 cm), and forest characteristics, (2) measurements of liana diameter, forest characteristics, and calculated biomass, and (3) georeference points for the liana sampling transects are provided.Selective logging has become a dominant land-use in Brazilian Amazonia. Published data on forest biomass in southern Amazonia is sparse. As part of a larger study to evaluate the effect of reduced impact logging on carbon dynamics and nutrient stocks, forest structure, and forest regeneration potential, we conducted a pre-harvest campaign to estimate tree and liana biomass in a parcel of managed forest in northwestern Mato Grosso. Prior to logging in 2003, a scientific inventory was conducted in Block 5 of the logging concession(Figure 1). Tree characteristics for all trees and palms > 10 cm DBH was measured by stratified sampling across the block to account for differences in tree densities (trees/ha). Transects were located using a commercial timber inventory to identify tree trunks approximately 10 cm DBH, lower and upper canopy height, species, and location of all individuals to the nearest 10 cm on an x-y grid. Diameter of all liana stems were included if their ultimate rooting point before ascending into the canopy fell within the transect. Lianas that had been cut due to reduced impact logging practices were also measured. Distance along the transect was recorded for each stem.",
