  "notes": "This data set consists of digital polygons of constant recharge rates for the High Plains aquifer in Oklahoma. This area encompasses the panhandle counties of Cimarron, Texas, and Beaver, and the western counties of Harper, Ellis, Woodward, Dewey, and Roger Mills. The High Plains aquifer underlies approximately 7,000 square miles of Oklahoma and is used extensively for irrigation. The High Plains aquifer is a water-table aquifer and consists predominately of the Tertiary-age Ogallala Formation and overlying Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits. In some areas the aquifer is absent and the underlying Triassic, Jurassic, or Cretaceous-age rocks are exposed at the surface. These rocks are hydraulically connected with the aquifer in some areas. The High Plains aquifer is composed of interbedded sand, siltstone, clay, gravel, thin limestones, and caliche. The proportion of various lithological materials changes rapidly from place to place, but poorly sorted sand and gravel predominate. The rocks are poorly to moderately well cemented by calcium carbonate. The High Plains aquifer was divided into an east and west half with each half having an assigned recharge that was used as input to a ground-water flow model on the High Plains aquifer, during the calibration of the steady-state model. The east half was assigned a constant recharge value of 0.45 inches per year and the west half 0.225 inches per year. The polygon boundaries and constant recharge rates were constructed by extracting lines from digital surficial geology data sets based on a scale of 1:125,000 for the panhandle counties and 1:250,000 for the western counties. Some of the lines were digitized from maps in a published water-level elevation map for 1980. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

A transformation was applied to make the lines from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1996d, 1996e) more closely match the map by Havens (1982). As a result boundaries no longer match with geologic contacts from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1996d, 1996e). The differences are as large as about 656.2 feet (200 meters) ground distance or 0.032 inches or (0.081 centimeters) on 1:250,000-scale maps. Boundaries represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. Recharge polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. The recharge polygons were digitized from a folded paper map (47 inches by 19 inches) with a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.015 map inches (0.038 map centimeters) and 308.4 feet (94 meters) ground distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
