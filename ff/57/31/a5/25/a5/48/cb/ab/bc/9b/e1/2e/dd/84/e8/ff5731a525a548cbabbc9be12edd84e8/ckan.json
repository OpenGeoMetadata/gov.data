    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Recent R&amp;D associated with designing high speed rotorcraft has been greatly hampered by a lack of test data and confidence in predictions for rotors operating above advance ratio 1.0.  This proposal outlines a plan for addressing this situation through a series of rotor tests and analytical enhancements.  The three-pillared approach begins with a model rotor test in Phase I that will obtain essential data on autorotation characteristics of rotors operating at high advance ratio.  The second pillar will involve analytical enhancements for comprehensive rotorcraft analyses featuring an improved yawed flow correction and an improved lifting surface blade model that will properly shed wake off the \"leading edge\" of blades operating as reverse velocity rotors.  The third pillar will focus on improving grid generation methods for CFD solutions to appropriately model reverse and spanwise flow regions.  Phase II will see additional rotor tests and model improvements followed by incorporation of new technology into a software module suitable for immediate implementation in rotorcraft analysis and flight simulation software.  The new software module will provide a hierarchy of methods capable of modeling high speed rotorcraft blade aerodynamics for a broad spectrum of fidelity/speed requirements ranging from real-time flight simulation to high resolution CFD.
