    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Critically important inertia measurements are complex and expensive&amp;nbsp;to obtain due to the extensive fixturing and custom instrumentation&amp;nbsp;of conventional techniques. This research effort has validated a more&amp;nbsp;efficient, less risky, and faster inertia measurement technique for&amp;nbsp;aerospace vehicles. The dynamic inertia measurement method is based&amp;nbsp;on conventional ground vibration testing methods, which are routinely&amp;nbsp;performed in other types of aircraft testing. The basic concept is to&amp;nbsp;compute the inertia properties and center-of-gravity location of an&amp;nbsp;object by measuring all forces acting on the object and the rigid body&amp;nbsp;motion caused by these forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date:&lt;/strong&gt; All testing has been completed and two technical papers describing the results have been published. The DIM method was implemented to measure the mass properties of the test article, as were then the conventional pendulum oscillation methods, to compare results, level of effort, and costs. The DIM method showed favorable results for the center of gravity and moments of inertia;&amp;nbsp;however, the products of inertia showed appreciable disagreement with analytical predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; he next project phase,&amp;nbsp;testing on an aerospace vehicle, has not yet been funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;ATA Engineering, Inc. provided software and support for the&amp;nbsp;testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less risky: &lt;/strong&gt;Does not require the vehicle to&amp;nbsp;be suspended, reducing risk and equipment&amp;nbsp;needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less expensive: &lt;/strong&gt;Eliminates the complex&amp;nbsp;and expensive fixturing and equipment used&amp;nbsp;in conventional measurement techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster:&lt;/strong&gt; Dramatically decreases testing and&amp;nbsp;approval times by weeks or even months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airplanes and space vehicles (capsules and lifting body spacecraft)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automobiles and other large terrestrial vehicles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
