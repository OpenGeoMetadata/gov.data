  "notes": " The RDECOM-ARDEC Fire Control Integration Laboratory (FCIL) is capable of accommodating a broad array of combat vehicles and towed weapons systems for integration and testing of various mechanical and electrical on board components and subsystems. The FCIL is a two bay high ceiling shop with double overhead doors and is capable of housing two combat vehicles at a time. Typically, hardware and software undergoing integration, debugging, and testing are intended as a performance upgrade for a specific system through follow-on retrofitting. The FCIL is classified as open secret storage and contains a full complement of electronic instrumentation for system monitoring and data acquisition during testing, common shop tools, overhead lifts/cranes for light component removal and replacement, power supplies with NATO connectors capable of fully powering up any combat vehicle, and is heated for year-round/all seasonal work. The FCIL is approximately 2,000 sq. ft. and the vehicles currently occupying the facility are the Abrams M1A1/M1A2 Main Battle Tank and the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled Howitzer, which are primarily used to provide field support in the form of technical problem investigation and resolution. The FCIL is constantly conducting evaluations of fire control enhancements and navigational capabilities that allow our soldiers to successfully engage in combat activities while using the latest and most technologically advanced weapons.
