    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchange have been measured at 38 forest, grassland, and crop sites as part of the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux projects. A total of 97 site-years of data were compiled, primarily between 1996 and 1998 but also for 1992-1995 and 1999-2000. Half-hour flux and meteorology measurements are included plus the gap-filled half-hour estimates and aggregations to day and night, weekly, monthly, and annual periods. The FLUXNET 2000 Synthesis Workshop was held at the Marconi Conference Center, Marshall, California, June 11-14, 2000. The Marconi Flux Data Collection was compiled to aid in exploring the interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the overlying atmosphere through carbon, water, and energy exchanges. The workshop resulted in several studies to synthesize and interpret differences and similarities in long-term measurements of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere for a spectrum of ecosystems. A series of synthesis papers based on these data and studies was published in a special issue of the Agriculture and Forest Meteorology, Volume 113, 2002. The papers are listed in the reference section. This data product is being archived as a record of the data used the AFM special issue. Updates and revisions to the data are available at the FLUXNET web site.The eddy covariance technique is used for long-term continuous measurements of mass and energy fluxes to capture seasonal dynamics and allow for a meaningful scaling with respect to time. The equipment and methodology were standardized among sites by using common software and instrumentation. Comparisons of ecosystem fluxes among sites are usually performed on annual or monthly sums calculated on complete data records; however, the average site data coverage during a year was only 65%. Therefore, development and application of robust and consistent data gap-filling methods was required before fluxes could be calculated. One of the outcomes of the FLUXNET project was computer applications to process the data into complete, consistent, quality assured, and documented data sets (Falge et al. 2001a,b). Gap-filled flux data from four different filling methods are reported. Selected meteorological parameters were also gap filled to support flux estimating methods and are reported along with non-filled meteorological data. Note that the measured/estimated CO2 fluxes and storage fluxes were summed into net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ONLY NEE data are reported. ",
