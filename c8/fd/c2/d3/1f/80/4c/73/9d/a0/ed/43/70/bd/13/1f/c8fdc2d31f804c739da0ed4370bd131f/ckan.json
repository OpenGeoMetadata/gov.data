    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "An optimal alarm system is simply an optimal level-crossing predictor that can be designed to elicit the fewest false alarms for a fixed detection probability. It currently use Kalman filtering for dynamic systems to provide a layer of predictive capability for the forecasting of adverse events. Predicted Kalman filter future process values and a fixed critical threshold can be used to construct a candidate level-crossing event over a predetermined prediction window. \r\n\r\nDue to the fact that the alarm regions for an optimal level-crossing predictor cannot be expressed in closed form, one of our aims has been to investigate approximations for the design of an optimal alarm system. Approximations to this sort of alarm region are required for the most computationally efficient generation of a ROC curve or other similar alarm system design metrics. \r\n\r\nAlgorithms based upon the optimal alarm system concept also require models that appeal to a variety of data mining and machine learning techniques. As such, we have investigated a serial architecture which was used to preprocess a full feature space by using SVR (Support Vector Regression), implicitly reducing it to a univariate signal while retaining salient dynamic characteristics (see AIAA attachment below). This step was required due to current technical constraints, and is performed by using the residual generated by SVR (or potentially any regression algorithm) that has properties which are favorable for use as training data to learn the parameters of a linear dynamical system.\r\n\r\nFuture development will lift these restrictions so as to allow for exposure to a broader class of models such as a switched multi-input/output linear dynamical system in isolation based upon heterogeneous (both discrete and continuous) data, obviating the need for the use of a preprocessing regression algorithm in serial. However, the use of a preprocessing multi-input/output nonlinear regression algorithm in serial with a multi-input/output linear dynamical system will allow for the characterization of underlying static nonlinearities to be investigated as well. We will even investigate the use of non-parametric methods such as Gaussian process regression and particle filtering in isolation to lift the linear and Gaussian assumptions which may be invalid for many applications. \r\n\r\nFuture work will also involve improvement of approximations inherent in use of the optimal alarm system of optimal level-crossing predictor. We will also perform more rigorous testing and validation of the alarm systems discussed by using standard machine learning techniques and consider more complex, yet practically meaningful critical level-crossing events. Finally, a more detailed investigation of model fidelity with respect to available data and metrics has been conducted (see attachment below). As such, future work on modeling will involve the investigation of necessary improvements in initialization techniques and data transformations for a more feasible fit to the assumed model structure. Additionally, we will explore the integration of physics-based and data-driven methods in a Bayesian context, by using a more informative prior.",
