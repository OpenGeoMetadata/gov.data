    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Current methods for monitoring the water used on the ISS rely heavily on ground analysis of archival samples. Air monitors presently on board the ISS could be used for trace analysis of the water samples. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a powerful and widely used ionization technique for analysis of bio-molecules in solution and provides a potential means for introducing water into the current monitors. Ions are formed in liquid droplets and these droplets behave differently depending on the composition of the liquid. A ground study is important to characterize the spray produced from different liquid compositions in an ESI source as a first step to proposing an ESI flight experiment. This study will serve as the baseline for the flight experiment, where the effect of microgravity on electrospray is unknown. Different liquid compositions will be used in an attempt to affect the surface tension and conductivity, and, therefore, the power requirements to form an electrospray. Solutions mimicking the ISS water samples will be tested to determine if the sprays produced require different parameters from those produced using different dopants. The intended product of this project will be a report detailing the effects of solution composition, needle size, and solution flow rate using the ESI source. These results will provide a baseline for an on-orbit ESI experiment, which might eventually lead to a new ionization source for water sample analysis. A successful completion of this project will lead to a proposal aimed at studying ESI as a station detailed test objective. As ESI is currently used in ground-based studies of biomolecules, further testing of this technique for on-orbit medical monitoring may be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;",
