  "notes": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected\n               geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing\n               (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is\n               designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Estates are subdivisions of the three major\n               islands in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). The estates have legally defined boundaries and are much smaller in area than the Census Subdistricts\n               (county subdivisions), but do not necessarily nest within these districts.  The boundaries of the estates are primarily those of the former agricultural\n               plantations that existed at the time Denmark transferred the islands to the United States in 1917.  The names and boundaries of the estates are in common\n               usage by residents and in government administration.  The boundaries of the estates are as of January 1, 2010 and were provided to the Census Bureau by\n               the USVI Office of the Lieutenant Governor.  Estates can be found in the Sub Minor Civil Division (submcd) shapefile for the 2010 and 2011 TIGER/Line\n               products.",
