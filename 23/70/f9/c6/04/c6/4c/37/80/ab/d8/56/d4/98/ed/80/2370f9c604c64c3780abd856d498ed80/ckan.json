    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This research focuses on fully developing energy density sensors that will yield a significant benefit both for measurements of interest to NASA, as well as for general acoustic measurements. Previous research has developed prototype energy density sensors. The Phase I research focused on developing effective calibration techniques for these probes, testing and validating the probes to identify the most effective design, developing a sofware interface to facilitate user-friendly data acquisition, and developing software to measure acoustic directivity and sound power using the energy sensors. Phase II research objectives extend the use of these sensors to measure source directivity and sound power. Energy propagation will be determined from these measurements. A major Phase II focus will be the development of a high-temperature, high pressure design for the energy density sensor, as well as investigating nonlinear effects on these energy-based measurements.\r\nNASA applications of the technology include characterizing radiation from rocket plumes to better understand the mechanisms involved and to match numerical codes. Non-Nasa applications are many, including such tasks as in-situ measurements of sound, power and radiation characteristics of sources.",
