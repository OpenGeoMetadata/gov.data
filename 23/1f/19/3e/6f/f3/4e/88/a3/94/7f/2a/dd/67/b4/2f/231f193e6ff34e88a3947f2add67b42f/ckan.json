  "notes": "The Atlas Team at LMIC has produced a complete set of FSA 2003 air photos as 8-bit gray scale GeoTIFFs. The data have been derived from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) 2003 color orthophotography from the USDA Farm Service Agency. The parent data set for the 8-bit gray scale imagery is the photographic information obtained for the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) for 2003 and is comprised of scanned photographs that were acquired on color positive film. Acquisition was leaf-on with mature crops prior to harvest. Images have been orthorectified. NAIP imagery is quarter-quadrangle centered to provide consistent and repeatable coverage. For information about the parent data set see http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip03.html.",
