    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;In Phase I we were able to demonstrate that sample return missions utilizing high velocity penetrators (0.1- 1 km/s) could provide substantial new capabilities for sample return missions at lower cost than soft landing techniques. Key innovations include new energy absorbing material, and utilization of tethers for deployment of the penetrator and extraction of the sample, to reduce the DeltaV requirements while maximizing the probability of return , and minimizing the components that could be damaged by a hard impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work also incorporated proof-of-concept field testing of components under relevant environments. The proposed work seeks to (a) expand the modeling of the interaction of the penetrator with the surface material so that penetration depth can be more accurately predicted for different types of materials likely to be encountered at different solar system objects, (b) enhance the properties of the energy absorbing materials to handle speeds up the upper ranged for planned impacts, and (c) to perform field testing of the tether extraction of the return sample and refine the simulations of the tether dynamics. In addition, the proposed work has the potential for allowing electronic enabled penetrators which could for example be used for seismic imaging of the interior. Because of the ability to provide multiple samples, the full system which would be developed in greater detailed in Phase II will provide unprecedented analysis&amp;nbsp;of the interior structure of a solar system object. Our ability to perform modeling, lab testing and field experiments will enable the system to go for TRL2 to TRL4/5 within 2 yrs.&lt;/p&gt;",
