    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains enhanced-resolution brightness temperatures produced using the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm developed by the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU). Enhanced-resolution brightness temperature images for the Arctic and Antarctic were generated using antenna temperature data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument. SSM/I images are available for 1995 through 2008, and AMSR-E images are available for 2002 through 2010. All available measurements for a single day are averaged into twice-daily gridded files for three different equal-area spatial coverages: Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and full global. The spatial resolution is 12.5 km for SSM/I channels 19 and 22 GHz, 7.5 km for 37 GHz, and 2.5 km for the 85 GHz channel. For AMSR-E, the resolution is 12.5 km for the 6, 10, 18, and 23 GHz channels; 7.5 km for the 36 GHz channel; and 2.5 km for the 89 GHz channel. Software for reading the SIR-formatted SSM/I and AMSR-E data is also available. As scatterometer and radiometer data complement each other, these enhanced-resolution radiometer data, together with SIR format scatterometer data available from BYU, will facilitate polar research that combines information from both radiometers and scatterometers. Data are stored as scaled 2-byte integers in binary arrays with a 512-byte header and are available via FTP.",
