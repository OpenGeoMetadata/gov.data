  "notes": "During World War II, the Kodiak Naval Reservation (Figures 1 and 2) was rapidly expanded to thwart threats of a Japanese invasion. Bunkers, fuel tanks, and sophisticated electronics equipment, in addition to housing and support structures, were erected in strategic locations in and near the city of Kodiak. Due to the urgency of the fortification and the top secret nature of some projects, plans weren't always prepared beforehand nor were maps always made of the military developments. Consequently, when the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge headquarters and adjoining residences were built in 1982 on these lands leased from the military, historical information was incomplete. Although wartime records are scant, a 1943 map depicts numerous buildings, a radio receiving station, a filter and gas tanks in the area where the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service headquarters and residences are now located. None of these structures is discernible at the present time, so it is not known if they were only planned, were removed after the war, and/or have been camouflaged by vegetation. Three known seep areas exist near the headquarters building and are of concern. Any contaminants in the seeps may pose health and/or safety hazards to people, as well as to wildlife and fisheries. In addition to these seep areas, the potable water supply for the headquarters is susceptible to potential contamination from military waste and/or pesticides. Various World War II structures, and waste disposal sites are located in the Buskin River watershed above Buskin Lake, the potable water supply source for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarters. At a minimum, there is a 55-gallon drum storage area, several munitions bunkers, and an old covered dump site in the watershed above the lake. The Coast Guard has also erected several communication towers in this vicinity. Any or a combination of these items could be contributing contaminants to Buskin Lake. Pesticides may also enter Buskin Lake from any insect-abatement activities on the adjacent Coast Guard golf course. The Coast Guard has proposed spraying malathion and pyrethrin on the golf course in the past. The status of this proposal is unknown, but the golf course is merely 1/2 mile from, and is upstream of, Buskin Lake.",
