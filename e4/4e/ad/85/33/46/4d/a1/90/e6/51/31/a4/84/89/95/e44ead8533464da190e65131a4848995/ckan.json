    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Efficient nuclear-thermal propulsion requires heating a low molecular weight gas, typically hydrogen, to high temperature and expelling it through a nozzle. The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher the thrust and specific impulse. For ground test facilities that will be heating the gas to temperatures up to 4400 F (2425 C), the number of materials that can be used is severely limited. The need for compatibility with hot hydrogen limits the field even further. In this project, Ultramet will design, fabricate, and test a system for heating high-pressure hydrogen up to 2400 C. The system will comprise a resistively heated open-cell refractory carbide foam heating element and an oxide-lined rhenium tube to contain the heater. By passing an electric current through the foam ligaments, they can be heated to arbitrarily high temperatures, and the carbides are stable in hot hydrogen. In previous work, Ultramet has demonstrated the ability to make robust electrical connections to foam heaters that will tolerate high temperature operation. Unlike most other refractory metals, rhenium is both ductile and non-reactive with hydrogen. It is also very strong and creep-resistant at high temperature. Consequently, rhenium is the material of choice for the pressure vessel and other hydrogen-washed surfaces such as the convergent/divergent nozzle. In the immediate vicinity of the heater, a thin layer of zirconia or hafnia (both of which are compatible with rhenium up to their melting point) will be used to electrically insulate the rhenium from the foam heater.",
