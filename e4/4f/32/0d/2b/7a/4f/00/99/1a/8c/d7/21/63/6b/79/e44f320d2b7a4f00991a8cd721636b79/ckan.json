  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) Laboratory conducts research in the areas of robotics, automation, condition based maintenance, prognostics, health management and artificial intelligence, with the overall goal of reducing manning requirements and optimizing workload while increasing safety and productivity for fleet maintenance personnel.  Function:  The RISE Laboratory is located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ. This lab offers the space, equipment and expertise to develop and test new concepts with autonomous and semi-autonomous support equipment (SE) and information technologies.  Capabilities:  The RISE Laboratory features a multidisciplinary team of PhD and MS level personnel with an expertise in robotics, machine vision, signal processing, controls, neural networks and stochastic optimization techniques as applied to Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) and naval aviation SE. The laboratory is equipped with mobile robotic development platforms (MRDPs) and the associated maintenance equipment. The MRDPs are used in autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance and gesture recognition control experiments. Furthermore, the RISE Laboratory features an assortment of data acquisition (DAQ) hardware and work stations which are used for state-of-the-art research in condition based maintenance and prognostic analytics.
