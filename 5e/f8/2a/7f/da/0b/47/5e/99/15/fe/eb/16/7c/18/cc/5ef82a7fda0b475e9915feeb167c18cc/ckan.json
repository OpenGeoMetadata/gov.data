    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The state-of-the-art Li-ion battery technology is based on processing of lithium transition metal oxides, and graphite powder, and use of liquid organic electrolytes. It has shown limited room for further performance improvements in terms of energy density, cycle and calendar life, abuse tolerance and cost. This has heavily hindered the advancements of NASA's future space missions that need rechargeable batteries with higher energy density, longer life, and excellent abuse tolerance. In the commercial sector of electrical vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), there are also urgent needs for rechargeable batteries with significantly higher performance characteristics that appear beyond the potential of current Li-ion system.\r\n\r\nTH Chem, Inc. (THC) proposes to team with New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) to develop a new, all-solid-state Li-ion technology for NASA's future space missions that require rechargeable batteries capable of higher energy density (&gt;200 Wh/kg), longer cycle life (&gt;50,000 cycles), extended operation temperatures and radiation tolerance. The new battery system is based on development of a novel, all-solid-state, 3-dimmensional (D) battery design that exploits the full potentials of the electrode and electrolyte materials.\r\n\r\nIn Phase I, THC will demonstrate the feasibility of the new battery technology by preparation of the proposed all-solid-state 3-D batteries via processing of electrode and electrolyte precursors, followed by electrochemical evaluation of the test cells.  The concept of the new electrochemical system will be demonstrated.  THC and its team have extensive experience in advanced rechargeable battery chemistries and technologies.",
