  "notes": "This is a point dataset with two accompanying 'sample tables' [vabfldsmpap96] and [vablabsmpap96] that summarize the results of the study to inventory abandoned vessels and barges in Louisiana coastal waters. Such containers may hold oil or other hazardous wastes which could be released into the environment, or are potential repositories for future illegal hazardous waste dumping. The information gathered included location of the vessel, identification of the vessel and owner if determinable, and a priority based on its hazard potential. If hazardous materials were found on board, they were sampled for analysis. The sampling procedure called for two samples (a surface and a bottom sludge sample) to be taken from every compartment of every vessel. The inventory located 802 vessels. The barge_LOSCO_1996 inventory was made available to interested parties and as a result some of these vessels have since been moved by the owners, or by a salvage company with (or possibly without) the owner's permission.",
