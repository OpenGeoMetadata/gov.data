    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Solar-Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) Level 3BS data product consists of daily, 1 nm resolution, solar spectral irradiances and selected solar parameters.  The instrument was a three-channel ultraviolet spectrometer that measured the magnitude of solar and spectral irradiances in the wavelength range from 119 to 420 nm.  The design of the instrument allowed for observations of both the sun and bright blue stars, whose spectra is assumed to be constant. SOLSTICE was flown on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and designed to measure the full disk solar irradiance with high precision and accuracy to follow short-term (minutes to hours), intermediate-term (days to weeks), and long-term (11 year sunspot, and 22 year solar magnetic field cycles) variations in the solar output.\n\nThe SOLSTICE Level 3BS data consists of 1 granule per day. The data are normalized to an earth-sun distance of 1 AU, and instrument degradation have been applied to the data. Included with the primary solar spectral irradiance values are daily average integrated intensities of Lyman alpha (121.6 nm), O-I (130.4 nm), C-IV (154.8 nm) and C-I (156.1 and 165.6 nm), and core-wing ratios of Mg-II (280.0 nm) and Ca-II (393.3 nm), as well as Carrington latitude and longitudes.  The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.",
