  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 3x3 meter cell size representing the backscatter (intensity) of several deep coral priority areas off the Atlantic Coast of Florida, derived from data collected from the Lost Coast Explorer in October 2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from 10/26/2010 to 10/27/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.x software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.",
