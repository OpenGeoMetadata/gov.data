    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Our primary goal is to automatically analyze textual reports from the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database to detect/discover the anomaly categories reported by the pilots, and to assign each report to the appropriate category/categories. We have used two state-of-the-art models for text analysis: (i) mixture of von Mises Fisher (movMF) distributions, and (ii) latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on a subset of all ASRS reports. The models achieve a reasonably high performance in discovering anomaly categories and clustering reports. Each category is represented by the most representative words with the highest probability in this category. In addition, since the inference algorithm for LDA was somewhat slow, we have developed a new fast LDA algorithm which is 5-10 times more efficient than the original one, therefore more applicable for the practical use. Further, we have developed a simple visualization tool based on non-linear manifold embedding (ISOMAP) to generate a 2-d visual representation of each report based on its content/topics, which gives a direct view of the structure of the whole dataset as well as the outliers.",
