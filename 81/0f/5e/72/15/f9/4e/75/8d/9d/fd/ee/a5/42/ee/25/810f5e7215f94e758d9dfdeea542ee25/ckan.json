    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The problem of distance-based outlier detection is difficult\r\nto solve efficiently in very large datasets because of potential\r\nquadratic time complexity. We address this problem and\r\ndevelop sequential and distributed algorithms that are significantly\r\nmore efficient than state-of-the-art methods while\r\nstill guaranteeing the same outliers. By combining simple\r\nbut effective indexing and disk block accessing techniques,\r\nwe have developed a sequential algorithm iOrca that is up to\r\nan order-of-magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. The\r\nindexing scheme is based on sorting the data points in order\r\nof increasing distance from a fixed reference point and\r\nthen accessing those points based on this sorted order. To\r\nspeed up the basic outlier detection technique, we develop\r\ntwo distributed algorithms (DOoR and iDOoR) for modern\r\ndistributed multi-core clusters of machines, connected\r\non a ring topology. The first algorithm passes data blocks\r\nfrom each machine around the ring, incrementally updating\r\nthe nearest neighbors of the points passed. By maintaining\r\na cutoff threshold, it is able to prune a large number\r\nof points in a distributed fashion. The second distributed\r\nalgorithm extends this basic idea with the indexing scheme\r\ndiscussed earlier. In our experiments, both distributed algorithms\r\nexhibit significant improvements compared to the\r\nstate-of-the-art distributed methods.",
