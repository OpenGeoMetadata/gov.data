Hotline is an internal system used by NOAA responders and their colleagues to communicate during an incident. Examples of Hotline reports include daily situation reports, summaries of resources at risk, predicted trajectories (of spilled oil or other hazardous materials), and weather and tide predictions. Many incidents for which Hotline reports were generated are summarized in a final report (with a subject title of \\\"Report - Final\\\"). Typical subject titles for Hotline reports include \\\"Report - Weather\\\", \\\"Report - Situation\\\", and \\\"Report - Trajectory.\\\" Especially in the case of a significant incident, there may be many hotline reports in the Historical Incidents database related to a single incident.Important note concerning the NOAA \\\"HOTLINE\\\" Communications System: this system is used for NOAA internal communications and the reports are put in chronologically. There is NO corrective \\\"post editing\\\" of the reports. As a result of this, early reports may have information that later proved to be incorrect. Sometimes these errors are corrected in a later report, but sometimes corrections are made over the phone or in-person, and no correcting message is entered. This reflects the use of this system as a real-time spill communications system and is not intended to be an event-log.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
