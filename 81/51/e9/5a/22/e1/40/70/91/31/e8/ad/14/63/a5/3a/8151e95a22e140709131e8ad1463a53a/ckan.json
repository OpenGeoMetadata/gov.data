  "notes": "This digital publication, GPR 2008-2, contains 'preliminary final' geophysical data that were produced from airborne geophysical surveys conducted in 2007 for the eastern part of the Styx River survey area, southcentral Alaska. Aeromagnetic and electromagnetic data were acquired for about 180-sq miles of a 708-sq mile survey in 2007. The remaining survey data will be acquired in early spring 2008, processed, and released to the public later in 2008 as GPR 2008-3. Upon its completion, the new data will be merged with this preliminary final dataset. 'Preliminary final' denotes that the data has been processed to the final stage but the merging process may require minor changes to the maps and data. Slightly revised maps will replace these maps when the data for the entire survey is released as GPR 2008-3. Similarly, the database and grids will be expanded, any may contain slightly different data near the merging edges of this data contained on this CD-ROM. Data provided in GPR 2008-2 include processed (1) linedata ASCII database, (2) gridded files of magnetic data, a calculated vertical magnetic gradient (first vertical derivative), apparent resistivity data, and a digital elevation model, (3) flight lines in vector format, and maps of the five geophysical grids in PDF format. Data are described in more detail in the \"GPR2008-2Readme.pdf\" and \"PF_EastStyx-Linedata.txt\" files included on the CD-ROM.",
