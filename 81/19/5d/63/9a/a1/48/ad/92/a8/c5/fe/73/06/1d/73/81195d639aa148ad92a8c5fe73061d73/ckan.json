  "notes": "This data set consists of a digitized polygon of a constant recharge value for the Enid isolated terrace aquifer in northwestern Oklahoma. The Enid isolated terrace aquifer covers approximately 82 square miles and supplies water for irrigation, domestic, municipal, and industrial use for the City of Enid and western Garfield County. The Quaternary-age Enid isolated terrace aquifer is composed of terrace deposits that consist of discontinuous layers of clay, sandy clay, sand, and gravel. The aquifer is unconfined and is bounded by the underlying Permian-age Hennessey Group on the east and the Cedar Hills Sandstone Formation of the Permian-age El Reno Group on the west. Cedar Hills Sandstone Formation fills a channel beneath the thickest section of the Enid isolated terrace aquifer in the midwestern part of the aquifer. The polygons boundary was digitized from a photocopy of a paper map from a ground-water modeling thesis and report. The map digitized was published at a scale of 1:62,500. The recharge value reported in the ground-water modeling thesis and report for the Enid isolated terrace aquifer is 2.3 inches per year. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

The recharge polygon represented at this scale is indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. The recharge polygon was digitized from a photocopy of a paper map (19.0 inches by 17.5 inches) with a maximum registration root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.007 map inches (0.018 map centimeters) and 36 feet (11 meters) ground distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
