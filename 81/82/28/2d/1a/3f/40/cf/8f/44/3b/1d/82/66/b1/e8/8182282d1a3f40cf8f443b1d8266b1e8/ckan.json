  "notes": "An investigation was made into chemical contamination at 26 National Wildlife Refuges in the Lower Mississippi River Ecosystem. Samples of water, sediment, and fish were collected and passive sampling devices that accumulate persistent organic chemicals were deployed. Residues of current-use pesticides (CUPs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsv (PAHs) and mercury (Hg) were measured along with limited toxicity testing and exposure biomarkers. Organochlorine pesticides were detected at every refuge and total DDT and tozaphene exceed published levels for the protection of fish or wildlife at nearly half the refuges. Current-use pesticide were detected at every refuge, but at only one-half the frequency as nearby off-refuge areas. Mixtures of multiple pesticides were often detected and their detection frequency was clearly associated with their use and persistence. About 25% of the refuges contained pesticides at concentrations exceeding aquatic-life criteria and over 65% of the off-refuge sites exceeded criteria. Concentration of PCBs were low throughout the region, with no evidence of potential for adverse biological effects. Concentrations of PAHs were low throughout the region, except near oil and gas production facilities were very high concentrations caused 100% mortality in sediment pore water toxicity tests. Concentrations of Hg sediment and fish were generally below levels of concern. Overall, there was strong evidence that over one-half of the refuges are experiencing meaningful adverse biological effects from chemical contamination.",
