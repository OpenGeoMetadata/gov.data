  "notes": "In 1989, a reconnaissance investigation of the Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge (Las Vegas NWR) in New Mexico was conducted to determine if inorganic and organic contaminants were present in sediment and biota. Samples of sediment, and plant, invertebrate, fish, and bird tissue were collected from eight sites and analyzed to determine if trace elements, organochlorine compounds and chlorophenoxy acid herbicides were present at levels which would pose risks to fish and wildlife resources. All bird tissue and most fish tissue samples had detectable levels of DDE and one killdeer sample containing 3.7 parts per million (ppm) exceeded the predator alert level of 1.0 ppm (National Academy of Sciences 1973). Total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration in one American coot egg sample was 0.19 ppm, exceeding the PCB alert level of 0.1 ppm (International Joint Commission U.S. and Canada 1988). One mallard had 37 percent inhibition of AChE activity, indicating the bird had been exposed to an organophosphate or carbamate insecticide. Selenium concentrations in adult mallard livers and kidneys ranged from 11 to 21 micrograms/gram (ug/g) dry weight (dwt), all other bird livers and kidneys ranged from 3.83 to 9.17 ug/g dwt. Selenium in other biotic samples ranged from 0.66 to 2.76 ug/g dwt for aquatic invertebrates, 1.17 to 8.31 ug/g dwt in fish and 1.47 to 1.69 ug/g dwt for bird eggs. One sediment sample from Melton Pond had 0.31 ug/g dwt selenium and one spike rush seed sample from Clodfelter Ponds had 1.26 ug/g dwt. Based on these results, mallard tissue and some fish tissue show a degree of selenium contamination. All other samples (biota and sediment) were within background ranges for selenium. Mercury concentrations in some biotic samples were at levels that may be harmful to fish and wildlife. Mercury in fauna samples ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 ug/g dwt for invertebrates, 0.08 to 0.46 ug/g dwt in fish, 0.50 to 2.90 ug/g dwt in bird livers and kidneys and 0.03 to 0.34 ug/g dwt for bird eggs. Mercury was below the analytical detection level of 0.04 ug/g dwt for plants and 0.02 ug/g dwt for sediment. Lead levels ranged from 14.40 to 37.20 ug/g dwt in all sediment samples. One aquatic invertebrate sample had lead residue levels of 13.10 ug/g dwt. Method detection limits for lead in biota were too high to adequately determine risk of dietary exposure to fauna. Clodfelter Pond and Melton Lake consistently had the highest levels of inorganic compounds in sediment, plant and invertebrate samples followed by the Middle Marshes which had elevated mercury residues in invertebrates and birds.",
