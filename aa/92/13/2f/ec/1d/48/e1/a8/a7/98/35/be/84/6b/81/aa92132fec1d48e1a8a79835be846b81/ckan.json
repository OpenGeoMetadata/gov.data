  "notes": "The primary objective of the refuge's water management plan is to create water conditions that will result in an ecologically diverse wetland community. Sedimentation has adversely impacted submergent growth and reduced water level fluctuations in floodplain wetlands. Moderate to heavy infestations of carp have also uprooted vegetation and resuspended bottom sediments. As a result, submergent vegetation has declined; river bulrush and american lotus, which become established when water levels remain static, are now dominant emergents in many wetlands; and the lack of exposure of bottom sediments has curtailed the recycling of nutrients and the establishment of moist soil vegetation. Primarily through water level manipulations, the refuge is working towards improving wetland quality. Drawdowns on refuge wetlands have met with minimal success. Beaver activity and silt deposits at wetland outlets have  curtailed efforts to lower water levels on Fisher Lake and Continental Grain Marsh. Water levels will be kept as low as possible on these wetlands again in 1991. Two years of moderately low water levels on Blue Lake have resulted in an increase in river bulrush. Therefore, water levels will be held at maximum  pool in 1991. The drawdown and burn on Louisville Marsh was successful in opening up the marsh and water levels will be kept high during 1991 to ensure river bulrush is kept under control. Different drawdowns approaches will be implemented on the several small artificial and modified wetlands on the Long Meadow Lake Unit. Response to the drawdowns will be closely monitored to establish baseline data which will help fine tune future water management plans. Negotiations are currently underway with the Northern States Power Company to initiate another drawdown of Blackdog Lake in 1991. The past two years have resulted in positive vegetative and wildlife response, significantly  increasing wetland quality. Although the 494 moist soil unit, blackdog pools 1 and 2 and big rice lake have water control structures, they remain unmanageable without further construction or equipment purchase.",
