  "notes": "A multibeam backscatter image (0-35 m water depths) mosaiced from hydrographic data collected during a July/August 2002seafloor survey. A Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) was pole mounted to the bow of a California State University Monterey Bay survey launch to acquire the sonar data. A TSS POS/MV was used to compensate for vessel motion and a Seabird SVP19 plus was used to measure sound speed. Navigation and line planning were accomplished using Hypack software. Sonar packets, motion sensor, and navigation data were logged in Isis Sonar as XTF files. Backscatter was normalized and mosaiced using software developed by the University of New Brunswick Ocean Mapping Group.",
