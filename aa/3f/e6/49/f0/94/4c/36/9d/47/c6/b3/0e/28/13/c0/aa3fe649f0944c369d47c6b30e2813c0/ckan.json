    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Paragon Space Development Corporation proposes an innovative, efficient and practical concept that utilizes Solid Oxide Electrolysis for regenerative air revitalization.  The concept is innovative because it safely eliminates handling of hydrogen, and works irrespective of gravity and pressure environments with no moving parts and no multi-phase flows.  The innovation is efficient because it requires no expendables while being compact with minimal impact on mass.  The innovation is practical because it evolves from the well-established, current state of the art in oxygen production for the regenerative air revitalization system slated for the International Space Station.  The approach proposed addresses the crux of the innovation in Phase I through modeling and experimentation to immediately identify the most feasible approach to its implementation.  Phase II will encompass more detailed experimentation to optimize the subsystem design resulting in a fully functioning regenerative oxygen subsystem for advanced life support.  The consequence is significant because solid oxide electrolysis is an inherently suitable technology (and possibly the only technology) for enabling 100&#37; oxygen regeneration from carbon dioxide and water vapor, two byproducts of crew activity that must be managed regardless.",
