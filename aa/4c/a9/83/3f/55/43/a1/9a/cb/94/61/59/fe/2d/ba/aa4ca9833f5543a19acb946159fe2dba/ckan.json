  "notes": "This GeoTiff is a representation of seafloor topography in Northeast Puerto Rico derived from a bathymetry model with a principle component analysis (PCA). The area covered includes the shallow water area (0-60m deep) of the Northeast Ecological Reserves: including the waters off of Fajardo and Luqillo, to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound, La Cordillera Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island. The PCA image was created using Envi 5.1, and is based on nine morphometric derivatives of the bathymetry, such as slope, curvature and rugosity. The bathymetry model was created by integrating soundings from several different sources (1900-2013), including high resolution coastal LiDAR, NOAA Single-beam and multibeam bathymetry, and historical lead line soundings, into a multi resolution (4m, 20m, 100m) depth model. The PCA image was used to delineate the different shallow water benthic habitats of NEPR.",
