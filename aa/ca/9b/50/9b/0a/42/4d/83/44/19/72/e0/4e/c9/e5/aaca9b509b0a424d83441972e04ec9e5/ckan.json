  "notes": "Nested 6th and 7th code Hydrologic Units (HU) were produced for the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS). Preliminary 6th code HU were produced using the USGS GIS Weasel program with 10m Drainage Enforced-Digital Elevation Models (DE-DEM). These boundaries were hand edited to remove very small Basins. In an effort to conform to existing and ongoing efforts, the boundaries were given to the USFS and BLM for review. Working with the BLM and FS we produced both a 6th and 7th code HU coverage combining our original lines, their lines, and digitizing new lines where necessary. We discussed discrepancies in boundaries with the Salem, Eugene, Coos Bay, and Roseburg districts of the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) and Siuslaw National Forest (SNF). The final 6th and 7th code HUs are attributed with: 1)unique identifiers, 2) corresponding 5th code HU code number (7th codes HU have the corresponding 6th code HUnumber as well), 3) 4th and 5th code HU names, and 4)codes to differentiate between true, composite and frontal watersheds. Basins meet the National Resource Conservation Service's guidelines for 6th code HUs.",
