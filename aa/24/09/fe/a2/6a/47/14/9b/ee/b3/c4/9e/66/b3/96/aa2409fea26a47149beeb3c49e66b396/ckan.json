If the effects of vegetation are ignored, it was assumed that fuel moisture varies according to aspect. That is, with all else being equal, fuels are typically drier on southwesterly aspects, and moister on northeasterly aspects. Relative fuel moisture was assigned to 3 aspect classes : Azimuth (degrees) Relative Solar Radiation Relative Fuel Moisture 1 to 80; 351 to 360 low high Flat; 81 to 170; 261 to 350 moderate moderate 171 to 260 high low Excluding the effects of real-time weather, fire behavior is dependent upon the structure, composition, and arrangement of fuels; fuel moisture, and slope.",
