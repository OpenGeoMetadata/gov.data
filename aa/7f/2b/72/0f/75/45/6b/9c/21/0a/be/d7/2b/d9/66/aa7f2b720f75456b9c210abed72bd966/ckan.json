  "notes": "These are Rights-of-Ways (ROW) on Idaho BLM land (and some other Federal agency land) as shown on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Master Title Plats (MTP). Every GIS ROW feature has a \"CASEFILE\" value, also known as the serial number of the ROW. This corresponds to the LR2000 database, which is a national BLM database for federal lands information. This GIS ROW feature class can be joined or related to exported information from LR2000 using the \"CASEFILE\" (GIS) and \"SERIAL_NR_FULL\" (LR2000) fields. NOTE: the LR2000 information is only available to internal BLM users and is not available to the public as it contains sensitive information. This ROW data for any given area may not be complete due to new ROW activity or because of missed or coincident ROW features during the initial data creation. It is recommended that a thorough inventory of all ROWs in a specific project area be obtained (an LR2000 report can provide this) and the GIS ROW data be checked before using this data for projects needing utmost ROW accuracy. The ROW data that was digitized is what was present on the MTP at the time of the digitizing done for that township. The project was performed over several years. Therefore, the \"early\" townships digitized are more out of date regarding ROWs compared to the ones more recently digitized. Unfortunately, there is no attribute that indicates the digitizing sequence. Any updates to this ROW feature class should be sent to the BLM Idaho State Office GIS staff for incorporation into the statewide GIS ROW feature classes for improvement over time.",
