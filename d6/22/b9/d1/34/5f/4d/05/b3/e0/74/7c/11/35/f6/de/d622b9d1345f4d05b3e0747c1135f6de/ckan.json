Fixed-transit stations were placed at existing rail and bus transfer points or downtown commercial districts as well as locations in suburban, high-growth areas. The areas surrounding these stations accommodate a significant amount of future population, housing, and employment investment. Option C represents a transportation network that focuses investment on transit. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
