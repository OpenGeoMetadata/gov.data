  "notes": "Although pollinators are an important constituent of healthy ecosystems, they are often poorly represented in natural resource inventories. This is especially true for nearshore coastal areas such as those found at Willapa NWR. Several priority habitat restoration projects (coastal dune, coastal native grassland, and estuary) at the Refuge rely on revegetation using native plants that are dependent on pollinators. These surveys would provide baseline data to inform planning and adaptive management of habitat restoration on the Refuge. An inventory of native pollinators pre- and post-restoration will provide a valuable measure of success for the project. The Service’s policy for Biological Integrity, Diversity, and Environmental Health (601 FW 3.3 [3.6D]) establishes historic conditions “prior to substantial human related changes to the landscape” as the basic reference for protecting, mimicking, or restoring natural processes. The vegetative community now found where the native coastal grassland habitats existed in the past has been radically changed through more than a century of grazing and farming to one dominated by non-native vegetation. Based on 701 FW 2.3E, it is important to conduct this survey because it will provide baseline data and record benchmark conditions used to support development of a restoration plan including pre- and post- monitoring of native pollinators by establishing the status of, and trends in bee populations on the island and provide surveillance to detect changes in the structure and function of ecological systems.Bee populations have been declining over the past 60 years in both the U.S. and Europe. The incidence of so-called Colony Collapse Disorder, where entire colonies either disappear or stop reproducing has been on the rise, and several causes have been implicated, including the broad use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids. Whatever the cause, the loss of these pollinators has implications for both the natural vegetative environment and agriculture in general. Refuges, which undergo less development and are under less pressure for pesticide use, offer areas throughout the U.S. for bees to thrive. The contribution of refuges to the overall bee population, however, is unknown. This project is designed to develop a baseline for species composition on the Refuge. Carried out long-term and in a wide enough area, it may also serve to develop a long-term population trend.This cooperative monitoring effort involving sampling at Willapa NWR and other Region 1 refuges across the landscape will increase knowledge about presence of bee fauna, their distributions, and seasonal phenology on a portion of the mainland refuges within Region 1. It would also identify the presence of at-risk species of bees supported by the R1 refuges. Where practical, refuge staff is required to monitor the status and trends of fish, wildlife, and plants in each refuge in accordance with the NWRS Improvement Act. This legal mandate also requires refuge staff to maintain biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health. This survey will monitor native bee species present on the refuge and, therefore, address these aspects of the Improvement Act.",
