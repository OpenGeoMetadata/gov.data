  "notes": "The nesting population of greater sandhill cranes on Malheur National  Wildlife Refuge, Oregon has declined from 236 pairs in 1971 to 181 pairs in 1986 when predator control began. The population has continued to decline to 168 pairs in 1989. Some of the decline is attributed to lost habitat on Mud, Malheur and Harney Lakes due to record high lake levels (14 pairs). Losses on Mud, Malheur, and Harney lakes had already taken place by 1986, but could not be verified until a comprehensive pair count was done in 1988. The remainder of the decline is attributed to the low recruitment of young into the population during the years 1971 through 1985. Since cranes generally don't breed until they are four to five years old, the population is expected to continue to decline until the recruitment of young equals or exceeds the mortality of adults. In 1989, 226 coyotes were removed by the following methods: aerial gunning (19 percent), calling and shooting (15 percent), trapping (43 percent), snares (3 percent), and denning (19 percent). An estimated 39 ravens were removed using 39 dozen eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional 16 ravens were shot. A total of 28 raccoons were taken by trapping. Sandhill cranes experienced a good production year in 1989. Overall sandhill crane hatching success was 61 percent in 1989, below the goal of 75 percent identified in the predator control plan. Predators took 33 percent of the nests this year (raven - 13 percent, raccoon - 6 percent, coyote - 4 percent, arid unidentified predators - 6 percent). This was the first year of the five-year extension for the predator control program. The program could not begin until approvals were received from the Regional Office for coyote and raccoon control, and from Washington for use of DRC- 1339 for raven control. Coyote gunning began in mid April (normally early February) and raven control did not begin until late May. Therefore, nest success was good considering the late start of the predator control efforts. Crane chick counts were conducted on September 6-9. Thirteen chicks were observed in the Double-0 Unit (a record count), and an additional 36 were counted from the ground in the Blitzen Valley, yielding a total of 49 cranes produced. A sample of monitored crane nests revealed 61 percent nesting success. Estimated brood survival was 25 percent, equaling the predator control plan goal. Although nesting success did not meet the objective, it appears brood survival was quite good, yielding a record recruitment rate of 12.7 percent. The 49 chicks produced should help the population build, and hopefully achieve refuge crane production objectives in the future.",
