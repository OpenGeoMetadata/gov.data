  "notes": " The Laboratory for Computational Cultural Dynamics (LCCD) is a multidisciplinary research laboratory housed in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS). The lab focuses on the development of algorithms to automatically track open source information related to terror groups, tribes, and socio-cultural-political entities, automated tools to learn models of the behaviors of such groups from both automatically gathered data and specialized hand-coded data, algorithms to support different kinds of behavioral analytics (including forecasting, what-if reasoning, policy formulation) and computational environments that allow human decision makers to leverage both their own expertise and the data and algorithms developed at LCCD to best support their mission. In order to address this formidable task, LCCD consists of a mix of computer scientists, social scientists and policy makers associated with the University of Maryland, country or regional experts, as well as partners from a number of companies, government organizations and other institutions.
