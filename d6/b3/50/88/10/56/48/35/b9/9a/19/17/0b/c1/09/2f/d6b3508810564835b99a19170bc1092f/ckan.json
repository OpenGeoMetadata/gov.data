This includes metered-dose inhalers (breath-actuated or dose-metering nebulizers) formulated as suspensions or solutions of active drug in propellants and dry powder inhalers marketed as single- or multi-dose units. High Throughput for Drug Analysis PHI-DO Laboratory has recently increased its mass spectroscopy capabilities to allow for the inclusion of screening for Toxins and Poisons, and PDE 5 Inhibitors using the LCMS and screening for weight loss drugs in dietary supplements using GCMS.
