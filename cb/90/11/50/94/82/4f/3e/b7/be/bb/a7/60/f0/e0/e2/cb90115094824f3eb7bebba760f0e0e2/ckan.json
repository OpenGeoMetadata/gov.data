    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means,  standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24  hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM  local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local  time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses  westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring  gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90  minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in  separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are  always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at  the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a  map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are  reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image  and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The  gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create  Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths  where there is no coverage for that day.\n            \n            The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells,  from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each  grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte  floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of  counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that  were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps  from the daily gridded products.\n            \n            The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. \n\n            The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.\n\n            The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.\n\n                  (The Shortname for this product is AIRS3STD).",
