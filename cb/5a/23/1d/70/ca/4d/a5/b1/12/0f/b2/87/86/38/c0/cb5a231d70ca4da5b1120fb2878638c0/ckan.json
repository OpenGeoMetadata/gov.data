The dataset includes a 100 foot buffer around all hydrologic features except sewage lagoons. The hydrography layer used for the buffer is the Kansas 1:24,000 scale hydrography dataset developed by USDA-NRCS. The land use is then determined within the buffer from interpreting USGS 1:12,000 Digital Orthophotograph Quarter Quadrangles ground conditions in 1991.",
