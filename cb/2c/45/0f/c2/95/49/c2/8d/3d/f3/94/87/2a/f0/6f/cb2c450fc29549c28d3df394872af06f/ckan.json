    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Spaceflight adaptations include muscle atrophy, decreased bone mineral density and reduced aerobic capacity making effective resistance exercise countermeasure hardware necessary for safe and successful space exploration.  Real-time control is applied to an electric servo-motor to provide resistance and aerobic exercise in a lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable design with self-contained power generation.  The technical objectives of the system design are that it be easily configured and stowed, and require minimal power to operate including a pedal generator to supply electricity. The hardware is instrumented to document exercise sessions and provide whole body axial loading and individual joint resistive loading that simulates free weights with eccentric overloading.  The loads are adjustable in 2.5 kg increments to maintain muscle strength and bone density, and aerobic exercise is provided with pedal attachments.  The Phase 1 work plan includes initial prototype design, fabrication, and demonstration.  The portable design can provide resistance and aerobic exercise in virtually any aspect of spaceflight (extended use on ISS, short-term lunar sortie missions, and future Mars exploration).  The system also has application for in-home neuromuscular rehabilitation and controlled resistance exercise.\r\n",
