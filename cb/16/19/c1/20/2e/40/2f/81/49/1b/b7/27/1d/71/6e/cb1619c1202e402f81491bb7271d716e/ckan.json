    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The increased system complexity resulting from interaction of human and automated systems in aviation programs introduces new challenges that need to be addressed. Many notable flight incidents can be wholly or partially attributed to crew error, either due to inexperience with the aircrafts automated control systems or in response to component failures or adverse conditions. Flight safety experts can piece together information and data from multiple sources to identify the cause after an accident or incident has occurred whether it is due to human errors, machine failures or a combination of both. It is therefore reasonable to expect that much of the information is already dispersed in various databases and, with the right tools, flight safety experts can identify deficiencies and factors that may provide indicators or serve as precursors of accidents. Such actionable knowledge will lead to better training, design and/or onboard systems to ensure safety. In response to this need, SSCI proposes to build Analytics to Improve Reliability &amp; SAfety in Flight Environments  (AIRSAFE), a software toolbox that assists flight safety analysts in discovering key factors and their interactions among a large number of potentially relevant factors, testing one's hypothesis on the key factors to safety, and identifying previous incidents that support the hypothesis. The software toolbox is built on our previous and on-going efforts, such as DARPA's XDATA program, in BigData machine learning.",
