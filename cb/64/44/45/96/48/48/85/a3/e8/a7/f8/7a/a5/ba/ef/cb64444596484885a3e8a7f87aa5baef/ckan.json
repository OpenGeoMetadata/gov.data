    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We detail all of the facets of adapting classical model checking to a real aerospace system, in- cluding deriving the formal model and a set of specifications from natural language descriptions. To ensure the model checking results are meaningful, we have to ensure that both the model and specifications correctly reflect the intentions of the designers, thus we employ model validation and property debugging techniques. We demonstrate the utility of enhancing LTL satisfiability checking by taking the fairness constraints of the system model into consideration. We argue that specification debugging in real applications deserves more attention in future research efforts, and the utility of a system formalization, model and specification debugging, and verification trilogy for model checking real systems under development.\r\nIn this paper we assume there are no hardware failures or lost messages. As the AAC design develops and hardware details are decided by AAC designers, we plan to take the failure rates of the chosen components into consideration, i.e. by extending our work to probabilistic model checking using PRISM [19]. Previous work has reported on analyzing the safety of air traffic control systems using simulation [3] or fault trees [1]. By extending the model we designed in this paper, we can carry out safety analysis using PRISM to capture the dynamic interactions in the AAC.",
