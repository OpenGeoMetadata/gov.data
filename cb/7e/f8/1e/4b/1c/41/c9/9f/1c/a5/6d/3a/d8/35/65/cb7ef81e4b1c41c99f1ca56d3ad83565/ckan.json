    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tMaintenance of the musculoskeletal system is of crucial importance for mobility of astronauts during long-duration missions and upon return to 1-G. However, substantial research shows that skeletal muscle undergoes atrophy during spaceflight. Reports on muscle atrophy are typically based on study of cross-sectional area, a measurement that ignores more detailed changes in muscle structure. Knowledge of the structure of skeletal muscle is key to understanding its function. Ultrasound imaging of muscle during contraction could provide important insight into the relationship between muscle structure and function. Importantly, the use of novel ultrasonographic techniques to evaluate dynamic muscle structure may provide critical information regarding the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced strength loss.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tFive subjects performed various passive and active contractions while ultrasound images of the rectus femoris were obtained. We demonstrated that acquisition of contracting muscle is obtainable using a high frequency ultrasound probe, and that the contracting muscle can be tracked with various algorithms using a custom Matlab program. This work was completed in September, 2012. Further investigations are needed to determine the most valid algorithm for tracking muscle, to assess the reliability of the muscle tracking technique, and to ascertain the association between torque and skeletal muscle strain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;em&gt;Tracking Algorithms in Matlab Program:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tUltrasound images of tissue consist of a set of intensity forming &amp;lsquo;speckles&amp;rsquo; that create patterns. If the ultrasound probe remains in the same position during a movement, the changes in the speckle patterns represent movements in the tissue. These movements can be directly and actively followed using speckle-tracking algorithms. Movements of the tissue over the course of an image sequence can then be quantified by monitoring changes in the position of the speckles. Five muscle tracking algorithms were tested with each algorithm outputting muscle strain throughout contractions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;em&gt;Analysis of Ultrasound Images with Matlab Program:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tOn a typical ultrasound image (&lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;), the&amp;nbsp;cross sectional area&amp;nbsp;of the muscle (rectus femoris) appears in the center of the image. Visual inspection confirmed that relative motion between the edges can be used to estimate the changes in length and thickness of the muscle. The muscle tracking algorithms automatically tracked the change in position of each marker from the initial frame to subsequent frames for the duration of the contraction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
