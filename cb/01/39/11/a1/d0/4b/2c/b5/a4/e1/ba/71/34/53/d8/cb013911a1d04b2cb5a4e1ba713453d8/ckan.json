The DEMs were standardized to 30 meter grid cells, UTM Zone 15, NAD83, vertical units in feet and were joined into one statewide file (also available as county files). All the DEMs are Level 2 quality except Town Line Lake, Grand Portage and Grand Portage OE N which likely are still Level 1. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources created the Level 2 DEMs for 88 quads in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.",
