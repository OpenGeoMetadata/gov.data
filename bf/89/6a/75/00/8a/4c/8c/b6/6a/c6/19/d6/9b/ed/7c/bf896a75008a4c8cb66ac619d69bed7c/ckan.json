    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to design and develop easy-to-use Ground Control Station (GCS) software for low-altitude civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations. The GCS software will allow a UAV user to 1) specify the mission in the user's language, rather than the traditional jargon of mission and flight plan-ning, and 2) execute the mission without relying on additional personnel who have specialized piloting skills. The user specifies the mission through a combination of natural-language instructions and graphi-cal interfaces, and the GCS software translates the user instructions into a mission plan that is executed autonomously. This innovation will enable a paradigm shift in UAV operations by freeing end users from their dependency on expert operators to fulfill the mission. The proposed Phase I work focuses on requirements analysis and the design and demonstration of a prototype GCS User Interface. We will also develop a plan for a Phase II effort to further develop and demonstrate the GCS software with an existing UAV platform for a specific application. This research directly addresses the NASA Earth Science Enterprise requirement for Automation and Planning technologies that \"allow either spacecraft or ground systems to robustly perform complex tasks given high-level goals with minimal human direction.\"",
