  "notes": "The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) has created high-resolution land cover/use data sets for the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) from 1:15,000-scale color infrared aerial photos. These data have been used to create a variety of products, one of which is a data set used to classify aquatic areas. The 1989 and 1991 aquatic areas data sets were created by first generalizing the available land cover/use data into a land/water data set, then reinterpreting the aerial photography within the areas classified as water to determine the type of aquatic area. Area coverage for this data set is the Upper Mississippi River between Minneapolis, MN and Cairo, IL, and the Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi to Joliet, IL. Most of the individual data files were created from 1989 land cover/use data, except for the La Grange navigation pool on the Illinois River. Due to high water conditions present in 1989, 1991 aerial photography and land cover/use data were used to create the La Grange data set.",
