    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time, 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies. LIDAR has proven its value in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, and aircraft wake vortices.\r\nOf particular interest under this NASA sub-topic is the development of an airborne Lidar system capable of detecting and measuring aircraft wake vortices and turbulence out ahead of the aircraft in order to improve aviation safety. To perform this task well a Lidar must have certain characteristics and be paired with a highly optimized wake and turbulence processing algorithm. The key development area for detection of turbulence at cruising altitude is Lidar transmit energy and pulsewidth. High energy output on the order of 1.0 mJ for low flying manned or unmanned aircraft (10,000 ft) and 10 mJ for commercial aircraft (30,000 ft) is required. Aerosol density decreases rapidly as a function of altitude and the backscatter coefficient at 30,000 ft is only 4x10-10 as opposed to 2x10-7 at sea-level. Furthermore, commercial airliner crews will need at least 30 seconds reaction time after turbulence is detected in order to take action, requiring the Lidar system to see 6.67 km ahead (assuming an average flight speed of 500 mph). \r\nOther key requirements of an airborne Lidar system involve the size and power consumption of the system.  The limited space and available electrical power on an aircraft necessitate that a Lidar system be compact and efficient.  In addition, the system must be able to be integrated onto the aircraft without inhibiting other flight systems.\r\nSIBELLOPTICS proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to develop and test an Er-doped polarization maintaining (PM), large mode area (LMA) fiber amplifier to boost transmitted Lidar power to greater than 1 mJ per pulse.",
