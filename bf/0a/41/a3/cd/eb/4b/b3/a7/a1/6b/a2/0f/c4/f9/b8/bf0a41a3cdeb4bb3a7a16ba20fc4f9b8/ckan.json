    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This chapter described at a very high level some of the considerations that need to be made when designing algorithms for a vehicle health management application. The choices made here affect the quality of the diagnosis and prognosis (covered in Chapter 7). Therefore, the algorithmic design choices are made in conjunction with the design choices for diagnostics and prognostics to optimally support these tasks. Furthermore, additional considerations imposed by computational constraints, resource availability, algorithm maintenance, need for algorithm re-tuning, etc. will impact the solutions.\r\nIt should also be noted that technological advances, both in hardware and software, impose the need for new solutions. For example, as new materials and new sensors are being developed, the algorithmic solutions will need to follow suit.\r\nIn general, there seems to be a trend to have more sensor data available. While this is potentially a good thing, sensor data provides value only when it is being processed and interpreted properly, in part by the techniques described here. Testing of the methods, however, requires the “right” kind of data. Generally, there is a lack of seeded fault data which are required to train and validate algorithms. It is also important to migrate information from the component to the subsystem to the system levels so that health management technologies can be applied effectively and efficiently at the vehicle level. It may be required to perform elements described in this chapter between different levels of the vehicle architecture.",
