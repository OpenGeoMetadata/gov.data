  "notes": "This study was undertaken to assess several contaminant concerns at Quivira National Wildlife Refuge. The objectives of this project were (1) to determine if agricultural chemicals are present in waters entering Quivira, (2) to determine the extent petroleum hydrocarbon contamination from oil extraction activities on Quivira, (3) determine if selenium is present at Quivira in concentrations of concern, and (4) determine if other inorganic or organic contaminants are found at levels of concern in food of interior least terns and snowy plovers. The investigation found that contamination does not appear to be widespread at Quivira. However, several compounds and trace elements were detected at elevated concentrations in only one or two samples. One composite forage fish sample contained elevated concentrations of arsenic, copper, and lad. Aromatic hydrocarbon indices suggest that petogenic contamination of soils is occurring at Quivira and particularly around one group of oil production facilities. Elevated concentrations of selenium were detected in water samples taken throughout the summer at one site. Triazine compounds, including atrazine, could be a serious concern for Quivira due to the frequency of detection of triazines in surface water samples and the potential for effects, at low concentrations, to amphibians. However, more detailed work would be needed to evaluate this situation. Although ednrin was detected in 71% of the invertebrate samples it was found at low concentrations. We do not believe that at the concentrations detected in this study that endrin is a concern for Quivira. However, endrin is more toxic to fish than to invertebrates and can accumulate rapidly in fish exposed through food sources. Although it is unlikely that the concentrations of the organic compounds and trace elements detected in the samples are high enough to cause direct mortality, they could be causing detrimental effects through the long term exposure or from the combination of several compounds or elements. It is difficult to make conclusions about the possible impacts of wildlife based on the limited sampling for this study. More comprehensive sampling in areas where elevated concentrations were found might reveal the spatial distribution and level of occurrence of the compounds and elements. The largest reductions in pesticide levels on the Refuge might be gained from working with landowners in the Rattlesnake Creek Watershed to reduce the amounts of pesticides used on crops and to establish buffers along the streams and wetlands in the watershed to reduce the amount of pesticides entering the water. Refuge staff should continue to inspect the oil production facilities and work to prevent spill and initiate quick cleanup of any spills. A more comprehensive investigation of groundwater should be initiated to determine if groundwater is contribution selenium and other traces of elements to the Refuge.",
