    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-space manufacturing provides the opportunity to build replacement parts on-demand and repair structure to change the paradigm for space exploration mission supportability.&amp;nbsp; Advanced Manufacturing technology such as additive manufacturing and electron beam welding are being developed and utilized on earth but have not yet been adapted to an in-space system context.&amp;nbsp; The objective of this project is to demonstrate the concept of operations for an in-space manufacturing system.&amp;nbsp; Due to the small-scale of this project and the large cost of advanced manufacturing technology systems, sub-element technology demonstrations were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing concept of operations was demonstrated with the help of JSC&amp;rsquo;s integrated Power, Avionics, and Software facility.&amp;nbsp; A data connection was created between the iPAS flight computer in Houston, TX and LaRC&amp;rsquo;s Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3) additive system in Hampton, VA to simulate remote manufacturing.&amp;nbsp; Crew displays and controls were developed and integrated with the iPAS Flight Deck of the Future.&amp;nbsp; A technology demonstration was completed as part of the iPAS asteroid demonstration.&amp;nbsp; Finally, metal and plastic material specimens and parts were fabricated for structural testing and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space structure repair was tested by evaluating weld-positioning capability of the Dexterous Manipulator Trainer (DMT), the ground version of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) currently on the International Space Station.&amp;nbsp; DMT positioning testing determined that the SPDM would be useful for gross positioning but fine positioning would be too challenging.&amp;nbsp; JSC&amp;rsquo;s Robonaut, which is still in development, was also tested and performed more adequately for fine positioning tasks, though it&amp;#39;s still unclear if it performed well-enough for on-orbit welding. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
