    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current and upcoming NASA space links require both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&amp;C, ranging and voice services and highly efficient High-data rate links supporting Mission or Payload Data. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both kinds of links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the development, test, and optimization of new algorithms and modulation schemes require a high-speed platform able to be reconfigured as needed. Such a product would feature an open and modular architecture, allowing users to independently load and route custom code blocks. A modular and flexible High Rate Receiver Backbone (HRRB) would allow customization of some processing firmware and should accommodate advances in deployed link formats more easily than units \"factory loaded\" for particular signal types.\r\n\r\nSRI's Phase 1 SBIR researched, developed an architecture and test bed, and coded and tested an initial set of waveforms as a baseline for a Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver. The results of this effort showed the technical and commercial viability of such a unit. The proposed Phase 2 effort will extend this innovation by developing and implementing an IF front end, refining and extending the performance of the ADC/DAC sections and hardware architecture, extending the architecture to support programmable and configurable decoding processing capacity, testing performance with both extended development support modulators/coders as well as other available high-rate modulators, and delivering a realized HRRB for further NASA use. Additional market segmentation, analysis, and prospect identification would be conducted in preparation for either a Phase 3 or independent SRI development of a market-ready Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver (PHMR).",
