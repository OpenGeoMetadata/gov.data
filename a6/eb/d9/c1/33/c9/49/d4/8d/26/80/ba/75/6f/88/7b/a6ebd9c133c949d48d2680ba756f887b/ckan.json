    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD), had previously developed an orbital flight experiment to 1) test the feasibility of a water purifier for use in zero-gravity conditions, and 2) demonstrate sustained operation of a two-phase flow system with a passive gas/liquid separator. By design, the influent fluid was kept under pressure to saturate the water with gas; however, farther downstream, the fluid mixture is returned to near atmospheric pressure and fed into a vortex separator. The separator and overall system function was designed for operation in both Earth-gravity and zero-gravity conditions. The gas within the system is vented off downstream of the separator, and most of the liquid is re-circulated in the processing loop over the duration of operations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tMFEST proposes to modify the experiment to test the two-phase flow and separation functions without using simulated or active water processing. This creates the following benefits/features:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tthis project &amp;nbsp;will test a two-phase flow system and vortex separator concept that continues to be considered for space applications, under the challenging environment conditions of launch, zero-g, and entry, and with sustained operations;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;two-phase flow and separator systems are needed in numerous technical areas (e.g., life support, thermal, science) and have been identified as a critical technology;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tno long-duration testing for variable gravity has been accomplished for this separator concept/design, and&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tit leverages outdated experiment/hardware (has been on the shelf for a decade) for future spaceflight missions.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tMulti-phase flow systems can be applicable to technologies designated in multiple draft Office of Chief Technologist (OCT) Space Technology Roadmaps: Technical Area TA02, In-Space Propulsion Technologies; TA03, Space Power and Energy Storage; TA06, Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems; TA07, Human Exploration Destination Systems; and TA14, Thermal Management Systems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe experiment was originally designed for the Space Shuttle mid-deck, but was never flown due to mass, crew time, and other mission limitations. For the suborbital flight opportunity, the primary purpose of the test program would be to verify functional operations of the flow system and unique separator for a relatively long duration with variable gravity, in support of future space vehicle designs and missions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
