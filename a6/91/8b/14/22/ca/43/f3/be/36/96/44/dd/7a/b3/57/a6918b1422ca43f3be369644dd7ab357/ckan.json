  "notes": "This dataset (MISC_0_3M_CLR_2008) includes truecolor ortho imagery covering an area north and south of the VT/Canadian border. VCGI extracted the imagery from a larger dataset developed by 3001 Inc for the Federal government. The MISC_0_3M_CLR_2008 extract is limited to all collected imagery north and south of the VT/Canadian border. The imagery has been kept in its native coordinate system (UTM zone 18 and 19). For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 6 meter horizontal RMSE for locations within the United States. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum, spheroid GRS80. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.",
