    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hot Corrosion of turbine engine components has been studied for many\nyears.  The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II\nHot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Nickel-based\nsuperalloys have shown strong resistance to high temperature oxidation\nattack and, of course, excellent high temperature strength.  Modern\nturbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in\npart by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for\nnickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures\napproach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of\nType II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by\nlocalized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing\nsalts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the\nfatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at\nhot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools\nneeded by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion pit\nformation and fatigue life degradation due to corrosion pits are not\ncurrently available.   Barron Associates, Inc. and its research partners\npropose to develop corrosion pitting and fatigue life models for\nnickel-based superalloys subjected to Type II hot corrosion.  The models\nwill be commercia-lized and made available to the research and\ndevelopment community.",
