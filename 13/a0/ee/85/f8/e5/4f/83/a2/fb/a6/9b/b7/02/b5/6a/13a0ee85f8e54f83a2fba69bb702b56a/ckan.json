    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Busek Co., Inc. and Morehead State University propose to develop a 6U CubeSat capable of reaching a lunar orbit from GEO.  The primary objective is to demonstrate heretofore unavailable high Isp(~3000s) with a small and very efficient ion thruster.  A mission to the moon will demonstrate a propulsion technology that enables a variety of other deep space missions. Unlike the well-known and much larger DC ion thrusters flown on missions such as Deep Space 1 and Dawn, the proposed thruster is powered by an inductively coupled RF discharge with condensable propellant.  The chosen propellant is stored as a high-density solid at room temperature with minimal vapor pressure.  Such property enables the storage tank to be small, lightweight and moldable for maximizing propellant volume.  These benefits are further realized by the use of Busek's miniature RF ion thruster (RFIT) system.\r\nBusek's ion thrusters were developed to answer the need for a small yet high-performance EP device, as their DC counterparts are difficult to scale down and achieve long life due to the internal cathode.  The BRFIT-3 thruster proposed for the LunarCube has a 3cm grid diameter, is close to 50&#37; efficient and delivers variable Isp and thrust of ~3000s and ~2mN, respectively.  With this performance, &lt;0.8kg of propellant can sufficiently provide delta V &gt;3km/s.  The thruster's life by estimation is in excess of 20,000 hours.  An additional objective is to demonstrate that much of the spacecraft electronics, primarily the C&amp;DH portion, can be based on low-cost components and survive the deep space environment.  The mission will also require pioneering approaches to ADCS and power generation.  Initial design of the solar arrays includes two winged panels mounted on Honeybee Robotics' gimbals, and together they will deliver peak power of ~96W.  One option for the payload will be a miniature long wavelength IR camera made by Malin Space Science Systems that could be used for geological studies.",
