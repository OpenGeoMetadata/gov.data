    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Typical communication satellites use traditional waveguide front-end architectures due to excellent electrical performance and high reliability. However, these systems are extremely massive and use large volume mostly due to the low-insertion loss waveguide. Replacement of the waveguide components by microfabricated parts without substantially affecting the electrical performance can lead to a breakthrough in wireless communications.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed SBIR project is to develop low-cost, reliable, miniaturized RF MEMS switch components suitable for a variety of communication subsystems. Two approaches will be investigated. The first approach will be looking at monolithically integrating RF MEMS switches within the PolyStrataTM technology, developed at Nuvotronics in Blacksburg, VA as part of the DARPA 3DMERFS program. This approach should enable disruptive low-loss and high-Q RF components from S-band up to W-band. The second approach will rely on state of the art known good RF switches to be assembled on the low loss PolyStrata backplane. This second approach will provide lower loss, higher density and higher power handling than the current RF MEMS components. The proposed technology can be applied to multiple operating frequencies at a minimum cost due to the batch capability of the PolyStrata process.\r\n",
