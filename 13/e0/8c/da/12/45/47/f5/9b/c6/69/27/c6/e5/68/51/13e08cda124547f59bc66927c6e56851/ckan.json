  "notes": "The goal of this project was to develop maps of the historical fire regimes and original vegetation of CMR to provide a background for decisions around restoration and land management with fire.  The intent was to produce the best approximation of the natural fire regimes and vegetation that existed at time of the demise of the buffalo in 1882.  This is the vegetation that dominated the landscape prior to that time for some 6,000 years. Understanding these is essential to restoring habitats and managing lands for the full range of animal and plant species that depend upon them for habitat.  Nearly all the upland original vegetation of the CMR was in some way structured by fire.  The fire pattern at CMR is complex: some areas were exposed to frequent fire while others were very fire sheltered.  Since the site contains many species that need some degree of fire or shelter from fire, the GIS layers can serve as base maps for guidance in using fire to restore habitats.  Potential also may exist for restoring some beaver wetlands and other natural vegetation communities and wildlife habitats originally present and now diminished or extirpated.  In the interest of preventing loss of old-growth trees, such as happened in the July 2006 fires, it may be possible to manage fuel loads in the more fire-exposed parts of the refuge such as the Lost Creek area, and in prairie-woodland boundaries, such as those in the Sand Creek section, to prevent stand-destroying fires that would have not been typical of the natural fire intensity  in those places.  A new mapping method using landscape fire ecology was used to reconstruct presettlement fire frequency (Map 1) and presettlement vegetation (Map 2).  This involved using nine lines of evidence to reconstruct original conditions.  These included fire scar chronologies from three different places on the refuge; field sampling of the best remnant vegetation on many of the 282 soil mapping units of the six counties of CMR; compilation of historical photos and other historical information relating to vegetation and fire; estimating fire effects in each kind of vegetation on each soil series and each topographic situation; characterizing things that contribute to ignitions and promote the spread of fire versus those that obstruct fire in the landscape; mapping regional and local fire compartments; and identification of fire-frequency indicator species and fire-frequency indicator plant communities.  Descriptions were prepared of the original vegetation and fuel types of the refuge for each soil series.  The presettlement fire regime method used here is expected to have application throughout the West in landscapes where frequent fire was an important determinant of vegetation in presettlement times.  Such maps can be used as guides for to meet NWR wildlife and recreation objectives while restoring natural fire regimes and maintaining examples of the full range of rich natural communities and species that the area first encompassed.\nSignificant findings:\no\tThe pre-European fire regime at CMR was lightning driven, in contrast with some other parts of the country where Native Americans were the dominant force.  This was true at least after the 1730-1750 acquisition of horses by the Blackfeet.  Prior to 1730 the Blackfeet and their precursors along the upper Missouri River may have used fire in the landscape in ways similar to those of the Mandans in the early European contact period downstream.  If true, that would  indicate that the fire frequencies indicated on the GIS map are conservative.\no\tIgnitions are more frequent at CMR than in many other parts of the shortgrass prairie because of four local orographic ignition sources: the Little Rocky Mountains, the Judith Mountains, the Bearpaw Mountains and the Snowy Mountains.  Ignitions from the four sources reach their maximum in the center of the refuge and this pattern has existed for thousands of years.  Any burning by First Nations people would have b",
