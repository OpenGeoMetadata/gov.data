    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\ta)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Addition of flywheels to space flight exercise hardware in order to simulate free weight inertia increases wear on equipment and has resulted in costly repairs to exercise hardware in space. Ground based exercise studies have shown improved bone density and muscle strength with exercise equipment that use pneumatic resistance forces and have no added inertial forces beyond that derived from the mass of the human body.&amp;nbsp; An exhaustive literature search revealed no direct comparisons between pneumatic resistance exercise devices and weight stack or free weight exercises used to maintain or strengthen bone and muscle. In the absence of a direct comparison, exercise prescriptions and exercise equipment requirements specifying simulation of weight stack type rate dependent variability in forces on the ARED for health maintenance have been based upon opinion. Use of weight stack exercise equipment and flywheels to simulate weight stack characteristics reduces loads below the target level in up to half of the weight lifting cycle, results in poorly controlled rate dependent variability in loads, and can induce injurious peak loads. This variability undermines the exercise requirements for constant load with a high eccentric to concentric load ratio agreed upon by musculoskeletal and exercise scientists who defined ARED requirements for ISS. Numerous studies in the literature show exercise equipment that provides high concentric and eccentric loads improves bone density and muscle strength, with and without transient loads due to mass moment of inertia. Despite low levels of evidence&amp;nbsp; that impact&amp;nbsp; (separate from high sustained loads) is beneficial to bone and muscle, many exercise guidelines continue to state impact is desirable for bone maintenance. Impact is contraindicated in individuals with arthritis and joint injuries. Therefore, use of the ISS ARED to demonstrate that high constant loads without transient loads maintains bone and muscle will be beneficial to NASA in simplifying hardware design and maintenance and will improve exercise safety. Information generated in this proposed activity will be used to support&amp;nbsp; exercise improvements that will enhance durability, safety, and efficiency of exercise hardware for space flight.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
