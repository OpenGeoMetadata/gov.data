  "notes": "This data set is one component of a digital terrain model (DTM) for the SWFWMD Polk District. This record includes information about the LiDAR data for the following SWFWMD tracts: Hampton, Judy, Lake Wales, Peace River (North) and Polk Remainder. All of these tracts are located in Polk County. Please see the Bounding Coordinates for each tract for the location within Polk County. Information that is specific to each tract has been maintained. HAMPTON TRACT This data set is one component of a digital terrain model (DTM) for Hampton Tract, Polk County, Florida encompassing approximately 43 square miles. This dataset is comprised of 48 LiDAR files, based on the DISTRICT 5,000' by 5,000' sheet index system (17951-17958, 18114-18121, 18363-18370, 18526-18533, 18259-18266 and 18594-18601) in the LAS file format. The raw data was collected at an average ground sample distance of 1-meter. Other components of the DTM include: 3-D breaklines along hydrographic features in the Shape file format; lake/pond polygons (in 3D) in the shape file format; obscured area polygons (in 2D) in the Shape file format; and hard/soft breaklines (in 3D) in the Shape file format.

This dataset is comprised of 14 LiDAR files, based on the DISTRICT 5,000' by 5,000' sheet index system (17632-17636, 17795-17799, and 17959-17962) in the LAS file format. The raw data was collected at an average ground sample distance of 1-meter. Other components of the DTM include a personal geodatabase containing: obscured vegetation polygons; road overpass polygons; road breaklines; soft feature breaklines; water body polygons; coastal shorelines; 1-foot contours; hydrographic feature breaklines, and island polygons in accordance with the SWFWMD 2006 Topographic Database Design. Date of Collection: 20060125 Bounding Coordinates of tract: West Bounding Coordinate: -81.925929 East Bounding Coordinate: -81.848175 North Bounding Coordinate: 28.350110 South Bounding Coordinate: 28.308789 LAKE WALES This data set is one component of a digital terrain model (DTM) for Lake Wales, Polk County, Florida encompassing approximately 10.75 square miles. This dataset is comprised of 12 LiDAR files, based on the DISTRICT 5,000' by 5,000' sheet index system (22365-22367, 22528-22530, 22691-22693 and 22854-22856) in the LAS file format.

This dataset is comprised of 1,281 LiDAR files, based on the DISTRICT 5,000' by 5,000' sheet index system in the LAS file format. The raw data was collected at an average ground sample distance of 1-meter. Other components of the DTM include: 3-D breaklines along hydrographic features in the Shape file format; lake/pond polygons (in 3D) in the shape file format; obscured area polygons (in 2D) in the Shape file format; and hard/soft breaklines (in 3D) in the Shape file format.

This dataset is comprised of 478 LiDAR files, based on the FL Statewide 5,000' by 5,000' sheet index system in the LAS version 1.1 file format. LiDAR acquisition dates were January 27, January 30 through February 20, 2005. The raw data was collected at an average ground sample distance of 2.1 feet. Other components of the DTM include a personal geodatabase in accordance with the SWFWMD 2006 Topographic Database Design containing: obscured vegetation polygons; road overpass polygons; road breaklines; soft feature breaklines; water body polygons; coastal shorelines; hydrographic features breaklines; island polygons; and 1-foot contours. Final products include FEMA-compliant LIDAR-derived DTM data and 1-foot contours (for cartographic visualization purposes only) meeting or exceeding National Map Accuracy Standards for 2-foot contours. This area is not a tract, but an addition of areas to the Polk District data set. This data set consists of three areas within Polk County. The approximate bounding coordinates for each area are given below. Area 3 borders the east and north sides of the Peace River (North) and Judy Tract data sets. The bounding coordinates for Area 3 are generalized here, but it is actually a multi-sided polygon with many vertices.
