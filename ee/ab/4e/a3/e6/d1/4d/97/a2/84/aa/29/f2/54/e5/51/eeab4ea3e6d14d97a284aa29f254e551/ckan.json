  "notes": "Federally managed fisheries that currently have mandatory logbook and bycatch reporting requirements for the Southeast Region include snapper/grouper/wreckfish. which are required to report all discards, including protected species. Logbook data are most useful in estimating bycatch when reporting is mandatory, because a key advantage of logbooks is the ability to use them to cover all fishing activity relatively inexpensively. However, in the absence of any observer data, there are concerns about the accuracy of logbook data from these and other fisheries. Biases associated with logbooks primarily result from inaccuracy in reporting of species that are caught in large numbers or are of little economic interest (particularly of bycatch species) and low compliance rates. Many fishermen may perceive that accurate reporting will result in restricted fishing effort or access. This results in a disincentive for reporting accurate bycatch data, and an incentive to under-report or not report (NOAA 2003a). The advantage of logbooks as compared to other sampling methods is that logbooks are usually required of all fishery participants and can provide good estimates of fishing effort. Reliable measures of effort are crucial for extrapolating observed bycatch rates to the fishery as a whole, to determine total bycatch levels. Another advantage is that logbook programs are much less expensive than observer programs. The costs usually include producing and distributing the logbooks, data entry, database maintenance, and analysis. As with fishery surveys, logbook programs are generally not implemented solely to collect information on bycatch. Therefore, the cost of collecting bycatch data via logbooks is marginal, and may be limited to costs associated with the entry and analysis of the bycatch data (NOAA 2003a).  In many fisheries, logbook programs are more useful in providing estimates of total effort by area and season that can then be combined with observer data to estimate total bycatch.",
