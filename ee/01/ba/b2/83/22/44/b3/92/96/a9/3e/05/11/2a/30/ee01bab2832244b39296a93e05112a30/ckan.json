    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The high-intensity level acoustic load generated by large launch vehicle lift-off propulsion is of major concern for the integrity of the launch complex and the vehicle payloads. The currently practiced computational methods are unable to offer the reliability of both the noise generation mechanism and acoustic environment. In order to uniquely address both of these critical aspects, the proposed approach will unify the physics of noise production with propagation and structural interactions. This method will utilize hybrid LES/RANS modeling established in NASA production flow solvers (Loci-Chem and OVERFLOW) capable of realistic descriptions of flow-acoustic interactions. A non-dissipative acoustic Boundary Element Method (BEM) will be coupled with the well-resolved noise source for high-quality acoustic environment predictions, equipped with the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for solution acceleration. In Phase I, merits of the proposed approach will be investigated for plume impingement problems. A high-performance simulation architecture, easy user interfaces and post-processing utilities will be developed for complex geometries and efficient large-scale simulations.  Phase II efforts will involve refinements and extensive evaluations for high-resolution noise source modeling, transition of mixed speed flow regimes, wave propagation through non-uniform flow, and supercomputing capabilities facilitating new insights into rocket exhaust acoustic loading and comprehensive noise suppression analysis.",
