    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The new Constellation vehicles, habitats and robots will be highly\r\nsensored and generate large amounts of data.  For this data to be\r\nuseful to humans monitoring these systems and to automated algorithms\r\ncontrolling these systems it will need to be converted into more\r\nabstract data.  This abstracted data will reflect the trends and\r\ncharacteristics of the systems and their environments.  Currently this\r\ndata abstraction process is manual and ad hoc.  It is manual in the\r\nsense that either humans do the abstraction in their heads or the data\r\nabstraction is done by hand-coding computer programs for each data\r\nitem.  It is ad hoc in the sense that each data abstraction is\r\ndeveloped on its own with no representation of how it relates to the\r\ntasks being performed or to other data abstractions.  In this project\r\nwe propose building a Data Abstraction Architecture (DAA) that allows\r\nengineers to design software processes that iteratively convert\r\nspacecraft data into higher and higher levels of abstraction.  The DAA\r\nalso formalizes the relationships between data and control and the\r\nrelationships between the data themselves.  The DAA consists of\r\nrepresentations for data and data abstractions, a data store, a\r\nabstraction architecture processing engine and a development\r\nenvironment.  We will evaluate the architecture using three NASA\r\ndomains: 1) a lunar outpost monitoring and control application; 2) a\r\nrobotic scientific survey application; and 3) a vehicle procedure\r\nexecution scenario.
