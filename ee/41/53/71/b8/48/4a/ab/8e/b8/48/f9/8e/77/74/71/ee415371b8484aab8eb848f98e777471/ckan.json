    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Installation effects arising from propulsion airframe interaction are known to produce substantial variations in the in-situ jet noise. A hybrid LES/RANS computational framework is proposed for prediction of noise from the engine and airframe, and interactions between airframe and propulsion systems. \r\nThe basis of LES (large eddy simulation) is that the energy-bearing turbulent eddies in the dominant noise-generating region are directly captured in the simulation. Since LES must resolve the turbulent eddies it requires a grid which captures these motions; the number of grid points needed for LES is much larger than those for RANS and thus a brute-force LES of the entire noise producing region in a propulsion-airframe interaction problem is not feasible. However, the noise generation physics of these flows allows a logical assembly of a hybrid simulation tool where low-fidelity models (RANS) in one region of the flow are combined with turbulence-resolving models (LES) in other regions of the flow. Acoustic effects are another segment of propulsion-airframe interaction problem. Sound generated by various components of engine is altered by the presence of wing, fuselage, deployed flap etc. In the present proposal, alteration of sound due to the presence of airframe is added through application of Boundary Element Method (BEM) and an acoustic projection technique (FW-H surface method). \r\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of using this framework, we focus on simulating flow configuration corresponding to a separate-flow nozzle of by pass ratio  5 with round fan and nozzle operating at the takeoff cycle point of with freestream Mach number of 0.28. Simulation results will be validated against experiments carried out in the Low Speed Aeroacoustics Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at NASA Langley's Jet Noise Laboratory (JNL). The high-fidelity model developed and validated in Phase I will be extended to explore more complex engine/airframe configurations in Phase II.",
