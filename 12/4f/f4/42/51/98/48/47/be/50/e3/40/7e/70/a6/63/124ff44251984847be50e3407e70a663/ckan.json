    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A Vaisala CT-25K ceilometer was installed at an old-growth forest site located at the km 67 Eddy Flux Tower site in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil, off Kilometer 67 of BR-163 south of Santarem in April 2001 and remained operational through December 2003, with reliable data being collected between May 2001 and June 2003.Annual, 2001 to 2003, 30-minute average cloud base and backscatter profile data and measurement statistics (sample count, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) are presented in 15 ASCII comma-delineated files. In addition, the cloud base values (m) and measurement statistics for the three reported cloud base levels have been consolidated in 3 annual comma-separated files.The ceilometer provides 15-second measurements of cloud base (three levels up to 7500 m), echo intensity, and a 30-m resolution backscatter profile. The ceilometer reports vertical visibility during periods when the sky is obscured but a cloud base is not detectable. The ceilometer was operational for a sufficient amount of time to examine wet-to-dry season variations in cloud cover fraction and cloud base height.",
