  "notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted this study in response to concerns that releases of raw sewage from the Starkville sewage treatment plant were adversely affecting fish and wildlife resources in Hollis Creek within and adjacent to the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge. Water quality data indicated that releases from the sewage treatment plant were the likely source of elevated concentrations of nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria at several stations on Hollis Creek. These elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria could potentially cause an outbreak of disease (e.g. salmonella poisoning and avian botulism) in waterfowl populations using the wetlands adjacent to Hollis Creek within the boundary of the refuge. Dissolved oxygen levels were also severely depressed at station 3 on Hollis Creek during several periods in 1999. Organochlorine compounds were not detected in the sediment samples. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, and chromium were above predator protection levels in fish samples from Hollis Creek within the refuge. The sources of PCB, mercury, and chromium contamination in the fish samples were not determined. Organochlorine compounds (dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, p,p'DDE) were elevated in wood duck samples. Organochlorine compounds were detected at low levels in raccoon tissue samples. All metal concentrations in sediment samples were less than the appropriate level of concern with the exception of mercury. Mercury was elevated in one of the sediment samples from site 2 just below the sewage plant outfall. Zinc was the only metal detected at elevated concentrations in the wood duck and raccoon tissue samples. Analyses of fish blood plasma revealed that endocrine disruption had occurred in over fifty percent of the fish collected. Further studies are required to determine whether the endocrine disruption is caused by releases from the sewage treatment plant or from contaminants detected in the fish. Analyses of the wood duck and raccoon blood plasma indicated that endocrine disruption was not occurring in the wood ducks and raccoons collected from the refuge. The bioassessment of Hollis Creek did not indicate that releases from the sewage treatment plant were adversely affecting the macroinvertebrate fauna inhabiting the stream.",
