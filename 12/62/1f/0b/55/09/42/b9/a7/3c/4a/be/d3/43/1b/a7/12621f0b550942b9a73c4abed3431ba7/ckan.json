    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The value of measuring sleep-wake cycles is significantly enhanced by measuring other physiological signals that depend on circadian rhythms (such as heart rate and temperature) and environmental conditions that are known zeitgebers, such as light exposure. As a result, a more complete picture of crewmember circadian rhythms and the environmental factors that entrain them will aid in determining adequate sleep levels and the countermeasures necessary to achieve them. In order to maximize safety, performance, and research value, crewmembers are in need of a device that unobtrusively measures sleep-wake cycles alongside environmental factors. This device must measure and communicate these signals while requiring very little crew overhead, a low energy budget, and a radically long battery life. \r\nOrbital Research Inc. (Cleveland, OH), with academic and commercial partners, proposes to design and prototype a Circadian Rhythm Measurement System (CRMS). Orbital envisions the CRMS to be a compact, light-weight unit worn on the upper part of the non-dominant arm. In contrast with more common wrist-worn devices, this positioning will provide additional battery space for energy storage and access to rich biological signals (heart rate and skin temperature). A consumer fitness device marketed by Orbital's commercial partner that makes use of upper-arm positioning has proven to be comfortable and inconspicuous to tasks involving the hands. The Orbital CRMS effort will focus on extremely energy-conscious design and minimally obtrusive user experience. The final product will measure sleep/wake cycles alongside heart rate, skin temperature, and light exposure without required intervention for 2 weeks or longer, transmit daily (or more frequent as needed) reports to an ISS computer automatically, and will provide feedback to the user upon request. Orbital will heavily leverage its existing technology and expertise to achieve these design goals.",
