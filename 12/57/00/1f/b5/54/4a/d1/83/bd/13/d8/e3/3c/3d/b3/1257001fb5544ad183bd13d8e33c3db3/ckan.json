    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The proposed research will develop novel enabling thermal management technology addressing subsystem (on-board processing and electronics thermal management) as well as spacecraft level design. The proposed validated prototype system would achieve the following engineering advantages:(1) EHD/capillary-driven thermal management system with low mass/volume and power consumption which limits the total power dissipation required of the thermal subsystem; (2) high heat transfer coefficient mechanism using thin film evaporation to maximize the heat rejection temperature and reduce the required radiator area; (3) self-regulating and smart fluid management to permit heat rejection from an arbitrary surface to the lowest available temperature sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current state of? the art for electronics thermal control, wherein thermal control hardware is remotely ?integrated and requires relatively massive, voluminous and power consuming resources?as well as large temperature differences to? serve as the driving potential transferring? dissipated heat. &amp;nbsp;These characteristics impede ?the goal of capable, efficient, and?miniaturized on-board processing systems. Furthermore, processing capability is limited by thermal control considerations, such as the amount of heat rejected, the heat flux along the path of heat rejection, and the temperature difference between? the electronics components and the thermal sink. Thus, technologists seek to integrate the thermal management? solution directly into the chip layout, substrate structure,?and/or package design. This will substantially? boost the cooling performance, while introducing? significant reduction in the package size, and requiring? much smaller overall system temperature driving potential:?a 3-D integrated solution that is lighter, more compact, and?capable of greater heat transport. In addition, a? two-phase device would provide thermal uniformity, reducing thermal stresses and thus enhancing overall?component reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionally, this ?concept will reduce the thermal resistance? between the chip and the radiator, raising? the heat rejection temperature with little cost? in power consumption. The net effect is to ?increase the available temperature for heat rejection, presenting the spacecraft with the advantages of increased power levels and/or reduced radiator mass and volume. The prototype TMS hardware will consist of an integrated heat sink chip embedded hybrid EHD/capillary-driven fluid management device that would ensure liquid supply and system self- regulation at the evaporative surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;",
