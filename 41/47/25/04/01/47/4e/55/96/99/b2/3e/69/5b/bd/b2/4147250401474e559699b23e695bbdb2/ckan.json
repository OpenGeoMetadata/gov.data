  "notes": "These boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a real estate interest. Interior boundaries between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here, contact the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Although these boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic and some management areas are closed. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.",
