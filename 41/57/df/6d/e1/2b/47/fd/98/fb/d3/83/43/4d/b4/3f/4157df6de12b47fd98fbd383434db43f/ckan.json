  "notes": "This minor civil division (MCD) boundary file was derived from U.S. Census 1990 TIGER/Line files, contains 1990 Census population data for Minnesota's MCDs, and matches 1990 Census statistics. Minor civil divisions are political or administrative units such as cities and townships. Since some MCDs are made up of non-contiguous areas (and thus of multiple polygons), a convention was developed to ensure that the total population would not be counted for each polygon. Two versions of the file are included; one contains county boundaries, the other does not.",
