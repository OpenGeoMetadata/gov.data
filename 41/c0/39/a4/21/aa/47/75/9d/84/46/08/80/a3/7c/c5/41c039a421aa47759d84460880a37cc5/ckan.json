    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase 1 proposal to NASA requests $99,055.69 to enhance multiple mission support in ground stations through the use of software defined radios and virtual machines to create a software-defined ground station (SDGS).  This proposal responds to NASA SBIR topic S4.09 \"Autonomous Multi-Mission Virtual Ground and Spacecraft Operations\". The significance of our SDGS work is that the monolithic, stovepipe, and hardware centric nature of ground stations will be reduced.  Major system components will be moved to software, thereby promoting remote, network-based maintenance, upgrades, and new technology development.  Off the shelf software modules will be available, but also mechanism for low-level ground station customization for mission specifics; all done remotely over the Internet.  Costly hardware upgrades will be reduced or eliminated. Our innovation is in the intelligent combination of software-defined radio techniques and virtual machines.  This enables a near complete software solution to primary ground station functions. It simplifies ground station hardware and enables flexible application support. In Phase 1 we propose to architect an SDGS system for support of expected small satellite missions.  We will prototype basic elements with an on orbit or engineering model satellite system from our partners. Commercial applications include communication support for satellites and high altitude balloon systems.  Our customers will include NASA, NSF, DoD, and private satellite builders such as universities and venture space. The PI, Dr. James Cutler, has extensive small satellite and ground station experience.  He has prototype a global ground station network to operate satellites as if they were nodes on the Internet. Our facilities located in Northern California have tools for computer and radio development, and access to small satellite systems and ground station resources.",
