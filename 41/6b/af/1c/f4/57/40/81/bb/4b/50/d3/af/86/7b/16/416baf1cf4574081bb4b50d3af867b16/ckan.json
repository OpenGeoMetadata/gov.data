  "notes": "_(Abstract):_  Standâ€“alone and easy to use geographic toolkit that allows non-GIS users to relate the renewable energy resource (solar and wind) data to other geographic data, such as land use, protected areas, elevation, etc.\r\n\r\n_(Purpose):_  The Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) Geospatial Toolkit (GsT) is a map-based software application that can be used for decision making and policy analysis in addition to planning for future energy projects. The SWERA application utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to develop common scenarios to evaluate potential locations for solar or wind energy plants.\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_ Enhancements to the GeoSpatial Toolkit (GsT) were funded by USAID's Southeast Asia Regional Initiative/Energy (SARI/E).  These enhancements include additional functionality and data development not available with the standard GeoSpatial Toolkit.\r\n\r\nFunctionality\r\n---------------------------\r\nThe additional functionality that has been added is a link from the GsT to the HOMER application, which provides analysis on system optimization.  The user will select a point on the map by clicking on it with a HOMER tool.  The tool will gather information on the wind, solar (global horizontal), elevation, and location to send to HOMER for analysis.  The tool will accept some user inputs and display a summary of the analysis results.  The user also has the option of opening the completed analysis directly in the HOMER application for additional options (using the \"Open HOMER File\" button).  Hydro data (if available) can be displayed in the tool window, but is not used by HOMER in its system optimization at this point.\r\nWhen the GsT is installed, it will also install the separate HOMER application with a 6 month license. After 6 months, the HOMER license will expire and the separate HOMER application will no longer run analyses.  THE LICENSE EXPIRATION WILL ONLY IMPACT THE \"Open HOMER File\" FUNCTIONALITY. The GsT will continue to run as usual and the \"Start HOMER\" button will continue to work.  However, when you click the \"Open HOMER File\" button, HOMER will only open files for \r\nviewing - you will no longer be able to make the HOMER application run an analysis.\r\nThe HOMER license can be renewed for free over the \r\ninternet.  You can renew your HOMER license and find out more about HOMER at this web address:\r\nhttp://www.nrel.gov/homer\r\n\r\nAdditional Data Development\r\n---------------------------\r\nMonthly Wind Resource Data:  The existing annual wind resource dataset has been expanded to include average wind speed and power for each month, annual average Weibull K shape parameter, annual average autocorrelation coefficient, and the annual diurnal pattern, peak hour, and pattern strength.  These parameters are needed for HOMER to synthesize an hourly wind speed for a representative year (8760 hours).\r\n\r\nHydro Resource Data:  A hydro resource dataset was developed as a separate task for SARI/E, and the results of that assessment have been incorporated for display within the GsT.  The hydro resource assessment provides annual and monthly estimates of average potential hydro power (kW).  The data was developed focusing on small hydro systems with small diversion distances, returning water to the stream within 200 m of the diversion point.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe GsT was completely redesigned and re-released in November 2010 to provide a more modern, easier-to-use interface with considerably faster analytical querying capabilities. The revised version of the Geospatial Toolkit for Sri Lanka is available using the following link:  http://www.nrel.gov/international/downloads/gst_srilanka.exe\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please use the provided link to access the most up to date software package and data.  The Sri Lanka GsT data were last updated in January 2011.  The attached zip file below is an archive and contains the previous version of the geospatial toolkit executable that has been replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease visit [Geospatial Toolkit](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Geospatial_Toolkit) for additional information about the GsT and updates.",
