    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In comparison to stereovision, it is well known that structured-light illumination has distinct advantages including the use of only one camera, being significantly less sensitive to background clutter, and not requiring the target object to have nonambiguous features. But because structured-light illumination requires a scanning process, it is inappropriate for humancomputer interfacing where the movements/gestures of a human subject are of interest. We propose the innovative process of composite pattern design as a means of constructing structured-light illumination patterns that measure surface topologies with only a single image and, thereby, are appropriate for recording real-time depth video. By moving the composite pattern into the Near-Infra-Red wavelength light spectrum and coupling with real-time optical processor, we intend to establish feasibility of a real-time, low latency, ambient light resistant, and high accuracy depth video sensor for producing a depth map of a scene applicable to virtual reality interfaces that permit control of robotic systems through human gestures by way of spatial tracking of user appendages in motion absent any wearable transmitters or markers.",
