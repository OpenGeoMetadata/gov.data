  "notes": " The new SWFSC laboratory in La Jolla incorporates a large sea- and fresh-water Ocean Technology Development Tank. This world-class facility expands NOAA&amp;#39;s ability to develop and apply advanced technologies for surveys of fisheries resources and their associated ecosystems and to foster collaborations on fisheries management issues. The new facility enables the SWFSC to continue its pioneering work in the development and use of acoustical and optical technologies for non-lethal surveys of protectedand managed species (mammals, fishes and turtles) and for the detection of near-surface fish schools (such as sardine) during ship-based surveys. The tank also supports ecosystem-based fisheries management through new and innovative uses of technologies, including novel platforms for deploying optical and acoustic sensors, such as inexpensive instrumented buoys andsmall craft, remotely operated vehicles (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), gliders, untethered profilers, drifters and floats. This unique research facility will allow NOAA to createthe next generation of technologies essential for achieving its current and future missions. It will also enhance collaborations with the community of scientists, both locally, at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and around the globe,to developthe next generation of fisheries and oceanographic instrumentation. An Ocean Technology Development Tank will provide a controlled environment to develop, test, and calibrate these technologies before deploying them on routine surveys or at remote locations at sea.
