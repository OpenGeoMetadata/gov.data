    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Using biologically-inspired neuromorphic optic flow algorithms is a novel approach in collision avoidance for UAS. Traditional computer vision algorithms rely on solving nonlinear partial differential equation systems to estimate optic flow which is a computationally expensive task. Neuromorphic algorithms instead make use of lessons learned in biology to solve these problems in a more efficient manner. An example is the fly&amp;#39;s motion detector, which can be modeled by a system that uses a set of locally calculated, parallel spatio-temporal correlations for a set of velocities determined by the input sampling rates and flying speeds. Correlation results are interpreted as likelihood for a motion direction and speed. Stages of obstacle detection and tracking can temporally and spatially integrate these likelihoods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn the detection rate. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed neuromorphic solution is more stable and noise tolerant than solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Even if single computational nodes get corrupted due to functional or structural failures in the hardware, the performance of appropriately designed parallel, distributed neuromorphic algorithms degrades gracefully. Neuromorphic algorithms are commonly implemented using software running on general-purpose multicore/graphic processing unit systems. This approach, though flexible, can have significant overhead in terms of power, performance, and is not easily portable across platforms, therefore reducing its scope of applicability. In the second phase, we will port the neuromorphic algorithms to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application specific integrated chips (ASICs). This will allow us to meet demanding performance requirements needed in UAS such as fast processing, low weight, low power consumption, as well as robustness to hardware failure.&lt;/p&gt;",
