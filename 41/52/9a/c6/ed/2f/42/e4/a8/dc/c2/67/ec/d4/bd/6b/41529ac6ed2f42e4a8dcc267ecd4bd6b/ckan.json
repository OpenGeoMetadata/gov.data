  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 50x50 meter cell size representing the slope of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from singlebeam SoNar data collected in 2000 by the NOAA Ship Whiting. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, as well as the NOAA Ship Whiting, and private sector partners, acquired singlebeam bathymetry data off the Charleston Bump from 03/25/2000 to 03/28/2000. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad Singlebeam echosounder. It was processed by interpolating a bathymetrical surface from feature class points using the spatial analyst natural neighbor tool with 9 neighbor cell radius. The raster surface was exported as a 50m GeoTiff and the slope was derived by using the ESRI ArcMap10 Spatial Analyst Slope tool.",
