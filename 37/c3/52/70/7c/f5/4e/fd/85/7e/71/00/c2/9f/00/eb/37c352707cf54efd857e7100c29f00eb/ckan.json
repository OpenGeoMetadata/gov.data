    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Two-phase heat rejection offers vast potential in reducing the thermal control footprint of vehicles and equipment in terms of mass, volume, and parasitic power loss. This potential follows from the latent heat associated with phase change: in order to remove the same heat as a single phase water loop having a 20C temperature rise, a two-phase loop needs only 5&#37; the flow rate, and consequently 3 orders of magnitude lesser pumping power, while simultaneously providing a constant heat rejection temperature.&lt;br /&gt;A key issue in consideration of two-phase, however, is predicting behavior in partial and micro-gravity environments. Recent research indicates that the performance of forced boiling in constrained channels, e.g. micro-channels or micro- heat exchangers, is not affected by the presence or lack of gravity. This is a consequence of a characteristic length scale small enough that surface tension forces dominate flow behavior rather than buoyancy forces which dominate at conventional scales. This project proposes to demonstrate a pumped two-phase cooling loop, e.g. one that collects heat from heat sources through forced micro-channel boiling, mitigating unknowns of microgravity boiling, and does not employ a compressed vapor phase.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
