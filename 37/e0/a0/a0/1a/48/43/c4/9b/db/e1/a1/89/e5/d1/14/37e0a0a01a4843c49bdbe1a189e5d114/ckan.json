    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides measurements for diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, distance from tree stems to the furthest canopy element, and a species survey of secondary forests in Para and Rondonia, Brazil, from 2002-2003. The forest areas were defined as Type A and Type B stands. Measurements were made in the overstory, understory, and midstory of each stand. Type A stands were sampled intensively, with the goal of providing high-fidelity spatial information about the 3-dimensional structure of the stand. These stands were 60 x 60-m (0.36-ha) areas divided into 10 x 10-m grids of uniform clearing and abandonment history and were identifiable from Landsat images. Type B stands were sampled extensively, with the goal of providing unbiased estimates of biomass, along with some information about the vertical structure of the stand and of spatial variability. These stands were polygons of uniform clearing and afforestation history based on multitemporal Landsat imagery, and varied in size and shape. The Landsat files provide classified land cover for each scene and can be used as a time series to evaluate land cover change over time. Each Landsat file is a geolocated land cover map based on 30-m Landsat data. NOTE: There were additional files which could not be archived due to file problems. Data Quality Statement: The Data Center has determined that this data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation resulting in diminished usability of this product. Known Problems: Some unresolved issues remain where data values are inconsistent with the variable descriptions provided with the data set. The site identification and plot identification values are not consistently used in all three data files. The variables are not adequately described.",
