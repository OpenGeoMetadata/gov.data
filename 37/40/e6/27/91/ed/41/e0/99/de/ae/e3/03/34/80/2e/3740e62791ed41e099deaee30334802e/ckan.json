    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current NASA programs, such as Adaptable, Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) and Woven Thermal Protection Systems (WTPS) are looking to fill a gap in ablative TPS for future missions to Venus and Saturn, human missions beyond Lunar, and Mars Sample Return Missions.  Both of these programs rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations. While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials. Materials Research &amp; Design (MR&amp;D) has experience in working with and designing 3D woven preforms for use in composite material reinforcement and has developed a suite of analytical tools to define the detailed geometry of 3D woven preforms for use in calculating material properties.  However, these tools currently do not have the capability to predict material strengths.  Within the proposed Phase I effort, MR&amp;D will enhance the existing tool by incorporating the ability to calculate material strengths of 3D weaves.  Strength predictions will be made for two different 3D woven hybrid preform reinforced phenolic panels and compared to measured test data for validation.",
