    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The term Automated Contingency Management (ACM) has been used to describe intelligent systems capable of mission re-planning and control reconfiguration in the presence of a current health state diagnosis. While a diagnostics driven ACM capability designed to optimize multi-objective performance criteria remains a significant technical challenge, it cannot hope to overcome the fact that it will always be a reactive paradigm. This paper, therefore, introduces an automated contingency management paradigm based on both current heath state (diagnosis) and future health state estimates (prognosis). Including Prognostics in the control loop poses at least two additional challenges to ACM. First, future state prediction will, in general, have uncertainty that increases as the prediction horizon increases so adaptive prognosis routines that manage uncertainty are critical. Secondly, a warning period afforded by prognosis allows ACM to be split into a real- time “reactive” component and a non-real time “planning” component that considers temporal parameters and the potential impact of being proactive with mitigating action. The proactive ACM paradigm was developed and evaluated in the context of a generic mono-propellant system model in Simulink/Stateflow with diagnostics, prognostics and an optimal reconfigurable control system. Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in prognostics enhanced ACM system are briefly discussed. Preliminary results from the on-going research work are presented and the paper is concluded with remarks on future work.",
