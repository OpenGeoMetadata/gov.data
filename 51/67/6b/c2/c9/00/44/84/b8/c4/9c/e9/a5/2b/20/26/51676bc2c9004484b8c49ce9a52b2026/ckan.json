  "notes": "This data set is comprised of lidar point cloud data. This project required lidar data to be acquired over Horry County, South Carolina. The total area of the Horry County Elevation Data and Imagery AOI is approximately 1092 square miles. Lidar data was collected and processed to meet the requirements of the project task order. The lidar collection was a collaborative effort between two data acquisition firms. While Woolpert was responsible for collection of the majority of the county, the coastal portion of the data was collected by Quantum Geospatial and is detailed in the processing steps of the metadata. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, four (4) foot pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow. The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly. One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 2.5 feet. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value. During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. The data received by the NOAA OCM are topographic data in LAS 1.2 format, classified as unclassified (1), ground (2), all noise (7), water (9), ignored ground (10), overlap unclassified (17), and overlap ground (18). Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and breakline data are also available. The DEM data are available at: ftp://coast.noaa.gov/pub/DigitalCoast/lidar1_z/geoid12b/data/4814/DEMs/ The breakline data are available at: ftp://coast.noaa.gov/pub/DigitalCoast/lidar1_z/geoid12b/data/4814/breaklines Any conclusions drawn from the analysis of this information are not the responsibility of NOAA, the Office of Coastal Management (OCM)or its partners.",
