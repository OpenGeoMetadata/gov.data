  "notes": "This data set contains photographic information obtained for the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and is comprised of scanned photographs that were acquired on color positive film. Acquisition was leaf-on with mature crops prior to harvest. Images have been orthorectified. NAIP imagery is quarter-quadrangle centered to provide consistent and repeatable coverage. The quarter-quad photos have been mosaicked into MrSID format county files. (Note that the Farm Services Agency provided one metadata record per MrSID county file; the Land Management Information Center created this metadata record to describe the whole data set. For information that FSA did not provide, the metadata for Minnesota's NAIP 2002 imagery can serve as a general guide to the NAIP program procedure -- some of the specific processing steps or accuracy assessments may differ from the 2003 program: http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip02.html )",
