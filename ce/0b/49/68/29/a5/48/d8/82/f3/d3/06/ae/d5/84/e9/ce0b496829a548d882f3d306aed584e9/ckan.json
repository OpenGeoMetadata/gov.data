    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "MicroLink Devices will increase the efficiency of multi-junction solar cells by designing and demonstrating advanced anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) that will provide a better broadband spectral response than that of conventional anti-reflection coatings.  Advanced coatings of this nature are needed to realize the full performance of the forthcoming generation of multi-junction solar cells, which will contain four or more junctions.  Two approaches to improving the performance of the antireflection coatings will be investigated: \r\n\r\n*  develop multilayer dielectric antireflection coatings incorporating LaTiO3 to achieve significantly improved optical coupling between the coverglass and cell at the ultraviolet and infrared ends of the spectral range of interest; and \r\n*  develop a structure and corresponding fabrication process to oxidize the Al-containing window layer in order to reduce the absorption of light at the short-end of the spectral range of interest, thus providing extra useable photons to the cell.   \r\n\r\nThese two technologies will be integrated into a hybrid design which will provide the best possible coupling of light from cover glass to cell in order to achieve the highest possible efficiency in next-generation devices containing four or more junctions.  It is expected that the new coatings will enable a relative efficiency increase of at least 7&#37;, corresponding to a 2.5&#37; absolute efficiency increase.  The reliability and radiation tolerance of these materials and the solar cells incorporating the new designs will be tested.",
