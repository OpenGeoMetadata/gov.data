  "notes": "The database represents aspen stand locations and field assessments conducted in the Eldorado National Forest, Eldorado and Amador Counties, California. Data was gathered during the summers of 1999-2001. Assessments were conducted primarily by volunteers for the USDA Forest Service. Assessments were conducted within known aspen stands in the region, or stands identified during field surveys. The survey method was not intended to capture all known aspen sites in this region, and so this data does not represent a comprehensive map of aspen stands in the region. Aspen stands were assessed using a protocol developed by the Eldorado National Forest. Basic Information gathered included location and vegetative characteristics, and if browsing of the aspen was present or absent. Associated with this point layer is a polygon layer (ELDORADO_NF_POLY) containing aspen stands delineated in conjunction with the aspen assessment information. Data Compilation: The Aspen Delineation Project (ADP) is a collaborative effort of the U.S. Forest Service's Pacific Southwest Region, the California Department of Fish and Games Resource Assessment Program, and the California Office of Bureau of Land Management. Principal Investigator for ADP is David Burton; visit: www.aspensite.org for more information regarding the ADP. The Department of Fish and Games, Resource Assessment Program compiled this information from the collaborating agencies and other researchers, and formatted the data into a common database for the purpose of facilitating access to data related to the conservation of Quaking Aspen in California. This information portal falls within the ADP goals to help agencies and land managers identify, map, treat, and monitor aspen habitats. This dataset is a portion of a master database compiled during a year long effort in 2005 to pull together current GIS layers and maps depicting Aspen communities in California.",
