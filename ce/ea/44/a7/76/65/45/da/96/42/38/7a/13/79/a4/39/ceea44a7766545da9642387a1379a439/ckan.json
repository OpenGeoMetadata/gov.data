    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Remote Sensing Solutions proposes to develop the Network-based Parallel Retrieval Onboard Computing Environment for Sensor Systems (nPROCESS) for deployment on NASA's unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  The nPROCESS will provide a compact, efficient, reconfigurable computing environment that will achieve unparalleled real-time data processing, acquisition and distribution to provide new observations and improved sensitivity; provide a test-bed for measurement and algorithm development and testing for future mission risk reduction and demonstration; produce critical information for real-time decision making; and facilitate a path to reduce risks and installation / operational costs for deployment of new and existing sensors on NASA UAS platforms.  The proposed innovations to realize nPROCESS are: (1) reconfigurable, object orientated system architecture that will provides far greater customization and expansion, (2) modularity at the hardware, firmware and software levels to adapt to the sensors needs at minimum cost and (3) high fidelity parallel processing and data distribution capabilities. Deployed with the HIWRAP on the NASA Global Hawk, nPROCESS will provide higher quality and real-time mapping of the three-dimensional wind profiles, ocean vector surface maps and precipitation winds within tropical cyclones.",
