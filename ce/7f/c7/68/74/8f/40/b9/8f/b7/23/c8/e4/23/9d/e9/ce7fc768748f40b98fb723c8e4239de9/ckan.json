    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The innovation of the PEGASES concept is the simplification of gridded ion technology and elimination of the neutralization requirement through negative gas propellant utilization and alternating accelerating potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional EP is an enabling technology for a wide range of missions.&amp;nbsp; The currently available solutions include conventional gridded-ion thrusters and Hall thrusters.&amp;nbsp; For science, the Dawn mission used EP to enable a single science instrument suite to rendezvous with two distinct targets within a Discovery class mission.&amp;nbsp; Electron collisions are used to ionize a heavy gas (e.g. xenon) and accelerate the positive xenon ions using an electrostatic field and then an external cathode is used to neutralize the exhaust. Gridded-ion thrusters have three independent feed system elements for the discharge (ionization) cathode, the main propellant flow, and the neutralization cathode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a strong push within the planetary community to move to Hall thrusters because gridded-ion thrusters are considered unaffordable within the Discovery mission cost cap without additional incentive funding. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, the market has been driving nearly all EP solutions to Hall thrusters due to the higher thrust-to-power potential and reduced system complexity (i.e. cost).&amp;nbsp; Hall thrusters have two independent feed system elements for the main propellant flow (though the anode) and the cathode.&amp;nbsp; The basic principle of operation is similar to that of a gridded-ion thruster.&amp;nbsp; However, instead of grids, a magnetic field is used to trap electrons via the Hall Effect which creates an electrostatic field and functions as a grid-less ion engine.&amp;nbsp; The electron source is an external cathode also used for neutralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall thrusters are typically lower efficiency than gridded-ion thrusters, but the reduced complexity, cost, and higher thrust-to-power make then attractive.&amp;nbsp; While they operate at 5-10&#37; lower efficiency, they still offer an order of magnitude increase in specific impulse over chemical alternatives.&amp;nbsp; Consider the Dawn spacecraft will obtain 12km/s ?V from the NSTAR thruster with ~400kg of Xenon and is comparable to the ?V from ~200,000kg propellant of the launch vehicle.&amp;nbsp; A Hall thruster would require closer to 450kg of propellant, but reduce the total spacecraft cost by $15M; a significant fraction for a Discovery mission vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community continues to investigate evolutionary concepts on both the gridded-ion and Hall thruster technologies. Center level and program level technology funding has been applied to investigate alternative grid materials, new magnetic field topologies, alternative cathode emitter materials, alternative propellants, etc. However, the PEGASES concept is revolutionary by eliminating all cathodes and leveraging an electronegative gas to produce both positive and negative ions.&amp;nbsp; In the proposed thruster, one of the grids is alternately biased to achieve thrust from both the positive and negative species. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The resulting electronegative gas thrusters only have one feed element, and can leverage an RF source to generate both positive and negative ions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The advantages of the PEGASES concept include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating the dependence on cathodes sensitive to propellant contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Propellant cost reduction; 99.5&#37; purity is 80&#37; lower cost than 99.999&#37;; ~$M per mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Propellant handling and loading costs / process simplification; &amp;gt;$M per mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing recombination speed over ions and electrons (i.e. reduced spacecraft plume interactions)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing charge exchange erosion (i.e. increase grid life)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating of two additional feed system lines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating of external neutralization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost Enabling gridded-ion technology for Small spacecraft&lt;/p&gt;",
