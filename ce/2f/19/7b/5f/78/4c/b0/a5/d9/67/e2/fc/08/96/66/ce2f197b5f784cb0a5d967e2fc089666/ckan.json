  "notes": "  The Energy Materials Research Laboratory at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) creates a cross-disciplinary laboratory facility that lends itself to the integration of research and application of advanced materials that is focused on major laboratory and national initiatives. It drives innovation in advanced materials, either through fundamental changes or simple refinements in polymeric, ceramic, electronic, or metallic materials and materials systems in support of current and emerging national energy technology initiatives. This multi-disciplinary laboratory develops and fosters collaborations with academic, private industry and the government to develop and implement basic and applied research activities within the defined Strategic Thrusts for SRNL, and acts as an enduring resource for new high-technology, highly-skilled workforce development for both SRNL and the nation. EMRL leverages breakthroughs in materials science and technology to ensure the most effective solutions to support national DOE initiatives in transformational sustainable energy technologies and infrastructure missions. SRNL&amp;#39;s core competency in materials science and its position as a premier applied science laboratory makes it an ideal agent to help develop and transition materials science technologies to these end applications.   Objectives   Conduct Cutting Edge Materials Research to Develop Clean, Sustainable Energy Technologies Attract and Develop New Research for Clean, Sustainable Energy Research  Focus  Focal point areas for advanced materials science and technology development will center on the following:  Synthesis, characterization, and performance testing of advanced materials in support of a broad spectrum of energy technologies Energy storage materials and systems Solar energy materials Materials for wind and marine energy systems Novel materials and processes for CO2 capture and reuse Nuclear energy technologies  ",
