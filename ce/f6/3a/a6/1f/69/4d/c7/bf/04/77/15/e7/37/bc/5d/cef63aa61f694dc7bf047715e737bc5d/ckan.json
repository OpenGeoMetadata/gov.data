    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hypersonic aircraft are subjected to extreme conditions with respect to mechanical thermal and acoustic loads. Materials with complex microstructure, such as Functionally Graded (FGM) and honeycomb, are expected to play a key role in such vehicles. Detailed numerical stress and thermal analysis of such materials, with conventional Finite Element Methods (FEM), is extremely difficult. The Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM) is a very promising candidate for carrying out such calculations efficiently and accurately. This is an O(N) method (where N is the size of a problem) with respect to both matrix formulation and solution of linear systems.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that two user-friendly software packages based on the FMBEM, to be called AvantFGM and AvantHoneycomb, will be developed in this proposed Phase I project. These packages will be used to carry out mechanical and thermal characterization of these complex materials. The output of these packages will deliver material properties as functions of spatial coordinates, which can then be used to carry out conventional FEM analyses of aircraft components of complex geometrical shape.\r\n\r\nPlans for Phase II call for development of fully functioning commercial software capable of analyzing many realistic situations pertaining to hypersonic aircraft. Phase III will be concerned with further development of the software to include damage accumulation (due to, for example, mechanical, creep and thermo-acoustic fatigue) and risk analysis.\r\n",
