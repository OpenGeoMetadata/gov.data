    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;We plan to develop a blackbody coated with Carbon nanotube materials that will able to operate in the temperature ranges need to calibrate a thermal infrared sensor for Earth Science missions. The carbon based nanotube material, developed through the NASA GSFC IRAD, will be evaluated as a surface treatment for onboard blackbody calibrators (OBCs). The aforementioned material can reduce stray light that can be introduced into an instrument from an OBC and effect the integrity of the data at is be collected. Also, a sufficiently uniform coating will simplify the geometry of the target, which reduces development time, manufacturing time, and cost of the OBC. Silicon has been determined to be an acceptable growth medium for the carbon nanotube coating. We will evaluate the effect of the paint/substrate layer thickness will have on the thermal gradient to see if we get the desired emissivity. Also, we want to verify that the thermal mass is sufficient to hold a stable thermal temperature. Once the OBC system is defined, a ray trace study will be conducted to assess the emissivity off the blackbody and the irradiance. The final product, an OBC performance model, could eventually be used as a tool to size a blackbody calibrator for future missions, such as a thermal imager for a future Landsat mission, the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on the next generation Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and the thermal infrared instrument that has been proposed for Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI).&lt;/p&gt;",
