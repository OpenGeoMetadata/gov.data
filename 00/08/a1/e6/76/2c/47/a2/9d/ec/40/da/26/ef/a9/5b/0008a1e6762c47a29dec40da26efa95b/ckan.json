The polygon boundaries are approximate since the U.S. Postal Service assigns zip codes to linear features (streets), not to geographic areas. Since neither the U.S. Postal Service nor the U.S. Census Bureau maintains official zip code boundary files or maps, LMIC created this file in order to be able to map data aggregated by zip code. LMIC worked with regional post office sites to delineate areas within which letter carriers delivered mail with the same zip code.",
