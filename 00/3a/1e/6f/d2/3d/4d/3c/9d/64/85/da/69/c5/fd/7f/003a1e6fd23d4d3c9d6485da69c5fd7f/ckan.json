  "notes": "There was no metadata record provided along with this data set. Much of the information in this record, has been gleaned from the metadata record for a data set from this same project, for data collected in March of 2006. The minimal amount of known information that is specific to this data set has been included in this record where possible. This lidar point data set was collected during low tide conditions along an approximately 500-700 meter wide strip of the Southern California coastline within an area extending south from Long Beach to the US/Mexico border. Data were collected in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties in October 2006. Data set features include water, beach, cliffs, and top of cliffs. The all points data set contains the complete point cloud of first and last return elevation and laser intensity measurements recorded during the fall 2006 airborne lidar survey conducted semi-annually by the University of Texas at Austin for the Southern California Beach Processes Study. Data represented is all points including terrain, vegetation, and structures. This data also contains returns from the water surface. No processing has been done to remove returns from terrain, vegetation, structures, or water surfaces. The data set was generated by the processing of laser range, scan angle, and aircraft attitude data collected using an Optech Inc. Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) 1225 in combination with geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) airborne and ground-based receivers. The system was installed in a twin engine Partenavia P-68 (tail number N3832K) owned and operated by Aspen Helicopter, Inc. The lidar data set described by this document was collected in October of 2006. The 99d118 instrument settings for these flights were: laser pulse rate: 25 kHz scanner rate: 26 Hz, scan angle: +/- 20 deg beam divergence: narrow altitude: 300-600m AGL ground speed: 95-120kts",
