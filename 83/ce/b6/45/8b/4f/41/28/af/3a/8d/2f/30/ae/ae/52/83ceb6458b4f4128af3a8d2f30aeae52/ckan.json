    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The THIRN4IMCH67 data product consists of daily montages of brightness temperatures on 70 mm photofacsimile film strips from the Nimbus-4 Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer measured at 6.7 microns. Daytime and nighttime orbital swaths are displayed in strips, each corresponding to a distance approximately from pole to pole and a width from horizon to horizon. The ground resolution of 22.6 km at nadir decreases as the horizontal distance from the subsatellite track increases. Each film strip is gridded with geographic coordinates and is identified by orbit number, time, and an indication of whether it is daytime (D) or nighttime (N). The images are saved as JPEG 2000 digital files. About 1 week of images are archived into a TAR file. Additional information can be found in section 3.4.1 of \"The Nimbus IV User's Guide\". \n\nThe Nimbus 4 Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) was designed to detect emitted thermal radiation in both the 10.5- to 12.5-micrometer region (IR window) and the 6.5- to 7.0-micrometer region (water vapor). The window channel measured cloudtop temperatures day and night. The other channel operated primarily at night to map the water vapor distribution in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The THIR experiment made measurements from April 18, 1970 until April 8, 1971.These images can be used to supplement the radiance data files from the THIRN2L2CH67 data product.",
