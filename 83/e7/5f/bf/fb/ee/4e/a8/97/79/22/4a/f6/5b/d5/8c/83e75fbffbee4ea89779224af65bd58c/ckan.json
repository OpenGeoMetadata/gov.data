    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed Wireless, passive, SAW sensor system operates in a\nmulti-sensor environment with a range in excess of 45 feet. This\nproposed system offers unique features in two (2) important areas. The\nfirst is in the development of a new sensor type, a strain gauge that is\nbased on OFC techniques and implemented with the low loss\ncharacteristics of SAW Unidirectional transducers. The second is in the\ndesign of an integrated interrogator system that has DSP-based embedded\nsignal processing. Interrogator will also be capable of rapidly\nperforming multiple interrogations which can them be used to make\nibration measurements or averaged to extend the operational range of the\nsystem. This proposal extends the Phase I and previous work in two major\nareas; developing a SAW strain sensor, and dramatically increasing\ninterrogation range, which is applicable to both the new strain sensors\nand the previously developed temperature sensors.  In order to increase\nSAW sensor range, sensitivity and accuracy, the most important device\nparameters were identified and initial investigation begun in Phase I\nand will be put into practice in Phase II. To reduce SAW sensor loss and\nminimize multi-transit acoustic echoes, low loss unidirectional studies\nwere initiated.  Phase I produced three alternative low-loss approaches\nthat will be evaluated in the Phase II work.  Success will lower the\ninsertion loss by approximately 15 dB, and multi-transit echoes are\npredicted to be less than -40 dB from the main signal; doubling the\nsystem range and reducing the sensors self-noise.  Advanced coding\ntechniques were investigated in Phase I that have led to longer delay\npath lengths, and shorter codes with less inter-sensor  interference.\nDuring Phase II, the interrogator will improve the following critical\ncapabilities: onboard-fully-integrated DSP, extended connectivity\noptions to customer's computer, and rapid interrogation capabilities.\nThis will allow vibration sensing and signal integration.",
