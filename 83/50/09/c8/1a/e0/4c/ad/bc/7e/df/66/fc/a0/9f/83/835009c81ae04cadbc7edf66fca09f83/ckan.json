    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Accurate CFD modeling of fuel/oxidizer injection and combustion is needed to design and analyze liquid rocket engines.  Currently, however, there is no mature modeling capability for liquid fuel/oxidizer injectors in LOCI-Chem, used by NASA and its contractors to analyze rocket engines. In this STTR, an innovative, high fidelity injection module will be developed that features the Level Set (LS) interface tracking method coupled with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR).  In addition to tracking liquid atomization for subcritical flows, the module will have the capability to model transcritical and supercritical regimes, as well as transient and steady operating conditions in a cryogenic engine combustion chamber.  CFDRC will team with Mississippi State University to develop the proposed unified module in LOCI-Chem.  To show feasibility, the Phase I effort will implement the LS method to track liquid-gas interfaces, and resolve the primary atomization of liquid jets in a subcritical environment.  Validation will be performed using the shear coaxial LN2/GN2 jet data of AFRL (Edwards AFB).  In Phase II, the LS module will be coupled with the Lagrangian spray model in LOCI-Chem in order to completely track the spray. AMR capability will be developed and integrated with the LS module to improve LS's liquid mass conservation accuracy.  Models for secondary atomization and drop vaporization will be implemented in Phase II, in addition to thermodynamic models to capture transcritical and supercritical combustion.  Final demonstration of the software will include validation against practical liquid propellant injector cases selected in consultation with NASA personnel.",
