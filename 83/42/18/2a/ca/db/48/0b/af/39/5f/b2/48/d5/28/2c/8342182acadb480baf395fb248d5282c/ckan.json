    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tWhat causes the Sun to vary? The Sun gives off magnetic fields, bulk plasma (the solar wind) and energetic particles moving up to nearly the speed of light, and all of these vary spatially and temporally. The three dimensional structure of solar wind turbulence, coronal mass ejections (CME) and magnetic clouds can only be understood with concurrent, multipoint measurements. Rapid advancements in CubeSat technology and the NASA OCT funding of Interplanetary CubeSats has opened the possibility of developing a flotilla of tiny spacecraft carrying magnetometers or simple plasma instruments to conduct these investigations. CubeSats are already demonstrating their cost effectiveness in Earth orbit. Heliophysics is a particularly fruitful field for extension of CubeSats to interplanetary constellations because many scientific investigations can only be accomplished with concurrent, spatially distributed measurements and the fields and particles instrumentation may fit within CubeSat volume constraints. While many CubeSat subsystems developed for Earth orbit are directly applicable to interplanetary mission, many subsystems will have to be totally redesigned to meet the requirements of deep space missions. This workshop will identify the scientific investigations enabled by a flotilla of small instruments in Earth-trailing and Earth-leading orbits. It will outline a mission concept and the technology challenges of the instruments and spacecraft systems necessary to conduct these investigations. This new approach, a flotilla of simple instruments, could help NASA develop a new approach to heliophysics research.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
