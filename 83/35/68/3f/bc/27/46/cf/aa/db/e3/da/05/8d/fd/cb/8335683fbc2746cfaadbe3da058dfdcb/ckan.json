    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/precipitation/trmm_instr.shtml is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. \n\nThe Level 1B product file (1B11) contains calibrated brightness temperatures and auxiliary geolocation information for each pixel in the scan. The structure of the Level 1B data file is based on the Wentz format for the SSM/I data. The Level 1B data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the TMI measurements. A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 14 MB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS \"swath\" structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. As in the case of the Level 1A data, there are 16 files of TMI 1B11 data produced per day.\n\nAntenna temperatures are derived from the Level 1A sensor counts by applying a linear relationship of the form: Tb = a + b * count. The resultant temperatures are corrected for cross-polarization and spill-over to produce the brightness temperatures found in the Level 1B product. However, no antenna beam pattern correction or ample-to-pixel averaging has been applied to these brightness temperatures.\n\nIn the Level 1B data, geolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan, whereas the time stamp, scan status (containing scan quality information), navigation, calibration coefficients, and satellite zenith angle are specified on a per-scan basis. There are, in general, 2991 scans along the orbit, with each scan consisting of 208 high resolution (85 GHz) pixels, and 104 low resolution pixels (all other channels). The scan width is about 760 km.\n\nSpatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.",
