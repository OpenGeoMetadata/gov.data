  "notes": "The 2015 cartographic boundary KMLs are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master\n                                 Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are\n                                 specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the\n                                 hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year.\n                                 Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others\n                                 are available only as state-based files.\n\n                                 The records in this file allow users to map the parts of Urban Areas that overlap a particular county.\n\n                                 After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing\n                                 residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses.  In general, this territory consists of areas of high population\n                                 density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the \"urban footprint.\"  There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas\n                                 (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people\n                                 (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000).  Each urban area\n                                 is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.\n\n                                 The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which\n                                 has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area,\n                                 census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four\n                                 states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county\n                                 organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are\n                                 treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and\n                                 each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as\n                                 equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa,\n                                 Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the\n                                 United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  \n\n                                 The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010.",
