    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides a time series of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes for five (Path/Row) areas in Rondonia, Brazil. The scenes are from the period June 1975 through June 2000, but all areas do not have scenes for all the years. The areas and Landsat Path/Rows included are as follows: Ariquemes (P232,R67), Ji-Parana (P231, R67), Luiza (P231, R68), Cacoal (P230, R68), and Porto Velho (P232, R66). TM images are available for all five areas. Because of a paucity of digital Landsat MSS imagery from the 1970s, only two scenes could be included, a 1975 scene from Ariquemes and a 1978 scene from Ji-Parana. Each of the Landsat scenes has been coregistered to a Path/Row-specific georectified PRODES Landsat file obtained from the Brazilian Government's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) program. For each scene, the coregistration is accurate to within (plus or minus)1 pixel (30-m Landsat resolution) in most places. The five INPE PRODES Landsat scenes used in the georectification process are included with this data set. There are five compressed files (tar.gz format) with this data set. When expanded, each compressed file (which corresponds to one of the five areas) contains a directory for each scene with GeoTIFF files for individual Landsat bands, a text file of tie points, and another text file of slope and intercept values for converting radiance to reflectance. There are two dates for Landsat MSS scenes, 45 dates for TM scenes, and six dates for ETM+ scenes.",
