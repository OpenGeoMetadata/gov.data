    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\nThe Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) level 2 Vector Magnetometer (VMAG) AC daily product contains the Vector Magnetic Field AC component.  PEM was flown on the UARS spacecraft to measure the type, amount, energy, and distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.\n\nThe VMAG DC magnetic field measurements are limited to frequencies less than 2.5 Hz by an 18 db/octave antialiasing filter.  Higher frequencies are measured with a peak detector and are the Vector Magnetic Field AC component.  The AC value is derived from each vector field component where the sensor output is pass band filtered from 2.5 to 50 Hz.  The resultant signal is then half wave rectified and passed to an RC circuit with a time constant of 4.7 s.  The voltage across the RC circuit is the peak detector output which therefore represents the peak positive amplitude of the 2.5-50 Hz filtered sensor output occurring during the previous 5 seconds; however, the peak detector is determined at a rate of about every second (the VMAG AC data has been adjusted for this time offset).  The X and Z peak detectors have full scale of 1oo nT peak to peak (= 5 Volts) and the Y peak detector has a full scale of 10 nT peak to peak (= 5 Volts).  The analog 0 to 5 Volts peak detector outputs are sent directly to the PEM central electronics package where they are digitized into a 265 binary word.  This is the raw value in the data.  No in-flight calibration of the AC peak detection electronics is provided. The VMAG unit is located on the zenith boom of UARS.\n                        \nThere is one data file per day for the PEM VMAG AC product, and the temporal coverage is from Oct. 1, 1991 to Aug. 23, 2005. Spatial coverage for the VMAG AC product ranges between -57 and +57 deg latitude.  The VMAG AC data files are written in network binary format. For more information please review the PEM VMAG AC data format guide.",
