    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In the proposed project, we will formally verify the correctness of the interaction between a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and user processes under various operating scenarios, such as multitasking, interrupt handling, user and kernel mode switching. The formal verification will be done assuming execution on the PowerPC 750 architecture that is implemented in the radiation-hardened RAD750 flight-control computers utilized in many NASA space missions, and are planned to be used in future spacecraft, including the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. A unique advantage of our project will be that the formal verification will precisely account for the bit-level semantics of all instructions, as well as the memory system, the bus, and devices on the bus, including multiple CPUs, and thus will allow us to precisely analyze all possible behaviors of the entire system, which is critical for aerospace applications.\r\nDuring Phase I we will lay the foundation for Phase II by: developing initial models of the memory system and the bus; formally defining the bit-level semantics of additional instructions from the PowerPC 750 architecture that we have not specified yet; identifying properties that we will prove to guarantee correct interaction of user processes with the target RTOS, the memory system, and the bus, including scenarios such as multitasking, interrupt handling, user and kernel mode switching; proving some of these properties; and identifying the most promising directions for Phase II work.",
