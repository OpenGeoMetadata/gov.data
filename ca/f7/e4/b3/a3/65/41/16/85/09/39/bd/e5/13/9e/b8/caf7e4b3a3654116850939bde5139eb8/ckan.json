    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This archive of daily rawinsonde measurements of wind direction and\nspeed, atmospheric pressure, humidity, air temperature, and\ngeopotential height as well as surface-based observation of cloud\ncover (amount, type and height) from Soviet North Pole drifting\nstations was assembled under the direction of Dr. J. Kahl, with\nfunding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Electric Power Research\nInstitute. Soundings were recorded from April 19, 1954 to July 31,\n1990 at drifting stations located in the Arctic Ocean, north of\napproximately 70 degrees North. Data were obtained from several\ndifferent sources. All of these data are ultimately derived from the\nset of bound volumes of handwritten tables kept at the Arctic and\nAntarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg, Russia. Data\nare in 21 ASCII text format files with an average size of under 10 MB.\nThe data are available via ftp.\n",
