  "notes": "This map service displays all air-related layers used in the USEPA Community/Tribal-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C/T-FERST) mapping application (http://cfpub.epa.gov/cferst/index.cfm). The following data sources (and layers) are contained in this service: USEPA's 2005 National-Scale Air Toxic Assessment (NATA) data. Data are shown at the census tract level (2000 census tract boundaries, US Census Bureau) for Cumulative Cancer and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) from 139 air toxics. In addition, individual pollutant estimates of Ambient Concentration, Exposure Concentration, Cancer, and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) are provided for: Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Arsenic, Benzene, 1,3-Butadiene, Chromium, Diesel PM, Formaldehyde, Lead, Naphthalene, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH). The original Access tables were downloaded from USEPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/tables.html. The data classification (defined interval) for this map service was developed for USEPA's Office of Research and Development's (ORD) Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C-FERST) per guidance provided by OAR. The 2005 NATA provides information on 177 of the 187 Clean Air Act air toxics (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/2005polls.pdf) plus diesel particulate matter (diesel PM was assessed for non-cancer only). For additional information about NATA, go to http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/nata_tmd.pdf or contact Ted Palma, USEPA (palma.ted@epa.gov). NATA data disclaimer: USEPA strongly cautions that these modeling results are most meaningful when viewed at the state or national level, and should not be used to draw conclusions about local exposures or risks (e.g., to compare local areas, to identify the exact location of \"hot spots\", or to revise or design emission reduction programs). Substantial uncertainties with the input data for these models may cause the results to misrepresent actual risks, especially at the census tract level. However, we believe the census tract data and maps can provide a useful approximation of geographic patterns of variation in risk within counties. For example, a cluster of census tracts with higher estimated risks may suggest the existence of a \"hot spot,\" although the specific tracts affected will be uncertain. More refined assessments based on additional data and analysis would be needed to better characterize such risks at the tract level. (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/countyxls/cancer_risk02_county_042009.xls). Note that these modeled estimates are derived from outdoor sources only; indoor sources are not included in these examples, but may be significant in some cases. The modeled exposure estimates are for a median individual in the geographic area shown. Note that in some cases the estimated relationship between human exposure and health effect may be calculated as a high end estimate, and thus may be more likely to overestimate than underestimate actual health effects for the median individual in the geographic area shown. Other limitations to consider when looking at the results are detailed on the EPA 2005 NATA website. For these reasons, the NATA maps included in C-FERST are provided for screening purposes only. See the 2005 National Air Toxic Assessment website for recommended usage and limitations on the estimated cancer and noncancer data provided above. USEPA's NonAttainment areas data. C-FERST displays Ozone for 8-hour Ozone based on the 1997 standard for reporting and Particulate Matter PM-2.5 based on the 2006 standard for reporting. These are areas of the country where air pollution levels consistently exceed the national ambient air quality standards. Details about the USEPA's NonAttainment data are available at http://www.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Center of Disease Control's (CDC) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) data. Averaged over three years (2004 - 2006). The USEPA's ORD calculated a three-year average (2004 - 2006) using the values for Ozone (number of days with the maximum 8-hour average above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)) and PM 2.5 (annual ambient concentration). These data were extracted by the CDC from the USEPA's ambient air monitors and are displayed at the county level. USEPA received the Monitor and Modeled data from the CDC and calculated the three year average displayed in the web service.
