  "notes": "Three topics concerning trace element contamination in wildlife at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge are summarized below: Cadmium, chromium and mercury concentrations in colonial waterbirds and tree swallows at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge. Extremely high cadmium (Cd) concentrations and elevated mercury (Hg) and chromium (Cr) concentrations were reported in eggs and feathers of waterbirds nesting at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge (Agassiz) in 1994. Chromium concentrations in livers of immature Franklin’s gulls were also exceptionally high. To determine the effects of these metals on nesting birds at Agassiz, waterbird (Franklin’s gull, black-crowned night-heron, eared grebe, and pied-billed grebe), and tree swallow eggs and chicks were collected at Agassiz during 1998-2001 and analyzed for trace elements including Cd, Cr, and Hg. In contrast to the 1994 study, Cd and Cr concentrations were not elevated in waterbird or tree swallow eggs or chicks. Mercury concentrations in waterbird eggs from Agassiz were comparable or less than concentrations reported in 1994. Cadmium, Cr, and Hg concentrations in waterbirds and tree swallows nesting at Agassiz were not at toxic levels. Trace element concentrations in eggs and livers of colonial waterbirds and tree swallows following the 2000 pool drawdown at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge. Water drawdown is a management tool often used to improve the habitat quality of wetlands. Flooding of sediment can increase the production of methylmercury and increase its bioavailability. The main pool at Agassiz was drawn down in 2000. Waterbird and tree swallow eggs and chicks were collected at Agassiz in 1998, 1999, 2000 (tree swallows only), and 2001 to determine the potential effects of the 2000 drawdown on subsequent trace element concentrations. Trace elements, including mercury, did not increase in waterbirds and tree swallows following the 2000 drawdown at Agassiz. The lack of a mercury response in birds at Agassiz in 2001 may have been related to limited drying of Agassiz Pool during the 2000 drawdown. Trace elements in moose from northwestern Minnesota. The moose population in bog and forested areas of northwestern Minnesota has declined for over 25 years, and more recently the decline is throughout northwestern Minnesota. Both deficiencies and elevations in trace elements have been linked to the health of moose worldwide. The objective of this study was to measure trace element concentrations in livers of moose found dead in northwestern Minnesota and to determine either deficient or elevated levels. Livers of 81 moose found dead in northwestern Minnesota in 1998 and 1999 were analyzed for trace elements. With the exception of Se and Cu, trace elements were not at toxic or deficient levels based on criteria set for cattle. Selenium concentrations in moose livers were deficient in 18.5%, adequate to high in 65.5%, and at a chronic toxicity level in 16%. Copper concentrations were deficient in 39.5% of livers, marginally deficient in 29.5% of livers, and adequate in 31% of livers. Copper deficiency, which has been associated with population declines of moose in Alaska and Sweden, may be a factor contributing to the decline of moose in northwestern Minnesota.",
