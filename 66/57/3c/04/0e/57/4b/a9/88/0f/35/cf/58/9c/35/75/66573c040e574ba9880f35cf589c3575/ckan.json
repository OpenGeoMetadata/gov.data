    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "DATA MINING THE GALAXY ZOO MERGERS\r\n\r\nSTEVEN BAEHR*, ARUN VEDACHALAM*, KIRK BORNE*, AND DANIEL SPONSELLER*\r\n\r\nAbstract. Collisions between pairs of galaxies usually end in the coalescence (merger) of the two\r\ngalaxies. Collisions and mergers are rare phenomena, yet they may signal the ultimate fate of\r\nmost galaxies, including our own Milky Way. With the onset of massive collection of astronomical\r\ndata, a computerized and automated method will be necessary for identifying those colliding\r\ngalaxies worthy of more detailed study. This project researches methods to accomplish that goal.\r\nAstronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and human-provided classifications\r\non merger status from the Galaxy Zoo project are combined and processed with machine learning\r\nalgorithms. The goal is to determine indicators of merger status based solely on discovering those\r\nautomated pipeline-generated attributes in the astronomical database that correlate most strongly\r\nwith the patterns identified through visual inspection by the Galaxy Zoo volunteers. In the end,\r\nwe aim to provide a new and improved automated procedure for classification of collisions and\r\nmergers in future petascale astronomical sky surveys. Both information gain analysis (via the\r\nC4.5 decision tree algorithm) and cluster analysis (via the Davies-Bouldin Index) are explored as\r\ntechniques for finding the strongest correlations between human-identified patterns and existing\r\ndatabase attributes. Galaxy attributes measured in the SDSS green waveband images are found to\r\nrepresent the most influential of the attributes for correct classification of collisions and mergers.\r\nOnly a nominal information gain is noted in this research, however, there is a clear indication of\r\nwhich attributes contribute so that a direction for further study is apparent.",
