    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Until the former NIAC was closed, we had investigated a nano-meter accuracy formation flight method based on photon thrusters and tethers, Photon Tether Formation Flight (PTFF), with the maximum baseline distance over 10 km for the next generation NASA space missions. Since photons have extremely small thrust per power, thrust amplification by recycling photons between two high reflectance mirrors located separately in two pairing satellites was proposed to overcome the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our original emphasis was on propellant-free nanometer accuracy tethered formation flying, however, during our study on photon thruster demonstration, we discovered that our photon thruster (Photonic Laser Thruster, PLT) has a much larger potential in NASA mission applications than precision tethered formation flying. The potential resulted from a surprising discovery on the extraordinary stability of PLT against dynamic motions of mirrors in our unique active optical cavity, which may enable in space propulsion for an extremely wide range of unprecedented NASA missions. For example, 10,000 times recycling of photons with 15 kilo-watt input laser power, which can be delivered by a 100 kW solar panel would produce up to 1 N of photon thrust, which is sufficient to enable these missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of most crucial technologies to scaling up and implementing the PLT is Directed Energy technology that has developed and matured long range delivery of high power laser beams. The state-of-the-art DE technology is capable of delivering powers of multi-mega-watts over distances of hundreds of km, and matured precision pointing and focusing capability. Recently, an AFRL researcher for DE unintentionally demonstrated ~5 mN (more than 100 times scaling up of our previous NIAC demonstration of 35 &amp;mu;N) photon thrust in PLT with the use of a kW-class Thin Disk Laser, although the laser was not optimized for PLT. Currently, the DE community is developing much higher power lasers, and the adaptation of such lasers for PLT can facilitate Newton-class PLTs in the near future. Therefore, the time has arrived to develop and implement PLT for a wide range of unprecedented in-space NASA applications and this is the motivation for the present NIAC Phase II proposal.&lt;/p&gt;",
