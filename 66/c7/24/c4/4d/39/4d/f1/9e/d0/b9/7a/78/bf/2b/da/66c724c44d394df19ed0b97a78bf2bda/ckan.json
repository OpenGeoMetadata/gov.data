While these maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unit's authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes.\\\" As such this data is intended for use as a tool for GIS analysis.

NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. This data was developed from a base cartographic source dat a set, digitizing NPS segment maps. Where available this data set has been validated against parcel descriptions found in the deeds used to acquire the NPS owned portions of this property. Other areas have been validated using only digital imagery provided by the county.The Boundary polygons LRD creates represent the current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full fee ownership or hold other interest (easement, right of way, etc.) in all parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the unit's legislated boundary, the tracts file created by LRD should be used in conjunction with this boundary file created by LRD.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
