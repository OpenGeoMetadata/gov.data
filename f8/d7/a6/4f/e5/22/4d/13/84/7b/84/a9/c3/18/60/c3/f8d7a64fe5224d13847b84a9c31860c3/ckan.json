  "notes": " The Sensors and Autonomous Systems Experimental Facility evaluates emerging robotics and sensor systems. Researchers assess autonomous navigation in complex and confined 3D and urban environments using a three-story high urban terrain replica; single platform and collaborative platform simultaneous localization and mapping; collaboration of heterogeneous teams of air and ground platforms, robotic perception, and intelligence; the human-robot interface; platform state estimation; mobility from man-portable-sized systems to the micro-scale; and next-generation see-through-the-wall, ground penetrating radar, IED detection, and unattended ground sensor technologies. The facility includes a fully integrated camera and GPS system for ground truthing; a dark room to simulate cave-like environments; a control room and lab environments for system repair, development, and experimental control; various urban features to include sidewalks, stairs, ramps, variable pitch roofs, various ingress and egress features, balconies, telephone poles, and overhead wiring; a three-feet deep sand bed for characterization of buried devices; and a 120-feet long above-ground computer-controlled trolley track system for evaluating optical systems and radars.
