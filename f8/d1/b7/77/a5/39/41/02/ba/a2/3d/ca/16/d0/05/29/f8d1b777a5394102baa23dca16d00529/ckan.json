  "notes": "TIGERweb allows the viewing of TIGER spatial data online and for TIGER\n          data to be streamed to your mapping application. TIGERweb consists of a web mapping service and a REST service.\n          \n          Thew web mapping service is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) service that allows users to visualize our TIGER\n          (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database) data. This service consists of two\n          applications and eight services. The applications allow users to select features and view their attributes, to search\n          for features by name or geocode, and to identify features by selecting them from a map. The TIGERweb applications are a\n          simple way to view our TIGER data without having to download the data. The web Mapping services provide a simple HTTP\n          interface for requesting geo-registered map images from our geospatial database. It allows users to\n          produce maps containing TIGERweb layers with layers from other servers. TIGERWeb consists of\n          the following two applications and eight  services: \n          Applications: TIGERweb,  TIGERweb Decennial\n          Services: Current,  ACS15, ACS14, Census 2010 (for the TIGERweb application), Physical Features (for the TIGERweb application),\n          Census 2010 (for the TIGERweb Decennial application), Census 2000 and Physical Features (for the TIGERweb Decennial application)\n        \n          The REST service is a way for Web clients to communicate with geographic information system (GIS) servers through Representational\n          State Transfer (REST) technology. It allows users to interface with the REST server with structured URLs. The server responds with \n          map images, text-based geographic information, or other resources that satisfy the request. There are two groups of services: TIGERweb\n          and TIGERweb Decennial.  The following REST services are offered for both groups:\n          American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Areas\n          Census Regions and Divisions\n          Census Tracts and Blocks\n          Hydrography \n          Labels\n          Legislative Areas \n          Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas and Related Statistical Areas\n          Military and Other Special Land Use Areas\n          Places and County Subdivisions\n          PUMAs, UGAs and ZCTAs\n          School Districts\n          States and Counties\n          Transportation (Roads and Railroads)\n          Tribal Census Tracts and Block Groups\n          Urban Areas \n        ",
