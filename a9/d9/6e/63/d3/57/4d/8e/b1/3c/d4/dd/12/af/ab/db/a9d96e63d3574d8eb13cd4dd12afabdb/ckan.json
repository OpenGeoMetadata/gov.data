    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Invocon's Wireless Intra-vehicle Communication System (WICS) is being designed as an enabling technology for low-cost launch vehicles. It will reduce the cost of these vehicles in primarily three ways:\r\n\r\n1. Minimizing vehicle weight by decreasing bulky cables and connectors - this increases the useful payload and decreases the propulsion requirements.\r\n2. Minimizing physical interconnects - this simplifies integration, testing, and launch control and thereby decreases the labor involved in these tasks.\r\n3. Enabling testing at the vehicle or module level - this reduces the total amount of testing at the component level resulting in a smaller required test budget.  It also reduces the mass of enclosures required in the vehicle.\r\n\r\nWICS will operate wireless networks as part of the closed-loop Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system and the vehicle's data acquisition system.  The two networks share many characteristics while diverging in a few areas based on their specific constraints.  The TVC network must minimize latency and maximize both throughput and reliability.  The data acquisition network must include paths from many locations througout the vehicle.  In order to maximize the return from Phase I, Invocon will concentrate its effort on developing proof-of-concept hardware and emphasize initial software development for the critical control application.",
