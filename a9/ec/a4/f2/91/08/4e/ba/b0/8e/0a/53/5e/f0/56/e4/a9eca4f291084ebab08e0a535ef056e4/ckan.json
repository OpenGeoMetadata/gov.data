  "notes": "This part of SIM 3261 presents data for the bathymetry and shaded-relief maps (see sheets 1, 2, SIM 3261) of the Offshore of Carpinteria map area, California. The raster data file for the bathymetry map is included in \"Bathymetry_OffshoreCarpinteria.zip.\" The raster data file for the shaded-relief map is included in \"BathymetryHS_OffshoreCarpinteria.zip.\" Both are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreCarpinteria/data_catalog_OffshoreCarpinteria.html. The bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Carpinteria map area, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (CSUMB), by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and by Fugro Pelagos for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Joint Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise. The southeastern nearshore and shelf areas, as well as the western midshelf area, were mapped by CSUMB in the summer of 2007, using a 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. The western nearshore area, as well as the western outer shelf area, were mapped by the USGS in 2005 and 2006, using 117-kHz and 234.5-kHz SEA (AP) Ltd. SWATHplus-M phase-differencing sidescan sonars. The nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography were mapped for USACE by Fugro Pelagos in 2009, using the SHOALS-1000T bathymetric-lidar and Leica ALS60 topographic-lidar systems. All these mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from the 0-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters.",
