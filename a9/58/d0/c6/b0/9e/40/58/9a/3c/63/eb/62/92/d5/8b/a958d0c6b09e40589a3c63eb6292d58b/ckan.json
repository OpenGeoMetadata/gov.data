  "notes": "  Description: Area 1-32 consists of four main facilities along with support facilities and explosive storage bunkers. Pads 1 and 2 are designed to statically fire solid rocket motors at ambient pressures with thrust ratings up to one million pounds. The operating floor of the pad is 30 ft wide and 45 ft long. Pad 3 is designed for hazardous operations involving BATES motors and operations that involve the detonation of explosive materials. This area consists of four reinforced concrete pads (A through D), each of which are 18 ft wide by 20 ft long and approximately 18 inches thick. Pad 5 is designed to statically fire solid rocket motors at ambient pressures with thrust ratings up to 36,000 pounds. This area consists of three reinforced concrete pads (A through C), two of which are 10 ft wide by 20 ft long and one is 20 ft wide by 25 ft long.  Purpose: This facility is used for research scale programs on next generation rocket motor components, nozzle and case materials, propellant formulations, and subsystems. Research includes solid rocket motor testing at ground level and tactical scale high hazard testing including destruction.  Products: Development of solid rocket motor components and propellants Advanced rocket technology development Characterization of propellant combustion, ignition, and component performance Solis rocket plume emission characterization Tests which involve detonations or explosions  ",
