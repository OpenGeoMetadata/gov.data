  "notes": "Angler questionnaire data for 1980 indicates 2,001 anglers expended 12,927 angler days to harvest 18,089 fish from the Indian Lakes - Stillwater Marsh complex. Fish per angler day for Indian Lakes was 1.54, whereas fish per angler day for Stillwater and the Canvasback Gun Club was 1.36. Creel census on Indian Lakes was conducted on 14 days between March and September. The 285 fishermen checked fished a total of 842.69 hours to capture 342 fish. Rainbow trout planted in Likes Lake dominated the catch from March through May and composed 27, 19% of all fish checked in 1981. A comparison of past creel census data indicates that catch rates for warm water fish have declined during the last 15 years. Catfish species made up 51.47% of the total catch in this year's creel census. Yellow perch accounted for 19.3% of the catch and white bass, green sunfish and black bass composed only 2.04% of the total catch. Species planted in 1981 include 6,975 rainbow trout, 128 largemouth black bass, and 11,000 channel catfish. The rainbow trout averaged eight to nine inches and were released in Likes Lake. Black bass originated from Wilson Reservoir and were tagged before release into Likes Lake, Papoose Lake and Big Indian Lake. Fingerling channel catfish were distributed into Likes Lake, Big Indian Lake, Papoose Lake and Lead Lake. Population sampling efforts included beach seining to document recruitment and experimental gill nets to determine species composition throughout the Indian Lakes system. During beach seining, 1,685 young-of-the-year fish were sampled. Recruitment was documented for yellow perch, white bass, white crappie, black bullhead, carp and Sacramento blackfish with rough fish species composing 96.32% of the catch. Gill nets were set in all waters with fishery potential. In total, 1,261 fish were sampled, of which carp, tui chub, and Sacramento blackfish composed 82.31% of the catch. Game fish species encountered in order of abundance include: white crappie, channel catfish, white catfish, white bass, yellow perch, black bullhead, Sacramento perch, largemouth black bass and green sunfish. The low frequency of sampling does not allow complete assessment of fish populations, but does indicate an over abundance of trash fish. Water receipts into Indian Lakes totaled 7,563 acre-feet in 1981 and were not sufficient to maintain water levels in all lakes throughout summer months. Monthly water chemistry analysis on Likes Lake, Papoose Lake, Big Indian Lake, Cottonwood Lake and Lead Lake, identified several parameters which may become limiting to game fish during summer months or during periods of reduced water flow. Oxygen depletions of below 5 ppm were documented in Likes Lake, Papoose Lake, Big Indian Lake and Cottonwood Lake from June through August, Average values for pH in the individual waters for the calendar year ranged from 8.4 to 8.84, with values of 10 recorded for one or two months in Upper Lake, Likes Lake, Papoose Lake and Big Indian Lake. Conductivity exceeded 2,000 umhos/cm in most waters during August.",
