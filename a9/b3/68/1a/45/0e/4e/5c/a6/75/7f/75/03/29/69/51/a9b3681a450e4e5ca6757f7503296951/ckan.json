    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The intent of the proposed effort is to investigate the detailed\ncomposite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) performance characteristics\nafter being subject to irradiation, hypervelocity micro-meteor impact,\nand cryogenic environments. This will result in a safer, more reliable\ndesign for high performance COPVs. This intent will be achieved via\nempirical characterization of composite raw materials subsequent to\nexposure of the aforementioned environments. Phase I of this effort\n(NASA contract #NNM06AA56C) demonstrated a significant reduction in\nstructural performance following exposure to various combinations of the\naforementioned environments. This reduction in structural performance\nwould seriously compromise the structural performance of any composite\nstructure to be utilized in deep space applications. The data proposed\nin this effort would be extremely useful to NASA in what might be used\nin the upcoming CEV and CONSTELLATION missions. The aerospace and the\ncommercial communities have shown significant interest in using filament\nwound COPVs for cryogenic applications. In addition there is serious\nconsideration for using COPVs in deep space exploration which would\nsustain significant radiation exposure and possible impact damage.\nConstituent raw materials and existing COPV designs have not been\ncharacterized for the coupled effects of these applications and as such\nthe safety margins for these applications are undefined. Therefore, the\nreliability of such usage is unknown.",
