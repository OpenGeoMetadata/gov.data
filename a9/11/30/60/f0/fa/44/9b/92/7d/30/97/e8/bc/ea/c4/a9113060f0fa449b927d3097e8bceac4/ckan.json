    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Several different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been applied to Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) data to serve the purpose of developing a comprehensive suite of Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) tools. As the theoretical bases for these methods vary considerably, it is reasonable to conjecture that the resulting anomalies detected by them may differ quite significantly as well. As such, it would be useful to apply a common metric with which to compare the results. However, for such a quantitative analysis to be statistically significant, a sufficient number of examples of both nominally categorized and anomalous data must be available. Due to the lack of sufficient examples of anomalous data, use of any statistics that rely upon a statistically significant sample of anomalous data is infeasible. Therefore, the main focus of this paper will be to compare actual examples of anomalies detected by the algorithms via the sensors in which they appear, as well the times at which they appear. We find that there is enough overlap in detection of the anomalies among all of the different algorithms tested in order for them to corroborate the severity of these anomalies. In certain cases, the severity of these anomalies is supported by their categorization as failures by experts, with realistic physical explanations. For those anomalies that can not be corroborated by at least one other method, this overlap says less about the severity of the anomaly, and more about their technical nuances, which will also be discussed.
