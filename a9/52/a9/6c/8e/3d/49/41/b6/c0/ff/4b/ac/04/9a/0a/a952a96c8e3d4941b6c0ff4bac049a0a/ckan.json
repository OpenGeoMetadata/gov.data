  "notes": "TASK NAME: USGS New York CMGP Sandy Lidar 0.7 Meter NPS LIDAR lidar Data Acquisition and Processing Production Task USGS Contract No. G10PC00057 Task Order No. G14PD00797 Woolpert Order No. 073666 CONTRACTOR: Woolpert, Inc. This data set is comprised of lidar point cloud data, raster DEM, hydrologic 3-d breaklines, raster intensity, survey control, project tile index, and project data extent. This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over several areas in New York State to include the entire counties of Bronx, Kings, New York, Richmond, and Queens. Governors, Hoffman, and Swinburne Islands are part of the New York area of interest (AOI), and will be acquired as part of this task order. The total area of the New York Sandy Lidar AOI is approximately 304 square miles. Woolpert acquired lidar data of New York City as part of a task order for the NGA. The flight plan for the New York City NGA Lidar task order was developed with 11 additional cross flights over the Manhattan Metropolitan area to minimize data shadowing and data voids in the lidar dataset caused by tall buildings. The lidar data for the NGA task order was acquired between August 5, 2013 and August 15, 2013. USGS requested use of this data from the NGA, in order to reduce the duplication of lidar data acquisition effort on the New York CMGP Sandy Lidar task order. The NGA approved the use of this lidar data for the USGS task order.Following the approval by NGA, Woolpert was able to utilize the cross flights acquired as part of the NGA task order to minimize data shadowing and data voids caused by tall buildings in the USGS New York CMGP Sandy Lidar task order AOI. The cross flights used in the New York CMGP Sandy 0.7M NPS Lidar Processing task order from the NGA New York City task order were flown on August 6, 2013. The lidar data acquisition parameters for this mission are detailed in the lidar processing report for this task order. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. The tide window requirements for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly.; One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. NOAA OCM has not received any finalized DEMs for this project and do not expect to, therefore any request for these should be directed to USGS' National Map or a contact at Woolpert directly (as listed below).",
