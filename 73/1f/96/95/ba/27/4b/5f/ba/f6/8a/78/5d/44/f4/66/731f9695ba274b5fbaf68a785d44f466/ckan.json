In addition to incorporated places and census designated places (CDPs),\n               economic places include, minor civil divisions (MCDs) in the twelve strong MCD\n               states, and balances of MCDs or counties. An incorporated place, CDP, MCD, or balance\n               of MCD qualifies as an economic place if it contains 2,500 or more people according\n               to the 2010 Decennial Census, or 2,500 or more jobs according to data from the\n               2006-2010 5-year ACS period estimates, or is a new or significantly revised place\n               since the 2010 Census and has an estimated population of 2,500 or greater.
