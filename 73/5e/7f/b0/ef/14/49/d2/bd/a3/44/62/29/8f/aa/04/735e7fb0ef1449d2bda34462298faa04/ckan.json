    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "During the heating season in Sustainability Base, a critical alarm associated with a hot water pump circulating heating water for the radiative system which exchanges heat via a geothermal heat pump was found. After further investigation it was ascertained that many such alarms were experienced throughout the entire heating season. These alarms are triggered as a result of the excursion of the hot water differential pressure outside of a nominal operating envelope for a fixed duration. There is a control system associated with regulating the hot water pump differential pressure to a fixed operating setpoint, and there are natural variations in the system that allow the pressure to be regulated and maintained within these nominal operating bounds. However, when system changes occur such as valves opening or closing to support the distribution of hot water through PVC piping to areas of the building where heating demand is called for in response to zone temperature requirements, the pump's operating speed must change accordingly to maintain this setpoint. If the pump speed does not change quickly enough to accommodate heating demand, these alarms can result and consequentially water hammer can occur, which may lead to accelerated aging of the PVC piping infrastructure as well as fittings, elbows, etc. In the worst case scenario it could cause leaking or bursting pipes.\r\n\r\nThe zip file linked contains three subdirectories and a parameter list to be used for processing using ACCEPT. Datafiles are partitioned into training, validation, and testing sub-directory structures. A text file contains all parameter identifiers associated with the cold complaint prediction scenario. Please note that the parameter list is a text file containing the following lines:\r\n\r\nDCHWSSF - South Wing water flow rate\r\nDCHWSNF - North Wing water flow rate\r\nDCHWDP - Hot Water Pump Differential Pressure\r\nDCHWP1SP - Hot Water Pump Differential Speed\r\nDCHWP1S - Hot Water Pump Status Indicator\r\n\r\nThe last parameter in this list is intended only to provide indication of ground truth (pump exceedances), and is not meant to construct models in ACCEPT. Data was collected from November 03, 2014 to February 03, 2015, and the alarm threshold limits of operation are flagged above 6.0 psid and below 4.5 psid. It should be noted the normal operation for the pump includes periods when it is off, when it retains a residual static pressure (~ 1.0 psid). The static binary indicator provides this information.",
