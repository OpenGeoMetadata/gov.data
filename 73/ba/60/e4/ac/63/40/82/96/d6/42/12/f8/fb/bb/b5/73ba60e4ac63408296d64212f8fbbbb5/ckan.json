    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop novel FPGA-based algorithmic technology that will\nenable unprecedented computational power for the solution of large\nsparse linear equation systems. In Phase I, we will develop a prototype\nof a non-von-Neumann linear equation solver equipped with our\ntechnology, and demonstrate an intermediate milestone for its\noperational speedup and performance gains using at least two of the CFD\nproblems in the NAS benchmark. Phase I will also deliver a clear\ntechnology roadmap in terms of algorithmic and architectural innovations\nneeded to bring the project to success by the end of Phase II. Four\nmission-critical areas to the success of an FPGA-based non-von-Neuman\nsystem within a von-Neumann-based supercomputing environment are\nidentified, namely (1) portability; (2) ease of use; (3) algorithmic\nspeed balance between von-Neumann and non-von-Neumann components; and\n(4) communication speed. Innovative architectural and algorithmic\nmethods aimed at boosting system effectiveness through each one of the\nfour areas are proposed. In particular, we propose the use of\n&amp;quot;portability wrappers&amp;quot; to enable wide portability at both\nhardware and software levels, software drivers in the form of an API for\nease of use from a C and/or Fortran environment, innovative\nreconfigurable computing algorithms and bit structure optimizations\nsuited to the LU factorization problem for speed, and a novel\nalgorithmic technique within the reconfigurable computing paradigm that\neffectively eliminates the communication bottleneck, typical of\nmulti-system distributed algorithms, for the LU factorization problem.\nThe performance attainable with a single FPGA will be comparable to that\nof a 1,000-node commodity cluster, while exhibiting reductions of one to\ntwo orders of magnitude in both cost and power consumption.",
