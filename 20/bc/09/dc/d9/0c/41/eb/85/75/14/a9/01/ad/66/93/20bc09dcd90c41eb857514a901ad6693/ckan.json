  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides an oil-free, high-vacuum chamber for vacuum ultraviolet calibration and testing of extreme and far ultraviolet sensors. The system is used to determine an instrument&amp;#39;s optical characteristics by simulating the naturally occurring diffuse airglow emissions of the Earth&amp;#39;s upper atmosphere. It is also capable of performing component-level testing and characterization of an instrument&amp;#39;s individual optical components before instrument assembly. DESCRIPTION: The Vacuum Ultraviolet Calibration/Testing Facility is a series of clean vacuum chambers capable of generating and detecting UV radiation required for optical calibration of space experiments. It was built to support the optical development, testing, and calibration of the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Limb Imager (SSULI). It has also been used to test and calibrate the six flight Tiny Ionospheric Photometer (TIP) instruments, the High-resolution Ionospheric and Thermospheric Spectrograph (HITS), the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS), the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI), and others. Using an advanced graphical interface, the facility can be easily reconfigured for a wide variety of UV measurements. A silicon carbide reflection diffuser provides diffuse radiation in the far and extreme UV portions of the spectrum. Calibrated reference detectors monitor the radiation levels during an experiment. Inside the chamber, precision translation and rotation stages allow motion of the test component along four independent axes. To minimize contamination, the end of the vacuum chamber is inside a Class 1000 clean room. The entire facility can be used interactively, and work is in progress to automate the facility to allow remote monitoring via a network connection. The facility consists of three vacuum vessels specifically designed for the fabrication and testing of sensors and components operating in the 80 to 170 nm spectrum. The primary vacuum vessel is a 1.67-m-diameter by 2-m-long stainless steel tank. This chamber is evacuated using oil-free cryogenic, turbo, and roughing pumps with a typical operating pressure of 1 x 10   -6   Torr. UV radiation s delivered into this system using two gas discharge lamps, which can be configured for directed beam applications or as a diffuse source or for both simultaneously. Inside the chamber are several motion stages for remote positioning of the instrument or components being tested. Positively charged ions can be injected into the chamber with energies up to 3 keV to test an instrument&amp;#39;s susceptibility to a charged environment. A rare gas analyzer monitors outgassed contaminants from the items under test. Another vacuum vessel in the facility includes a chamber for independently testing and assembling far UV sealed tube detectors. The facility includes a vacuum chamber dedicated to the deposition of thin-film photocathodes and a 0.6-m-diameter chamber for thermal vacuum testing components or small instruments that require stimulation of UV radiation.
