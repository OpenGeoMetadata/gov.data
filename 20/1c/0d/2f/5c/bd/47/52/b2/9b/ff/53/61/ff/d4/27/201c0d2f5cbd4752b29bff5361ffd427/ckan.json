  "notes": " FUNCTION: Mercury is NRL&amp;#39;s newest pulsed-power generator facility. It is a state-of-the-art, 6-MV, 375-kA, 50-ns, 2.2-TW magnetically insulated inductive voltage adder (IVA). Mercury is a focal point of research for several areas, including IVA power-flow research and development, X-ray source development for both high-resolution flash radiography (in support of the U.S. Stockpile Stewardship Program) and nuclear weapons effects simulation, and particle-beam source and transport research for various applications. DESCRIPTION: Mercury is a 6-stage IVA. The oil-immersed Marx bank comprises thirty-six 2.2-&amp;#956;F, 100-kV capacitors (396 kJ at 100-kV charge). The erected Marx discharges into four parallel coaxial water capacitors, also immersed in oil, that make up the 36-nH intermediate store (IS). Each IS discharges into three 5.5-  &amp;#937;   coaxial water pulse-forming lines (PFLs) through  a laser-triggered gas switch. Each of the twelve 50-nslong (two-way transit time) PFLs is switched out through self-closing water output switches into a coaxial water output line that connects the PFL to an induction cell through a coaxial oil-filled elbow. Two PFLs feed each of the six induction cells, one from the top and one from the bottom. The voltage on each induction cell is added up in vacuum along a magnetically insulated transmission line to obtain the final voltage. Thick concrete walls surround the generator to contain X rays. INSTRUMENTATION: A full array of electrical diagnostics is monitored on a bank of transient recorders in an electrically shielded room located outside the radiation-shielded area. Complementing the electrical diagnostics is a full set of time-resolved and time-integrated radiation diagnostics, as well as state-of-the art interferometric diagnostics. The generator operation is computer controlled.  ",
