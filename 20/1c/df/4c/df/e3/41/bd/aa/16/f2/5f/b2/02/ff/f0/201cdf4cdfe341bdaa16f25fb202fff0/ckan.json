    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advatech Pacific proposes to develop a Virtual Satellite Integration Environment (VSIE) for the NASA Ames Mission Design Center.  The VSIE introduces into NASA Mission Design Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools and processes, which haven proven themselves in the industrial manufacturing world.  In addition to COTS PLM tools, the VSIE hinges on two key concepts: An enhanced Digital Mock-Up (termed DMU++) and the so-called Common Geometry Strategy.\r\n \r\nDMU typically addresses mechanical form, fit and function of a component or sub-assembly in the assembly context. We propose to go one step further and address electrical power, data, and other similar interfaces in the DMU to automatically detect compatibility issues beyond mere mechanical fit. This will be an enabling functionality for rapid mission design and integration of components from a database of existing off-the-shelf hardware such as the database currently under development at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. \r\n\r\nThe Common Geometry Strategy was introduced in the late 1990s in both the commercial aircraft engine and automotive industries, however, it has so far not found its way into satellite design or satellite mission design. The fundamental idea is that the same Master Model geometric information is readily available to all disciplines and individuals that need geometric information to perform their job. Since a particular disciplinary specialist may require only an abstraction of the detailed 3D-geometry, the idea of a \"Context Model\" is introduced. The Context Model is a simplified representation of the detailed 3D CAD model, which is simplified precisely to the level of detail required by the specialist, while maintaining full associativity to the Master Model geometry, so that it either automatically updates when the Master Model geometry changes, or at least notifies the specialist that it is out of date.\r\n",
