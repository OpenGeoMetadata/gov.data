  "notes": "Bathymetry: coral collected live in ~3m of water in September of 1992. Coral species: Porites lutea. Variable names: The Excel File contains 4 worksheets labelled Raw Data, 92-52 mo., 1951-1657 qtr., and Published 1992-1657 Qtr. The last worksheet contains age, delta18O and delta 13C used in Quinn et al. (1998). These data have been interpolated at 4 samples/year using AnalySeries (Paillard et al., 1996). Path refers to sampling pathway; values range from 1 to 30. Sample id refers to numbering scheme used in sampling. Cells with more than 1 value reflect offset and overlapping sequences. Stable isotope data for these cells are averages of overlapped samples. Sample # refers to sequential numbering of all data from top to bottom. Overlapped samples counted as one sample. Raw delta 18O, delta 13C isotopic values as they were determined on the mass spectrometer. Year: calendar year assignments based on integrated use of density-bands and observed SST measurements. Post-AS delta 18O, delta 13C refers to data that have been interpolated at equal age increments using the software program AnalySeries (Paillard et al., 1996). Conversion from depth to age was accomplished using the age model feature of AnalySeries. Variable unit: per mil relative to VPDB. Data precision: Precision (&oacute;2) was monitored by daily analyses of a powdered calcite standard (NBS-20) and was better than 0.08 per mil for both oxygen and carbon. The average standard deviation of forty-six replicate analyses of coral samples is 0.10 per mil for oxygen and 0.07 per mil carbon. Data format: Values are reported in standard notation relative to VPDB after correction for the 17O contribution. Sampling information: We sampled the coral at two levels of sampling density. The upper 40 years of the coral was sampled at 12 samples/density-band couplet (dbc). The remainder of the coral was sampled at 4 samples/dbc.",
