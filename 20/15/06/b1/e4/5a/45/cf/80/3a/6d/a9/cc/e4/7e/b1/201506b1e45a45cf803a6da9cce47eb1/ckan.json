    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project (TransCom) was created to quantify and diagnose the uncertainty in inversion calculations of the global carbon budget that results from errors in simulated atmospheric transport, the choice of measured atmospheric carbon dioxide data used, and the inversion methodology employed. Under the third phase of TransCom (TransCom 3), surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes were estimated from an intercomparison of 16 different atmospheric tracer transport models and model variants in order to assess the contribution of uncertainties in transport to the uncertainties in flux estimates for annual mean, seasonal cycle, and interannual inversions (referred to as Level 1, 2, and 3 experiments, respectively).This data set provides the model output and inversion results for the TransCom 3, Level I annual mean inversion experiments. Annual mean CO2 concentration data (GLOBALVIEW-CO2, 2000) were used to estimate CO2 sources. The annual average fluxes were estimated for the 1992-1996 period using each of the 16 transport models and a common inversion set-up (Gurney et al., 2002). Methodological choices for this control inversion were selected on the basis of knowledge gained from a wide range of sensitivity tests (Law et al., 2003). Gurney et al. (2003) present results from the control inversion for individual models as well as results from a number of sensitivity tests related to the specification of prior flux information. Additional information about the experimental protocol and results is provided in the companion files and the TransCom project web site (http://www.purdue.edu/transcom/index.php).The results of the Level 1 experiments presented here are grouped into two broad categories: forward simulation fields and response functions (model output) and estimated fluxes (inversion results).",
