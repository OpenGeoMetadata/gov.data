  "notes": "State Assessment of Forest Resources: Issues and Sub-Issues Statewide Forest Resource Strategy Idaho Department of Lands Developed by the Idaho Department of Lands in partnership with many other agencies and organizations, the Statewide Assessment of Forest Resources (SAFR) is a key element in the redesign of the USDA Forest Service's State and Private Forestry, and is a requirement within the 2008 Farm Bill for states receiving funding through the US Forest Service for State and Private Forestry programs. Its purpose is to ensure that federal and state resources are focused on landscape areas with the greatest opportunity to address shared priorities and achieve measurable outcomes. SAFR provides a geospatial analysis of conditions and trends for all forested lands in Idaho. It delineates rural and urban forest areas that are the highest priority for projects and investments administered through State and Private Forestry programs. Threats to and benefits from forest resources were identified and form the foundation of the analysis. A schematic of these issues, sub-issues and how they roll up to the final assessment map can be accessed by clicking on the link below. The companion Statewide Forest Resource Strategy (SFRS) identifies activities and approaches for management, protection, restoration and enhancement of forest resources to address the issues within the priority landscapes identified in the assessment.",
