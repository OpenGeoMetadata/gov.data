  "notes": "  Program Capabilities   Food Analysis  SAN-DO Laboratory has an expert in elemental analysis who frequently performs field inspections of materials. A recently acquired portable X-ray fluorescence device performs field examination of products for a wide range of elements. The facility contains a HEPA filtered room used for samples undergoing elemental analysis The laboratory has a highly qualified group of seafood sensory analysts, including a national expert in the sensory analysis of East Asian ethnic foods. The seafood chemistry group also has implemented rapid screening of samples for histamine by a quick screen called Flow Injection Analysis (FIA), in addition to the more time consuming official analyses for chemical indicators of decomposition. General Chemistry staff is experienced in established FDA methodology for colors analysis and food additives. Staff expertise in HPLC, MS and other contemporary separation technology contributes to developments in analysis of food additives.  Microbiology  The Microbiology Section has full service capability and analyzes a wide range of foods, drugs and cosmetics for pathogens and sterility, using both conventional and molecular techniques. A sterility room is maintained for sterility testing and a class 2 microbiology room is operated as part of the Laboratory Response Network.  Specialized Capabilities  The laboratory maintains an Organoleptic Training Room designed to train analysts in detection of decomposition odors, and a HEPA-filtered room dedicated to elemental analysis. In addition, the facility has a clean room for sterility testing of pharmaceuticals and devices. SAN-DO lab currently is the only laboratory performing regulatory analyses for enteric viruses. SAN-DO Laboratory currently is the only lab testing for Hep.A in produce.  ",
