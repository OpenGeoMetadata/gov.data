    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The next generation of space systems can benefit greatly by reduced c-SWaP integrated gyroscopes. By using photonic integration, it is possible to fit the entire gyro onto a single chip and inside a package &lt;10 cm3, weighing &lt; 50 g, and consuming &lt;1 W of power. Furthermore, the fabrication of such chip-scale solutions reduces the cost per unit dramatically as ~thousands of optical gyroscopes can be made on each wafer and assembled using mature high-throughput semiconductor technology.  \r\n\r\nFreedom Photonics has developed advanced photonic integrated circuit (PIC) and planar lightwave circuit (PLC) capabilities to realize this device.  By leveraging our technology, we can delivery &lt;0.05 deg/hr sensitivity optical gyroscopes with 10x lower weight, volume, and cost. These gyroscopes will have few components, require minimal assemble, and have no moving parts. The highly integrated devices are more resilient to shock and vibration, and can have longer gyroscope lifetimes with fewer component failures.       \r\n\r\nIn Phase I of this program, Freedom Photonics will determine the feasibility of meeting space-grade gyroscope specifications with a low c-SWaP solution leveraging our proprietary, commercially deployed photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. A hardware benchtop demonstration will be included.",
