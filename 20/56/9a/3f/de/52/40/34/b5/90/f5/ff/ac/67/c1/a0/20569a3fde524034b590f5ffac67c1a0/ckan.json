  "notes": "The dwarf wedgemussel (Alasmidonta heterodon) has been listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species since 1990. This species, once found in at least 70 locations along the Atlantic coast, now inhabits only 20 locations in eight drainages, four of which are in Maryland. The FWS recovery plan states that the two eastern shore streams -- Long Marsh Ditch and Norwich Creek -- may be impacted by agricultural practices, populations are sparse and may not be reproducing. One of the two western shore locations, McIntosh Run, appears to support an apparently reproducing population of hundreds of dwarf wedgemussels. The other western shore location, Nanjemoy Creek, may be intermediate in health between the eastern shore locations and McIntosh Run. The objectives of this study were to generate and compile chemical, physical, ecological, and toxicological data on the four Maryland mussel sites to identify possible stressors. Sediment and water column chemistry did not indicate the presence of organic or inorganic contamination; nor did sediment toxicity tests with Hyalella azteca indicate acute toxicity. Acetylcholinesterase assays with the common mussel, Elliptio complanata (used as a surrogate), revealed significant differences in activity between the streams but no evidence of pesticide-induced inhibition. Dwarf wedgemussels require an intermediate fish host for larval development and metamorphosis. Tesselated darters (Etheostoma olrnsted), a known host fish, were obtained during electroshocking surveys at all four streams. The data base is inadequate to determine whether sufficient numbers of host fish are present at critical times to support mussel reproduction. Physical habitat characteristics at Long Marsh Ditch were particularly poor, indicating the effects of channelization. Further investigations should quantify sediment loading, identify stressful levels of nutrients and suspended sediments, and repeat the cholinesterase assays during a period of heavy agricultural runoff. Research on the identification of fish hosts is underway. Regular quantitative (yet non-destructive) monitoring of mussel and fish host populations is needed to guide remediation efforts. Recommended management actions are to increase the extent of forested buffers on the two eastern shore streams, prevent dumping at Nanjemoy Creek, and strictly control erosion in the McIntosh Run watershed.",
