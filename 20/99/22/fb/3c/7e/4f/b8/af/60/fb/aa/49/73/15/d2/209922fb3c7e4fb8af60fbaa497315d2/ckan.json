    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Fiber reinforced composite materials are used extensively in aerospace applications due to their high stiffness and strength to weight ratio, and superior thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic and fatigue properties. However, given their demanding operational environment, composite aerospace and aircraft structures are prone to damage and manufacturing related flaws. An accurate assessment of composite structural performance and system life management strategies requires quantitative information on the aforementioned damage states of the components. Recent advances in infra-red (IR) sensing and data processing technologies have enabled real-time thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) methodologies to finally become viable for accurate diagnostics and prognostics of composite structures. The success of these thermography methods, however, depends strongly on the characteristics of the surface of the composite components. Materials Technologies Corporation (MTC) proposes to develop a specialized, spray-on and peel-off coating technique which would facilitate high accuracy quantitative thermoelastic analysis through improved IR response and thus enable on-going in-situ diagnostics and prognostics during component lifecycle without necessitating disassembly and off-line inspection. A major benefit of the product would be to facilitate usage of less expensive inspection systems that can take advantage of the advanced high emissivity coatings.",
