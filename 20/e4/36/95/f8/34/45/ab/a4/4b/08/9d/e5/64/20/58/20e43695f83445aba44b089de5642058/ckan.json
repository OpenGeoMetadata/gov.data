  "notes": "A study incorporating several investigative methods was conducted at the Deep Fork River, Okmulgee, Oklahoma in and near the Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge. The mussel communities in the river upstream and downstream of two point-source discharges, the CP Kelco (Kelco) discharge and the City of Okmulgee Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) discharge, were assessed. Mantle glycogen, community structure, caged adult mussel survival, and caged juvenile mussel growth and survival were the methods used, along with water quality assessment. Glycogen data were not conclusive, with no significant differences between any sampling sites above and below the two discharges. Mussel community structure data indicated reductions in mussel numbers, density, and diversity at both downstream sites compared to the respective upstream sites, especially at the Kelco discharge. Caged mussel data, both for adults and juvenile mussels, indicated high mortality rates downstream of the Kelco discharge but not below the WWTP discharge. Water quality data indicated high chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus values in the Kelco discharge and downstream of the discharge compared to upstream values, and water temperature was considerably higher at the mouth of the discharge and immediately downstream, compared to water temperature upstream and outside of the dischargeâ€™s path. Inspections of the mussel community downstream of the WWTP indicated that the community had not yet fully recovered from the WWTP sewage release in 2000, but current conditions were conducive to mussel growth and survival. Overall, the data indicated that the Kelco discharge poses a significant concern for the well-being of the resources sensitive to water quality in the Deep Fork River, while during the study the WWTP appeared to pose no significant threat to the mussel community downstream of the discharge. However, considering its history including previous violations of its CWA permit, the WWTP should be monitored as well as the Kelco discharge.",
