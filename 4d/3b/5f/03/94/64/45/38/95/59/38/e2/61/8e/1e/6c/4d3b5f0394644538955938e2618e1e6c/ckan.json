    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this proposal, TiER1 Performance Solutions and Alion Science and Technology offer to identify requirements and specifications, and implement a proof-of-concept prototype tool to support human factors evaluations.  This prototype, called the Human Factors Evaluation Automated Tool (HFE-AT), will provide guidance, for non-human factors personnel, to address human factors-related aspects of the engineering design process.  It will identify requirements for coordination across engineering teams to help ensure that potential human factors integration issues are identified and resolved early in the design process.  HFE-AT also will indicate when more detailed human factors analyses are needed, and provide step-by-step guidance to walk users through the process of performing certain human factors analyses.  It will provide a repository for the results and allow users to produce reports that help them interpret and summarize the results.  In Phase I, we propose to identify the requirements for such a tool, create a plan for developing the tool, and develop a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the potential for such a tool.  In Phase II, we will continue the development of this tool, adding functionality and expanding the scope.  We also will perform validation studies, to ensure that the tool is providing meaningful results.  We will conduct usability studies, and modify the tool so that it provides an easy-to-use interface, understandable feedback, and useful results.  In Phase III, we will prepare this tool for commercialization. ",
