    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Thorleaf Research, Inc. proposes to develop a miniaturized, low power gas chromatograph (GC) with sample pre-processing capability and enhanced capability for handling high inertial loads in a modular design optimized for integration into flight instrumentation. Our innovative approach employs a miniature sampling valve and loop to provide selective pre-concentration of trace level compounds from the sample stream using adsorbents and/or cryogenic focusing. This leak-tight design minimizes the number of components and tubing connections, thereby reducing instrument volume and mass while enhancing system robustness and improving inertness. We believe it will be possible to develop the miniaturized GC system at a mass of about 1 kg, average power consumption of less than 0.5 watts for isothermal operation, and sample pre-concentration factors of up to 1000x, with capability to withstand a kilo-g. This modular design can be interfaced to miniature mass spectrometers (MS), ion mobility spectrometers (IMS), and other detectors of interest to NASA.  The goal of our proposed SBIR Phase 1 effort is to demonstrate feasibility for a miniaturized, low power GC with sample pre-processing capability and enhanced g-force survivability for planetary missions, and to develop a detailed design for fabricating and demonstrating prototype instrumentation in Phase 2.",
