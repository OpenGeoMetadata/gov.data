    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The OMI/Aura Level-3e SO2 Data Product OMSO2e (Version 003) is now available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) for public access (http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omso2e_v003.shtml)\n       \nThe Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was launched aboard the EOS-Aura satellite on July 15, 2004 (1:38 pm equator crossing time, ascending mode). OMI, with its 2600 km viewing swath width, provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) in collaboration with the Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal investigator is Dr. Pieternel Levelt of the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). OMI is designed to monitor stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic eruptions, and key tropospheric pollutants (HCHO, NO2) and ozone depleting gases (OClO and BrO). OMI sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products are archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC.\n  \n(The shortname for this Level-3 OMI total column SO2 product is OMSO2e) \nThe  lead algorithm scientist for this product is NASA/GSFC OMI scientist Dr. Nikolay Krotkov (nickolay.a.krotkov@nasa.gov).\n\nIn this Level-3 daily global SO2 data product, each grid contains only one observation of Total Column Density of SO2 in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL,) based on an improved Band Residual Difference Algorithm (BRD). This single observation is the \"best pixel\", selected from all \"good\" L2 pixels of OMSO2 that overlap this grid and have UTC time betweeen UTC times of 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.9999. In addition to the SO2 Vertical column value some ancillary parameters e.g cloud fraction, terrain height, scene number, solar and satellite viewing angles, row anomaly flags, and quality flags have been also made available corresponding to the best selected SO2 data pixel in each grid.       \n   \nOMSO2e files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). The maximum file size for the OMTO3e data product is about 7 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found from the site http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml \n\nA short OMSO2e Readme Document that includes a brief algorithm description and documents that provide known data quality related issues are available from the OMI GES DISC site( http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omso2e_v003.shtml )",
