    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Cloud computing has the potential to permit scientists to scale up to solve large science problems without having to invest in hardware and software infrastructure. Even though its use has become commonplace in the business realm, its use in HPC is still limited to a few applications. This project aims at developing, prototyping, validating, and commercializing the world's first cloud-enabled acceleration library of linear algebra solvers. Considering that linear algebra is the most common computational bottleneck in scientific software applications (more than 70&#37; of HPC cycles), the resulting Specialized Linear Algebra Cloud technology will directly impact numerous applications, such as the design of aerospace and automotive vehicles, exploration for new oil &amp; gas reserves, nuclear energy research, and the design of computer chips, among many others.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I work will incorporate innovations for removing the bandwidth bottleneck in the outsource model of a Specialized Linear Algebra Cloud. We will also design a core platform able to support solver-as-a-service technology in HPC environments. The Phase I technology will be evaluated in three different scenarios: (A) Infrastructure Cloud outsourcing computations to Specialized Clouds, (B) Infrastructure Cloud making use of internal Specialized Clouds, and (C) End-users accelerating code through direct access to Specialized Clouds.\r\n\r\nAccelogic's novel numerical libraries are expected to provide next-generation speed/efficiency to existing cloud systems, with direct application to NASA programs, other government applications, and many valuable uses in academia and the private sector.  The Phase I proof-of-concept work should advance the technology from TRL 2 to TRL 3, and we expect to reach TRL 5 during Phase II. A world-class combination of experts in algorithm design, computer networks, and numerical analysis pursue these development goals.  \r\n",
