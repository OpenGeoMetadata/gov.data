    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project is to extend current ground-based Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) techniques to a long-duration, space-based tool to more effectively predict the risk associated with human actions on long-duration missions.&amp;nbsp; By doing so, the agency will be able to focus resources on the risk drivers, such as specific training, conditioning, procedures, exercising, etc. for these future missions.&amp;nbsp; NASA uses Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs) to assess the probability of Loss of Crew (LOC) and Loss of Mission (LOM).&amp;nbsp; PRAs take into account multiple contributing factors and their interactions, such as how the crew, software, and hardware work together to achieve mission objectives.&amp;nbsp; HRA is used to assess the human contribution to risk in PRAs.&amp;nbsp; Current HRA techniques were developed for ground applications using Earth based human reliability data to estimate human error probability.&amp;nbsp; These ground-based HRA techniques have been shown to be a reasonable tool for short-duration space missions, such as Space Shuttle and lunar fly-bys.&amp;nbsp; However, longer-duration beyond Earth orbit missions, such as asteroid and Mars missions, will require crews to be in space for 400 to 900 days with periods of extended autonomy and self-sufficiency.&amp;nbsp; Current indications show higher risk due to fatigue, physiological effects due to extended low gravity environments, and others, which may impact HRA predictions by affecting the crew&amp;rsquo;s cognitive abilities, as well as their physiology, and yield a higher probability for LOC and LOM (e.g. early return).&amp;nbsp; PRAs will need to account for these effects in order to provide management, designers, and the crew our best estimate of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the funding of this IR&amp;amp;D project over the next three years, Safety &amp;amp; Mission Assurance (S&amp;amp;MA) will collaborate with Human Health &amp;amp; Performance (HH&amp;amp;P) to establish what is currently used to assess human reliability for human space programs, identify human performance factors that may be sensitive to long duration space flight, collect available historical data, and update current tools to account for performance shaping factors believed to be important to such missions.&amp;nbsp; JSC&amp;rsquo;s Human System Integration (HSI) initiative is a work in progress to better understand how the crew, software, and hardware work together and ensure that HSI is accounted for in future space mission designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
