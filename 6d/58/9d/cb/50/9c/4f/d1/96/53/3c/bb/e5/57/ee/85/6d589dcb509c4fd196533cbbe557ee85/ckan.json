    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There has been a tremendous increase in the volume of sensor data collected over the last decade\r\nfor different monitoring tasks. For example, petabytes of earth science data are collected from modern\r\nsatellites, in-situ sensors and different climate models. Similarly, huge amount of flight operational data\r\nis downloaded for different commercial airlines. These different types of datasets need to be analyzed\r\nfor finding outliers. Information extraction from such rich data sources using advanced data mining\r\nmethodologies is a challenging task not only due to the massive volume of data, but also because these\r\ndatasets are physically stored at different geographical locations with only a subset of features available\r\nat any location. Moving these petabytes of data to a single location may waste a lot of bandwidth.\r\nTo solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel algorithm which can identify outliers in the\r\nentire data without moving all the data to a single location. The method we propose only centralizes\r\na very small sample from the different data subsets at different locations. We analytically prove and\r\nexperimentally verify that the algorithm offers high accuracy compared to complete centralization with\r\nonly a fraction of the communication cost. We show that our algorithm is highly relevant to both earth\r\nsciences and aeronautics by describing applications in these domains. The performance of the algorithm\r\nis demonstrated on two large publicly available datasets: (1) the NASA MODIS satellite images and (2) a\r\nsimulated aviation dataset generated by the ‘Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation’ (CMAPSS).\r\n",
