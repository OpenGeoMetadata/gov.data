    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optical Physics Company (OPC) proposes to adapt the precision star tracker it is currently developing under several DoD contracts for deep space lasercom beam pointing applications.  The advantages of using an interferometric star tracker for beam pointing are numerous, these include the following: \r\n\r\n1.\tCelestial reference based beam pointing eliminates need for having a ground based beacon for return beam pointing.  \r\n\r\n2.\tPrecision star tracker can be part of the spacecraft attitude control subsystem, thus allowing a single high performance instrument to support both attitude control and lasercom beam pointing functions.  \r\n\r\n3.\tBy allowing the lasercom system to point with a faint beacon and/or weak stars, the same lasercom system architecture can be employed for both deep space flight terminal and the near-Earth terminals operational from near orbit to very deep space mission.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will be a firm foundation for Phase II:  We will not only have developed the concept and the design of the Precision Pointing Platform but also validated the functionality and performance using detailed simulation that includes models of the active isolators and the jitter environment with high fidelity.  The simulation will use a realistic star background.  Furthermore, Phase I work will also produce a pointing error budget that takes into consideration effects of SNR, unrejected platform jitter, alignment errors and optical fabrication errors.",
