    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The proposed technology development concept is a software application tool developed for use on a mobile device at SSC for use in the component retrieval system (SOCS). The development of a mobile application that provides field access to the component database is a type of technology that has been proven successful in the private sector. The project purpose was to demonstrate feasibility that using a mobile application could provide benefits, cost savings, and could be used across Stennis.&amp;nbsp; With this type of tool, personnel could easily access information within SSC&amp;rsquo;s component retrieval systems instantly, providing the real-time information that is often required for the timeliest decision-making. Additionally, an electronic audit trail would enable the ability to see who performed tasks and help reduce error. The result could be a substantial increase in productivity. The capability could provide a new level of accountability for a wide variety of component monitoring retrieval processes. For this project, initial requirements to develop a mobile application software tool that could be used to retrieve detailed information on components from the SOCS database were compiled.&lt;/p&gt;",
