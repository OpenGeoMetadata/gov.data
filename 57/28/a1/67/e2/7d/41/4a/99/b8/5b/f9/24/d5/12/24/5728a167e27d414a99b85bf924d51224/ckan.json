    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The program focuses on turbulence modeling enhancements for predicting high-speed rocket base flows. A key component of the effort is the collection of high-fidelity data for supporting turbulence model validation and calibration. Base flow configurations of interest to NASA Marshal will also be investigated using improved modeling tools. Experiments for supersonic rocket base flows will be performed in the new 12?X12? tunnel, at the National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA), utilizing high-quality base flow models, provided by the US Army. Measurements will include Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for turbulent statistics, supplemented by Schlieren, Raman spectroscopy and Rayleigh scattering. Complimentary Large Eddy Simulations (LES) will provide additional turbulence statistics that are not readily/reliably measured. The data will support enhancements to the CRAFT Tech unified k-epsilon turbulence model. The impact of employing a variable turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt number methodology, based on a two-equation scalar variance framework, will be considered for reacting and non-reacting base flows. The effort will lead to extended validation of enhanced turbulence modeling tools, increased reliability of base drag &amp; heat flux predictions and fills a major gap at NASA by improving upon base region simulation capabilities required for launcher design aerothermal predictions.",
