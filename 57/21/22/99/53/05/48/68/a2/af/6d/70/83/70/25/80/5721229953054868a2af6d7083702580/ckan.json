  "notes": "This report summarizes a study with the following results: 1. The key species chosen for this study were the osprey, tricolored, great and little blue herons, and the snowy, great and cattle egrets. 2. The wading bird colonies at Upper Bird Key and Lower Bird Island (in Matlacha Pass) and the colony at Matanzas Pass proved to contain the species variety and, for the most part, numbers of nests that were desirable for this comparative study. 3. The late authorization of the Federal Collection Permit limited the number of osprey (and perhaps great blue heron) eggs that could be collected. 4. Broader geographic coverage of colonies throughout the Charlotte Harbor region would have been desirable, but the nesting of key species toward the center of most colonies in the northern part of the harbor made those nests unobservable. 5. Based on an inventory of active colonies in the Charlotte Harbor area, most survey data have been collected by the GFC and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Data are clustered around the periods 1976-1978 and 1986-1989. 6. Eggshell thicknesses for collected eggs are as follows, based on actual measurement (mm) and Ratcliffe's Index: tricolored heron - 0.228, 1.13 (n = 11); great blue heron - 0.489, 2.25 (n = 1); little blue heron - 0.216, 1.11 (n = 11); snowy egret - 0.206, 1.02 (n = 9); great egret - 0.279, 1.49 (n = 7); cattle egret - 0.216, 1.03 (n = 3); and osprey - 0.490, 2.44 (n = 2). Data for herons and egrets are broken down by colony in Table 7. 7. Early morning feeding flights during the nestling period were documented for the three colonies. An examination of those flights and an aerial inventory revealed that the subject wading birds (including the cattle egret) are likely to be feeding heavily in the flooded saltern habitat behind the mangroves and, to a lesser extent, the shallow open waters in front of the mangroves. Cattle egrets flew, of course, toward more upland habitats, but specific locations were not pursued. 8. A total of 40 eggs and 8 prey items were analyzed for Abate. Abate was not found in any sample above the detection limit of 0.05 u9/9 dry weight of sample.",
