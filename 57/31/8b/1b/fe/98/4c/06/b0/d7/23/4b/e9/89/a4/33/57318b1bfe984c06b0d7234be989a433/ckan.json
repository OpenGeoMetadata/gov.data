    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There are two major commercial types of light-scattering particle size\nanalyzers: Static Light Scattering and Dynamic Light Scattering. They\nare expensive, delicate, bulky, and must operate at extremely low\nparticle concentrations. A fundamental mathematical model for high\nconcentrations has been in need for decades and finally developed by the\nauthor after 25 years of research and development (METAMODEL&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n).   UV-NIR spectroscopy has a long successful history for molecular\ncharacterization of gases, liquids, or solids but commercial particle\nsize analyzers based on this powerful principle do not exit. Seven\nimpediments for its presence in the market are identified and their\nresolution either described as already accomplished by the author or\nachievable with a high probability of success during Phase I.  It is our\nlong-term goal to develop a commercial UV-NIR high dynamic-range,\nminiaturized, robust spectrometer for particle size analysis in the\nrange 1 nm to 10 um (METASIZER&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n). During Phase I, a breadboard prototype to demonstrate feasibility\nwill be developed. We firmly believe that, due to its expected superior\nperformance and lower cost, our innovation and its derivatives could\nrevolutionize the field of particle sizing in both diluted and\nconcentrated particulates. Applications are innumerable ranging from\nmaterials science through pharmaceuticals to environmental.",
