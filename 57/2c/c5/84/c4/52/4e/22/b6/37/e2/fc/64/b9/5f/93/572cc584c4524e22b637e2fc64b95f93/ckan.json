    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &amp;nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome. The JSC-directed solicitations program enables the Center to invest strategically in high priority areas needed to accomplish future missions as articulated in the NASA Technology Roadmaps and the Space Technology Investment Plan (STIP). It offers the Center the ability to address technology gaps that are beyond the requirements of near-term programs to fund.&amp;nbsp; It also provides a platform to continue to grow and maintain critical skills and innovations needed to ensure future mission success.&amp;nbsp; These solicitations encourage use of collaborations to ensure maximum benefit to both the space program and the nation.&amp;nbsp; As such, external partnerships are highly encouraged not only as a funding leverage but to bring innovative ideas and approaches into human exploration programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, JSC solicitations are developed by the JSC CTO and the JSC Technology Working Group (JTWG). The competitive calls are coordinated with JSC Senior Staff and communicated to the JSC workforce via internal email distribution to an R&amp;amp;D community list and through postings on the internal center website and through JSC Today notices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The JTWG solicits, evaluates and prioritizes all JSC solicitation responses in a two-stage process. The JTWG members review project proposals and work together to down-select to the finalists. The Principal Investigators (PIs) make presentations to the JTWG to provide more in-depth project details. This allows the members to select the finalists to support for the year.&amp;nbsp; Selection criteria and funding vary based on the focus of the solicitation but of primary interest are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human Space Flight Architecture Team (HAT) prioritized technology needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Priority JSC technology core competencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High potential areas for technology commercialization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High potential areas for technology partnerships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Accomplishments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the result of research and development, JSC&amp;rsquo;s IR&amp;amp;D project PIs are making important progress in the advancement of technology needed to enable NASA&amp;rsquo;s mission of space exploration. In addition, many of the technologies development to meet the challenges of space exploration have great commercialization potential. Each year, many of JSC&amp;rsquo;s IR&amp;amp;D projects file New Technology Reports (NTRs) through the JSC Tech Transfer Office. Several of these reports have received New Technology Evaluation Patent ratings to pursue patents, while additional ones have been scheduled for success story articles to be written and published.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSC projects active in FY12 and beyond have been included in TechPort. Through the TechPort tool information on the projects is provided and will be updated by PIs as developments and updates become available. This will offer further knowledge and information sharing between NASA developers, researchers, engineers and scientists and other internal and external stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;",
