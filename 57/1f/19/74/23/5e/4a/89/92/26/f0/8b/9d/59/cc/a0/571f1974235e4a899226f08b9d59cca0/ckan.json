  "notes": "The decline of pelagic organisms in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) has been attributed to several factors including water diversions, invasive species and exposure to environmental contaminants. This study was conducted to assess the effects of waterborne contaminants on resident fish species in the San Francisco Estuary using juvenile striped bass as a surrogate for endangered endemic species. The study was performed as collaboration between researchers from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey, California Department of Fish & Game and UC Davis researchers. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service deployed semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) at five sites in Delta locations within the San Francisco Estuary year-round. SPMDs mimic the bioaccumulation of lipophilic contaminants in fish over a 30 day period. Once retrieved the SPMDs contents are extracted and chemical analyses performed. Half of the SPMD extract was prepared in a manner suitable for injection into control juvenile striped bass to assess potential physiological effects caused by any lipophilic contaminants from the sites. To assess these effects five biochemical biomarker assays; liver cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), vitellogenin (VTG), metallothionein (MT), 7-ethoxyresorufin -O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and molecular assays were performed. Results indicate several sites were positive for P-4501A1 induction indicating sublethal contaminant exposure, vitellogenin expression was found at several sites indicating exposure to estrogenic compounds or their mimics as well as metallothionein expression indicating severe oxidative stress. Induction of biomarker activity in fish by injection of extracts of SPMDs has provided a method for monitoring waterborne anthropogenic contaminant mixtures in the environment. Results from these studies will help characterize spatial and temporal patterns of xenobiotics in the Deltaâ€™s water, identify potential adverse effects on resident endangered fish species. Further studies are needed to monitor contaminant exposures using biomarkers and to integrate them into a more effective pelagic species recovery plan in the San Francisco Estuary.",
