  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides a Maritime Navigation Radar (MNR) Range consisting of 28 MNRs located 8.75 nautical miles east of the NRL Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) on Tilghman Island, MD. These radars are the same as those used on all merchant vessels and represent a precise cross-section of today&amp;#39;s actual MNR environment. The Range provides the emitters and analysis tools to aid the research of new technologies required to understand and exploit this class of emitters essential in developing comprehensive Maritime Domain Awareness. DESCRIPTION: The range includes radars in both S and X bands, radars of nearly every power level and of every antenna size, each fully characterized in terms of detailed signal characteristics, effective radiated power level, antenna size, scan rate, and PRI pattern, and all completely documented and precisely located by means of a differential GPS survey. Available radars include a large selection from both the Furuno and Raytheon families, and somewhat smaller selections from the JRC, Koden, SI-TEX, Anritsu, and BridgeMaster families. Having the ability to quickly, easily, and economically isolate and study any given MNR signal or performance capability, or readily construct and analyze an existing or potential operational scenario, or validate reception or processing capabilities against these low power signals, in an active, real-time environment with accurate ground truth, makes the range a valuable and up-to-date asset for assisting with development of both local and national Maritime Domain Awareness capabilities. INSTRUMENTATION: Selected radars are remotely controllable, some are instrumented with temperature sensors, and all are radiated for extended periods. Monitoring instrumentation at the CBD in Chesapeake Beach, MD, includes precision track-whilescan radar, advanced electronic intelligence analysis system, precision ESM direction finder, precision optical system, sensor fusing and cueing software, specific emitter identification capability, and comprehensive data collection, processing, analysis, and distribution suites, all modular and tailorable to meet user needs.
