  "notes": "Rarotonga coral radiocarbon (14C) timeseries. Coral radiocarbon (Delta-14C) on untreated, low-speed drilled samples. Precision is +/- 4 per mil as documented by an in-house homogenized coral standard, and presented as AGE CORRECTED DELTA-14C [see Stuiver Polach, 1977]. The sample cores were made on a Porites lutea coral located in open marine conditions off Rarotonga. Cores were split and cleaned with distilled water. After identifying the major vertical growth axis, the coral was sequentially sampled at 1 mm increments with a low-speed drill. Splits (~1 mg) were reacted in vacuo in a modified autocarbonate device at 90 deg C and the purified CO2 analyzed on a gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Additional splits were analyzed by ICP-AES for Sr, and Ca. The delta-18O and [Sr/Ca] results were individually mapped to the Kaplan OI and IGOSS sea surface temperature time-series for the grid box containing Rarotonga. The resulting age model indicates an average linear extension rate on the order of 16mm/yr with an estimated age-model error of +/-1 month. For the interval 1959-1997, approximately every other sample was analyzed for 14C (~8samples/yr), and for the interval 1950-1959 every sample was analyzed. Splits (~10mg) were placed in individual reaction chambers, evacuated, heated, and then acidified with orthophosphoric acid at 90 deg C. The evolved CO2 was purified, trapped, and converted to graphite in the presence of cobalt catalyst in individual reactors [Vogel et al., 1987]. Graphite targets were measured at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [Davis et al., 1990]. Radiocarbon results are reported as Delta-14C (\") as defined by Stuiver and Polach [1977] and include the d13C correction obtained from the stable isotope results and are \"age corrected\". Analytical precision and accuracy of the radiocarbon measurements is +/- 4\" (1s) based on repeated analyses of an in-house homogenized near-modern coral and accepted secondary and tertiary radiocarbon standards. In keeping with the definition of \"high-precision radiocarbon\" (less than 3 per mil, 1-sigma) data have been rounded to zero significant figures.",
