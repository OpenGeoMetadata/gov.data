    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project addresses the need for a framework and domain architecture suitable for reconfigurable transceivers and associated component technologies. The goal of this effort is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost.  WW Technology Group's (WWTG) approach provides a formalized structure for: (1) the design and implementation of reconfigurable computing (RC) using FPGAs for high performance parallel processing and (2) algorithm updates over the life cycle of the platform.  In addition, this RC-Enabled approach can replace manual, ad-hoc development methods and support Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) activities that allow the dynamic modification of the functional configuration of the RC hardware and adaptive computing.   Specifically, WWTG's approach offers reconfigurable software and firmware that provides access control, and reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration.\r\n\r\nThe WW Technology Group (WWTG) presents a novel approach for reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems that provide high performance within the constraints of power consumption, reliability, size, and weight.  By combining the system on a chip (SoC) technologies in a distributed platform supported by a flexible software infrastructure, our system strikes the optimal balance between size, power consumption, and functionality.\r\n",
