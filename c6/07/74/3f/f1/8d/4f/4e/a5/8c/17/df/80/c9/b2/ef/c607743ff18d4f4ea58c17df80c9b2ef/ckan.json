    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The liberation of particles induced by rocket plume flow from spacecraft landing on unprepared regolith of the Moon, Mars, and other destinations poses high mission risks for robotic and human exploration activities. This process occurs in a combination of \"extreme environments\" that combine low gravity, little or no atmosphere, rocket exhaust gas flow that is supersonic and partially rarefied, and unusual geological and mechanical properties of highly irregular surface regolith. CFDRC and the University of Florida will deliver unique plume driven erosion simulation software for such environments by combining novel granular physics simulation modules developed by UF with multi-phase gas-granular flow simulation software developed by CFDRC. Granular flow constitutive models, formulated through first-principle 3-D Discrete Element Method particle kinetics and implemented in an efficient Eulerian gas-granular flow solver are the foundation of this software. The fidelity of these simulations will be advanced towards simulating particle compositions with broad shape and size variations. Novel particle kinetics modeling concepts will be applied to formulate granular flow physics models for both, realistic irregular particle shapes and dispersed particle size distributions. Phase I demonstrated the successful implementation and validation of irregular granular shape physics modeling in CFDRC's gas-granular multi-phase flow solver. An approach for extension to poly-disperse particle mixture simulations was also developed. Full integration of these models in Phase II will enable the simulation of gas flow interaction with poly-disperse, irregular shaped particle materials. Extensive verification, validation, and application demonstrations will be performed. The proposed technology development will result in unprecedented computer modeling capability for predicting liberation and flow of realistic granular material compositions in extreme extra-terrestrial environments.",
