The NECTAs that combine to create a  CNECTA retain separate identities within the larger combined statistical area.  Because CNECTAs represent groupings of NECTAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual NECTAs.  \r\n\r\nThe CNECTA boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.\r\n            ",
