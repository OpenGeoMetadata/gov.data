    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Due to the extensive amounts of data generated from the genome sequencing projects, the focus of genomics has shifted from elucidating DNA sequence to the interpretation of gene function.  In addition, as proteins are most often the targets of drugs, a method of studying the genome at the protein level is fueling the pharmaceutical industry?s interest in proteomics.  By interpreting the interacting partners of a protein of interest and stimuli that affect these conditions, much can be learned about the protein?s function.  To help fuel the proteomics revolution, Agave BioSystems, in collaboration with Dr. Robert Boyd, of the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester, proposes to develop an ultra sensitive analytical tool based on whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator technology for the detection of protein-protein interactions.  Simulations have demonstrated that WGM resonator technology can provide several orders of magnitude greater sensitivity as compared to current detection mechanisms such as SPR.  The microfabrication of this detection mechanism, coupled with microfluidic systems to be developed in the Phase II, will result in a disposable biochip that can be readily used in a small, compact and portable instrument.",
