    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Adaptive control offers an opportunity to fulfill present and future\naircraft safety objectives though automated  vehicle recovery while\nmaintaining performance and stability requirements in the presence of\nunknown or  varying operating environment. Future aircraft are a natural\napplication of adaptive control. These aircraft will be more fuel\nefficient, have longer operating ranges though  more flexible aircraft\nstructures.  This increased flexibility will result in structural modes\nbeing in the same frequency range as the rigid body modes.  The\ntraditional non-adaptive control design approach to address the\naeroservoelastic (ASE) interaction of decoupling the rigid body and\nstructural dynamics  will not work. Furthermore, the application of\nadaptive control to these flexible aircraft may result in undesired ASE\nexcitation leading to structural damage or failure.   Hence an\nintegrated flight control system is needed for gust load alleviation,\nflutter suppression and rigid body control of the aircraft which works\nin concert with the adaptive control system for improved resilience and\nsafety. MUSYN proposes an integrated approach based on linear,\nparameter-varying  (LPV) control to the design of the flight control,\nload alleviation and flutter suppression algorithms. The Phase I and\nPhase II research will focus on applying and extending LPV techniques to\nmodel, design, analyze and  simulate control algorithms for flexible\naircraft. The objective is to combine the integrated LPV flight control\nsystem with adaptive control to preserve rigid body performance during\nupsets while retaining the load  alleviation and flutter suppression\ncharacteristics of the  nominally augmented aircraft.  Phase I will\ndevelop a prototype LPV framework for modeling, analysis, control and\nsimulation and Phase II will develop a comprehensive LPV software tool suite.",
