    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project will further MBSE technology in fundamental ways by strengthening the link between SysML tools and framework engineering execution environments. Phoenix Integration has produced a commercial tool (MBSE Pak) which allows engineers to link SysML diagrams (in MagicDraw and Rhapsody) to ModelCenter, a general-purpose engineering integration framework. As a result, from SysML parametric diagrams, engineers can execute actual engineering analysis tools for the purpose of systems architectural design, requirements compliance, trade studies, etc. This proposal would extend this MBSE product in several specific ways. First, it would develop a systems analysis capability for improved management decisions including the ability to perform what-if studies of technology options, simulation of schedule and cost, and probabilistic discrete event simulation for risk analysis. Second, it would improve verification and validation of models through improved requirements compliance analysis, handling of time series data, and traceability of data pedigree for modeling artifacts. Third, it would connect SysML models to executable model libraries in which components can be executed in an ad-hoc manner (on any capable computer) from the library itself and include rich support for multi-fidelity modeling tools on  the backend. A representative system model would be developed as an example problem to illustrate the developed features and would be demonstrated to NASA throughout the course of the work.",
