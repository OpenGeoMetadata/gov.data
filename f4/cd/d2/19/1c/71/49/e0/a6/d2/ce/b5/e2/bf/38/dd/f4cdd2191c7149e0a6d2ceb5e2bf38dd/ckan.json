    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Despite the rapid commercialization of additive manufacturing technology such as selective laser melting, SLM, there are gaps in process modeling and material property prediction that contribute to slow and costly process qualification and product certification. To address these gaps, CFDRC and our partner Dr. Kevin Chou, University of Alabama, will develop multiple computationally efficient, high-fidelity simulation tools for the SLM process.  During Phase I the team will apply adaptive meshing to enable efficient thermomechanical simulations for centimeter size test coupon builds, leverage existing multiphase flow models to analyze particle size effects on material variations, apply phase field models to predict microstructure evolution, and evaluate model predictions against experimental characterization.  During Phase II, the modeling tools will be extended to improve computational efficiency and scalability to aerospace component dimensions by further leveraging parallel computing and other acceleration techniques.  The fidelity of the models will be enhanced to better predict distortion, residual stress, microstructure and defects from process conditions; and additional process data will be used to validate the resulting codes.  The resulting toolset will be capable of efficiently predicting these dimensional and microstructural properties of SLM components from process conditions, while addressing important design and build features such as overhanging sections and build supports.  The high-fidelity, physics based nature of the codes will allow straightforward application to new materials, and to guiding development of and verifying analytical physics models for process control.",
