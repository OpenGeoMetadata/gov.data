    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": " Abstract: The Landsat Orthorectified data collection consists of a global\n                set of high-quality, relatively cloud-free orthorectified MSS, TM and ETM+ imagery\n                from Landsats 1-5 and 7. This dataset was selected and generated through NASA's\n                Commercial Remote Sensing Program, as part of a cooperative effort between NASA and\n                the commercial remote sensing community to provide users with access to\n                quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over the\n                Earth's land masses. The data collection was compiled via NASA contract with Earth\n                Satellite Corporation (Rockville, MD) in association with NASA's Scientific Data\n                Purchase program. The Landsat Orthorectified data collection consists of\n                approximately 7,500 MSS (Landsat 1-5) images, 7,461 TM (Landsat 4-5) images and\n                approximately 8,500 ETM+ (Landsat 7) images, which were selected to provide two full\n                sets of global coverage over an approximate 10-year interval (circa 1990 and circa\n                2000). All selected images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover.\n                In addition, only images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possible\n                presence of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected. Purpose:\n                To provide users with access to quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images\n                with global coverage over the Earth's land masses. Supplemental_Information: The\n                average acquisition date for the Landsat Orthorectified ETM+ data is 2000 (+/- 1\n                year). All scenes were acquired between 1999 and 2001. These data have been\n                orthorectified for coregistration with the earlier (circa 1990) Landsat TM coverage.",
