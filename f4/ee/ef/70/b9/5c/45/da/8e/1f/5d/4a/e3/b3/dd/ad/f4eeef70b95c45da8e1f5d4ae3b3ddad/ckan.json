    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The \"HIRDLS/Aura Level 2 Geophysical Parameters\" data product (HIRDLS2) contains an entire day's worth of Level-2 vertical profiles of O3, HNO3, H2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, N2O, NO2, N2O5, ClONO2, temperature, geopotential height, and aerosol extinction at 12.1 and 8.3 microns, as well as cloud top pressure. The HIRDLS2 data are provided on 24 levels per decade of pressure corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The vertical range of the data depends on the measured species. The current and final version of this product is 7. Of the original targeted species, only CH4 was not retrieved in this version.\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a single swath object with one day of data (measured species and species precision), geolocation fields (e.g. time, latitude, longitude, pressure), and swath attributes, along with file level metadata. Each file contains approximately 5600 profile scans. Time stamps are in TAI-93 format (seconds since January 1, 1993) as well as in seconds since start of day. Arrays with missing data are set to a constant fill value (-999.0). \n\nThe High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) aboard the EOS Aura spacecraft was launched July 15, 2004. The instrument was designed to scan the Earth limb at multiple azimuth angles, measuring infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging from 6.12 to 17.76 microns in the upper troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. On July 30, 2004 when the instrument was switched on, it was discovered that a piece of plastic film was blocking most of the HIRDLS scanning mirror. Only a small portion of the mirror at the far azimuth scan (away from the sun side) was clear for making observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Several attempts to remove the blockage were unsuccessful. This obstruction resulted in limited data coverage between -64 and +82 degrees latitude, and thus excluded observations over the Antarctic region. The first reliable data are from January 29, 2005, earlier data from January 21 to 28 are of substandard quality and are not included in version 7. From January 3 to March 17, 2008 the chopper frequency became erratic, and data for these days should be used with caution. The HIRDLS instrument remained operational until March 17, 2008 when the chopper stalled.\n\nParameters contained in the data files include the following:\nVariable Name|Description|Units\nO3|Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nHNO3|Nitric Acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nCFC11|CFC-11 (CFCl<sub>3</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nCFC12|CFC-12 (CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nClONO2|Chlorine Nitrate (ClONO<sub>2</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nN2O|Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nN2O5|Dinitrogen Pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nNO2|Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nH2O|Water Vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nTemperature|Temperature Profile|K\nCloudTopPressure|Pressure of Top of Clouds|hPa\n8.3MicronExtinction|Aerosol Extinction at 8.3 Microns|1/km\n12.1MicronExtinction|Aerosol Extinction at 12.1 Microns|1/km\nGPH|Smoothed Geopotential Height|m\nRawGPH|Raw Geopotential Height|m\nEnd of parameter information",
