The compilation of this data is a collaborative effort between the Arkansas Geographic Information Office and the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) to build a comprehensive geographic database of Local Health Units as a component of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). The Local Health Units form a sub-component of the existing CDC Bioterrorism plan that involves the visualization application for disease detection and surveillance. A visual aid of health unit locations overlaid on current digital aerial photography, associated road names, and landmarks, were produced to representatives of ADH to confirm the accuracy of the location.",
