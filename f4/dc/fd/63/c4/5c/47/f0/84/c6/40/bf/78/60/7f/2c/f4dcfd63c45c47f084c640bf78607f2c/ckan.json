    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains forest canopy scan data from the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI) and field measurements data from three campaigns conducted in the United States: 2007 New England Campaign; 2008 Sierra National Forest Campaign; and 2009 New England Campaign. The New England field sites were located in Harvard Forest (Massachusetts), Howland Research Forest (Maine), and the Bartlett Experimental Forest (New Hampshire).The objective of the research was to evaluate the ability of the EVI ground-based, scanning near-infrared lidar to retrieve stem diameter, stem count density, stand height, leaf area index, foliage profile, foliage area volume density, and other useful forest structural parameters rapidly and accurately.The EVI scan data are Andrieu Transpose (AT) Projection images in ENVI *.img and *.hdr file pairs. There are 28 images from the 2007 New England Campaign, 30 images from the 2008 Sierra National Forest Campaign, and 54 images from the 2009 New England Campaign. There are range-weighted mean preview image files (.jpg format) for each AT Projection image.Manual measurements of tree structural properties were made during each campaign at EVI scan locations. The field measurements are provided in one file for each campaign (.csv format). Parameters include species identification, DBH, tree height, crown base, etc. organized by field plot. There is also a data file (.csv format) which compares EVI derived measurements to the field measured data (DBH, stem density, basal area, biomass, and LAI) from the 2007 New England Campaign.",
