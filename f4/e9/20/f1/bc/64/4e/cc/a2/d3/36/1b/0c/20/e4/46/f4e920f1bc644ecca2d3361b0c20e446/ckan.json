  "notes": "This image represents a LiDAR (Light Detection & Ranging) bathymetric mosaic (mean 4 meter gridded) collected along the coastline of southwestern Puerto Rico. The Tenix LADS Corporation (TLI) acquired bathymetric LIDAR for NOAA from 4/07/2006 to 5/15/2006. Data was acquired with a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mk II Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and 175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 4x4 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. In total, 265 square nautical miles of LiDAR were collected between -50 m (topographic) and up to 70 m (depth), requiring a total of 102 flight hours (134 hours, including flight time to and from San Juan airport). Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, and water clarity influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was processed using the LADS Mk II Ground System and data visualization, quality control and final products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS 6.1 and CARIS BASE Editor 2.1 The project was conducted to meet the IHO (International Hydrograph Organization)Order 1 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
