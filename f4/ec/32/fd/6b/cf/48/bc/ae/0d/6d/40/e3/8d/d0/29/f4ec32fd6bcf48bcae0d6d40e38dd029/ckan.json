    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposal enables development a miniature, low power consumption,\nfused deep UV Raman and native fluorescence (DUV-RF) stand-off sensor.\nThe proposed fused instrument has the ability to measure the spatial\ndistribution of chemical species containing C, N, H, O, S, Cl, and/or\nwater, ice, and hydrated minerals on a 1-5 mm spatial scale enabled by a\nnovel set of wide aperture, high sensitivity ultraminiature deep UV\nRaman spectrometers.  Raman spectroscopy is a non-contact,\nnon-destructive, method of identifying unknown materials without the\nneed for sample acquisition and processing. This technique is ideal for\nin situ exploration from extraterrestrial Rovers or landers. There are\nthree main advantages of deep UV Raman methods over near-UV, visible or\nnear-IR counterparts.  1) Rayleigh-law: signal enhancement of 20x at\n248nm compared to excitation at 532nm. 2) Resonance: much higher signal\nenhancements; for water 5 times greater than Rayleigh-law enhancement\nalone, for a combined effect over 120x between 248 nm and 532 nm.  3)\nWith excitation below 250nm, Raman scattering bands occur in a\nfluorescence-free region of the spectrum.  At longer excitation\nwavelengths fluorescence from target or surrounding materials overwhelm\nRaman emissions and require gating with high power lasers with narrow\npulse widths leading to sample alteration/damage. When deep UV Raman is\ncombined with native fluorescence, it becomes possible to characterize\nmineral alterations and detect trapped chemicals with exquisite\nsensitivity and differentiability.  The New Frontiers has placed a South\npole-Aitken Basin sample return as a future mission scenario. Using the\nenhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF, water, ice and chemical\nspecies can be detected and mapped to provide an understanding of their\ndistribution in the lunar regolith.",
