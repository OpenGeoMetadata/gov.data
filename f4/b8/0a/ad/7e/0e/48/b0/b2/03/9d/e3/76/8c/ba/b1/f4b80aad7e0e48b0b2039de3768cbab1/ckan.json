  "notes": "In 1993, a study was initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arlington, Texas, Field Office to determine organic and metal contaminant levels within three lentic systems in the Cypress Creek watershed in Northeast Texas. Cypress Springs Reservoir, Lake O' The Pines, and Caddo Lake were the three lentic bodies selected for this study. From 1993 through 1994, surface water sediment and biological samples were collected from each of these systems. Surface water samples were analyzed for dissolved aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, strontium, vanadium, zinc, and total mercury content. Sediment samples were analyzed for total aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, strontium, vanadium, and zinc content, as well as aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine residues. Biological samples collected consisted of fish, macroinvertebrates, and nestling great blue herons (Ardea herodias). The fish samples collected consisted of whole body composites and fillets which were analyzed for organochlorine residues and the same total metal contaminants as mentioned above. The macroinvertebrate samples consisted of whole body composite grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.) which were also analyzed for total metals. Kidney and feather samples collected from the great blue herons were analyzed for total mercury content, while liver samples were analyzed for total metal content. Data resulting from this study were evaluated to determine potential health risks to fish and wildlife resources. The results indicated that Cypress Springs Reservoir was the least contaminated of the three systems. Cadmium levels were detected in surface water samples in excess of the State of Texas water quality criteria in all three water bodies. Sediments collected at Lake O' The Pines contained concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc that exceeded the State of Texas chronic aquatic life protection criteria, while sediments collected from Caddo Lake contained Pb and Hg levels which also exceeded the State chronic aquatic life criteria. Aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds were detected in sediments from all three systems in low concentrations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in sediments collected from Cypress Springs Reservoir and Caddo Lake in low concentrations in comparison to aquatic life criteria developed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, whereas sediment samples collected from Lake O' The Pines contained some elevated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Organochlorine residue concentrations were below the analytical detection limits in sediments collected from all three bodies. Whole body composite fish samples collected from all three water bodies contained elevated Hg levels in excess of predatory protection limits recommended by USFWS; however, fillet samples contained mercury concentrations below the United States Food and Drug Administration action level for human consumption. Fish collected from Caddo Lake also contained chromium and selenium levels elevated above the predatory protection limits recommended by the USFWS, but below current fish consumption advisory levels in the U.S. Macroinvertebrates and great blue herons collected from Caddo Lake exhibited elevated levels of Hg. In addition, the great blue herons sampled at Caddo Lake contained elevated levels of Zn. Fish collected from all three systems contained low concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in comparison to the criterion developed by the National Academy of Sciences/ National Academy of Engineering. One fish collected from Lake Oâ€™ The Pines contained a concentration of total- PCB in excess of the predatory protection level recommended by the Great Lakes International Joint Commission.",
