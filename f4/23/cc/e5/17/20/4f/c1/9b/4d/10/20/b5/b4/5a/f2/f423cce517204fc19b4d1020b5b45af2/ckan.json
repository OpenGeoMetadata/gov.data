  "notes": "In 1992, approximately 2,106 pairs of the endangered California Least Tern (Sterna antillarum browni) nested at 38 sites along the coast of California, from the San Francisco Bay area in the north, south to the Mexican border. This 15% increase over 1991 breeding population size continues the trend since 1987 of continued growth of the population, and is directly attributable to the efforts of people working on behalf of recovery of the species. The statewide  total of 2,106 pairs is the highest number recorded-since systematic monitoring began in 1973, and represents a greater than three-fold increase over the estimated 600 pairs of that year. The increase in the number of nesting sites over 1991 (34) and 1990 (30) reflects both the expansion of terns into new areas adjacent to already established sites, and the return of terns to areas used historically but not in the recent past. The increase hi the number of breeders was somewhat eclipsed by the much reduced statewide production of fledglings. The total of 1,362-1,448 fledglings produced in 1992 is lower than the numbers produced by 1,830 pairs in 1991 (1,729-1,839) and 1,706 pairs in 1990 (1,487-1,676). Low fledgling production per pair in 1992 (.6S-.69) was attributed to both predation and the deleterious effects of El Nino on food availability. Breeding failure and success was strikingly localized, and sites hit hardest by both predation and a shortage of food were located in the southern portion of the State (in San Diego County). Eight sites had relatively high fledgling production per pair (S>1); fledglings produced at four of those eight sites (NAS Alameda, Venice Beach, Seal Beach, Santa Margarita River North Beach) comprised 65% of the total produced statewide. Because an annual fledgling to pair ratio of less than 0.7 results in a decline in the size of the breeding population two years later, and past El Nino events have been shown to affect the population dynamics of terns over a protracted period, the combined effects of predation and low food availability on Least Tern reproductive success in 1992 are likely to hinder population growth for several years to come.",
