    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Lightning Nitrogen Oxides Model (LNOM) combines detailed, flash-specific measurements of lightning with both theoretical and empirical laboratory results to obtain estimates of lightning NOx production.  Each LNOM dataset is based on measurements from a specific regional VHF Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and on ground flash location, peak current, and stroke multiplicity data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN).  Both the LMA and NLDN data are used to determine the flash type (ground or cloud) of each flash occurring within an analysis cylinder.  The LNOM analyzes the LMA sources to estimate the total channel length of each flash. It also produces the Segment Altitude Distribution (SAD) product by dicing up the lightning channel into 10-m segments, and then tallies those segments as a function of altitude.  From all of the 10-m segments, the LNOM computes the vertical lightning NOx profile inside the analysis cylinder and the total NOx produced by each flash.  A summation of the NOx profiles contributed to the analysis cylinder by each flash gives the final lightning NOx profile product for the analysis period studied (typically a 1 month profile).  The LNOM NOx profiles include NOx from several non-return stroke lightning NOx production mechanisms.  Users of LNOM data typically include regional air quality and global chemistry/climate modelers who need to better-parameterize lightning NOx sources.  Rather than assigning an unrealistic fixed amount of NOx to ground and cloud flashes, the modeler can employ LNOM data to assign realistic (and statistical) NOx profiles to each flash.",
