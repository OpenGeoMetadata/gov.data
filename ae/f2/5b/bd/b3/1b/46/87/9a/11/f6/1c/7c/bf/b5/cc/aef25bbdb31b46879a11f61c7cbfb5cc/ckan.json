    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current Multilayer Insulation (MLI) technology is over 50 years old, and\nis typically comprised of 10 to 120 layers of metalized polymer films\nseparated by polyester netting. MLI is the best thermal insulation in a\nvacuum, and is the insulation of choice for spacecraft and cryogenic\nsystem insulation, but has problems relating to density control and\nperformance, application labor, and difficulty covering small and large\nscales. An innovative concept for improved cryogenic insulation,\nIntegrated MLI, is proposed based on a micro-machined or micro-molded\nsubstructure. Thermal conductivity will be lower than conventional MLI,\nlayers would be inherently attached to each other and support one\nanother, construction would be easier, and the vacuum shell could be\nsupported by the IMLI, greatly reducing the mass of the insulation\nsystem with vacuum shells used to insulate cryogenic dewars or tanks.\nAn improved insulation should provide lower thermal conductivity, lower\nspecific thermal conductivity, vacuum compatibility, layers inherently\nattached to each other that support themselves, efficient assembly and\nprovide structural reliability. Recent advances in injection molding has\nresulted in the ability to mold structures with very small features,\ncomprised of materials with low thermal conductivity and low outgassing.\nIntegrated MLI will consist of small micro-machined or micro-molded\nstructures that support radiation barrier layers, and will offer\nsignificant advantages. Preliminary analysis of several potential\ndesigns indicates IMLI has a theoretical thermal conductivity less than\nhalf that of MLI, allowing improved long term cryogenic propellant\nstorage and spacecraft thermal performance. It may provide improved\nstructural assembly, strength and integrity over current MLI. This\nproposal is to work on the design, material selection, assembly\nprocesses and preliminary physical property testing of a prototype of\nthis innovative new thermal insulation.",
