    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Phase I SBIR project seeks to develop a 500 Wh/kg Lithium primary battery for intended application as the primary power source on landers and probes for future missions to Titan/Enceladus and near Earth asteroids. The proposed battery technology aims to offer a viable alternative to Li/SO2 primary batteries which were used in the most recent mission to Titan. A thorough analysis of power requirements for the Huygens-Cassini mission (2005 landing) will be undertaken from the point of view of identifying engineering areas where the benefits of introduction of a more potent battery could be realized. Developers will focus on the engineering and performance testing of two distinctly different cell designs in a 32650 cylindrical cell housing. An integral part of the new battery will be a system of smart electrical heaters which, at a fraction of available battery power, will turn resistive heaters on and off as required to compensate for heat losses through the battery box wall (the assumption of the model being studied is that the battery should not require the use of external radioactive heating sources to maintain operation). This project will see the introduction of several new materials which will be manufactured by the contractor for purposes of boosting the energy efficiency of the proposed battery system.",
