    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The reprocessed Aura OMI Version 003 Level 2 Cloud Data Product OMCLDRR is made available (in April 2012) to the public from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldrr_v003.shtml ) Aura OMI provides two Level-2 Cloud products (OMCLDRR and OMCLDO2) at pixel resolution (13 x 24 km at nadir) that are based on two different algorithms, the Rotational Raman Scattering method and the O2-O2 absorption method. This level-2 global cloud product (OMCLDRR) provides effective cloud pressure and effective cloud fraction that is based on the least square fitting of the Ring spectrum (filling-in of Fraunhofer lines in the range 392 to 398 nm due to rotational Raman scattering). This product also contains many ancillary and derived parameters, terrain and geolocation information, solar and satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI Cloud Pressure and Fraction product is OMCLDRR and the algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joinner. OMCLDRR files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMCLDRR data product is about 9 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml . A short OMCLDRR Readme Document that includes brief algorithm description and data quality is also provided by the OMCLDRR Algorithm lead. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was launched aboard the EOS-Aura satellite on July 15, 2004(1:38 pm equator crossing time, ascending mode). OMI with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. OMI is designed to monitor stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic eruptions, and key tropospheric pollutants (HCHO, NO2) and ozone depleting gases (OClO and BrO). OMI sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products are archived at the NASA GES DISC. For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments/omi/ http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/ . Data Category Parameters: The OMCLDRR data file contains one swath which consists of two groups: Data fields: Two Effective Cloud Fraction and two Cloud Top Pressures that are based on two different clear and cloudy scene reflectivity criteria, Chlorophyll Amount, Effective Reflectivity (394.1 micron), UV Aerosol Index (based on 360 and 388 nm), and many Auxiliary Algorithm Parameter and Quality Flags. Geolocation Fields: Latitude, Longitude, Time, Solar Zenith Angle, Viewing Zenith Angle, Relative Azimuth Angle, Terrain Height, and Ground Pixel Quality Flags. OMI Atmospheric data and documents are available from the following sites: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/ http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/",
