    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to take information from multiple operational environments and securely deliver it in a graphically useful manner to the end user. This flow of information must be tightly controlled and protected to prevent unintentional leaks of sensitive data prior to receipt by the user. Once the data reaches the user, it must be presented in a useful manner. A simple example of this sort of information would be log messages. A user cannot simply be sent all log messages; the originating system must have the ability to configure which messages will be made available and the end user must be able to filter critical alarm alert messages from mundane logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique challenge of this project is not only its technical feasibility, but also the need to meet GSFC&amp;rsquo;s network security requirements. The capability to move small amounts of data for a single mission with limited security has been demonstrated; however the problem of moving larger amounts of data quickly while keeping the process compliant with GSFC network security practices has not been solved. Work on this IRAD will be performed in collaboration with Goddard Communications and Security Services Division to ensure that all software is in compliance with these GSFC network security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the data arrives at its destination it must be strategically presented to maximize its usefulness. There are, of course, many possible applications that can be conceived to meet mission operations needs, such as health and status displays of operational components. The scope of this work will include selecting and implementing a presentation of the data that will be of most benefit to end-users. Based on current knowledge of mission needs, this application will focus on presenting the status of mission operations hardware and software for one or multiple missions. This will allow both the monitoring of single missions and the consolidate aggregation of status information for the monitoring of large portions of the GSFC Satellite Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key deliverables for the first phase of this proposal are the software transport framework to move data from the operations center to the user, &amp;nbsp;the corresponding web-based application to display the targeted data, and instructions on how to enable and configure the integrated application to ensure compliance with GSFC network security requirements. The compliant framework and web application will be shown in a self-contained demonstration that illustrates the complete and secure flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resultant software application will also be compliant with the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) architecture.&amp;nbsp; GMSEC is a software-based architecture built on a publish/subscribe messaging framework, which addresses many long-standing issues associated with point-solution implementations of mission control center systems.&lt;/p&gt;",
