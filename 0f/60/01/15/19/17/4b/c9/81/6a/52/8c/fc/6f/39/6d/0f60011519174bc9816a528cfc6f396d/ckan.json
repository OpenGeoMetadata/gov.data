  "notes": "Various resource projects have been conducted in the City of San Diego's Open Space Parks as part of the implementation of the City's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP). In 2004, vegetation mapping and sensitive species surveys were conducted by HELIX Environmental Planning, Inc. (HELIX) at the Tecolote Canyon Natural Park to establish baseline data for the park's Natural Resource Management Plan. These efforts were supported by a Local Assistance Grant from the CDFG. Efforts included vegetation mapping (presented in a separate data layer), mapping of exotic species, rare plant surveys and bird count surveys at Tecolote Canyon in spring 2004 (Andrea Bitterling, HELIX pers comm.). Rare plant surveys were conducted in May and included observations of sensitive animal species. Nine bird count stations were established throughout the Park based on ease of access (from nearby streets) and vegetation communities present (an effort was made to sample as many different communities as possibl HELIX also compiled biological resource data collected by Dudek & Associates and Tierra Environmental Services for emergency sewer repair projects conducted in the park (HELIX 2006). These data are also included. This datalayer presents the geospatial data collected from these surveys and was compiled for the Southern California Data Integration Project.
