  "notes": "The Distance Education Courses for Public Elementary and Secondary School Students, 2004-05 (FRSS 89), is a study that is part of the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) program; program data is available since 1998-99 at <http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/downloads.asp>. FRSS 89 (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a sample survey that provides national estimates for technology-based distance education courses in public elementary and secondary schools. The study was mailed to public school district superintendents, who were sampled for the survey. The study's response rate was 96 percent. Key statistics produced from the study were the percent of districts and the percent of schools (by instructional level) with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses. The number of enrollments in distance education courses (by instructional level) was also collected. The survey contained questions on the completion status of the enrollments in distance education. Districts were asked to report the technologies used to deliver distance education courses and where students accessed online distance education courses (e.g., at school or at home). The survey included questions on whether technology-based distance education was used to offer Advanced Placement (AP) and college-level courses to students. Districts with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses were asked whether they planned to expand their distance education courses.",
