  "notes": "The size and weight of the Northern hogsuckers collected from Big Creek generally decreased with distance upstream; specimens from Site 1 (below Annapolis) were generally largest and heaviest, and those from Site 4 (near Hogan) were generally smallest and lightest (Table 2). Among the metals analyzed by ICPES, concentrations of Be in carcass and of Cr in both blood and carcass were below detection levels in all or most samples (Appendix Table A1); however, Be was detected in blood from all fish collected at Sites 3 and 4, but in none from Sites 1 and 2 (Appendix Table A1). For measurable metals in fish carcasses, only concentrations of AL Cd, Ni and Pb differed among sites. Concentrations of Al were significantly (P < 0.05, Fischer's protected LSD) greater at Sites 2 (above Annapolis) and 4 (Hogan) than at Sites 1 (below Annapolis) and 3 (Glover--Table 2). Concentrations of Ni were significantly greater at Site 4 than at all others; conversely, the mean concentration of Cd was significantly lower at Site 4 than at all others (Table 2). Mean Pb concentrations were significantly greater at Sites 1 and 3 than at Sites 2 and 4 (Table 2). Among metals in blood, only mean concentrations of Cd and Pb differed significantly among sites (Table 3). For Cd, there was an obvious gradient of increasing concentrations from upstream to downstream; concentrations were lowest at Site 4 (Hogan) and greatest at Site 1 (below Annapolis--Table 3). For Pb, concentrations were significantly greater at Sites 1 (below Annapolis) and 3 (at Glover) than at Sites 2 and 4 (Table 3). Contemporaneous data collected by EPA-Region VII also showed elevated concentrations of Pb and Cd, as well as of Zn, at all Big Creek sites downstream of the smelter discharge (J. Pitt, personal communication). Mean ALA-D activity and ALA-D activity adjusted for Hb (ALA-D / Hb), but not Hb concentrations, differed significantly among sites (Table 3). As expected, ALA-D activity was greater at the sites with lowest blood and carcass Pb concentrations (Sites 2 and 4) than at the sites with elevated Pb (Sites 1 and 3--Table 3, Fig. 2). ALA-D activity was well-described by log-linear relations with blood- and carcass-lead concentrations, with the samples from each site grouped together (Fig. 2).",
