    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;BioSentinel technology will provide critical information about how living systems, from humans down to cells, adapt, respond and survive in deep space, beyond LEO furthering our understanding of radiation effects on biological systems and the potential countermeasures needed to enable future deep space exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; Using autonomous 6U Cubesats is an innovative, low-cost, low-risk, high pay-off approach to conduct research and technology investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA double-stranded-breaks (DSB) repair exhibits striking conservation of repair proteins from yeast to humans.&amp;nbsp; The BioSentinel project uses yeast not only because of its similarity to cells in higher organisms, but also because of 1) the well-established history of strains engineered to measure DSB repair, 2) yeast&amp;rsquo;s flight heritage, and 3) the wealth of available ground and flight reference data. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt; flight strain will contain engineered genetic defects to prevent growth and division until a radiation-induced DSB near (~1000 bases) the target genes activates the yeast&amp;rsquo;s DNA repair mechanisms: culture growth and metabolic activity will indicate directly a DSB and its successful repair.&amp;nbsp; In parallel, a different yeast strain that cannot repair DSBs will provide survival curves: increased space radiation-induced DSBs cause decreased cell survival. &amp;nbsp;Each of the multiple yeast strains is carried in multiple independent culture wells, subgroups of which are activated at multiple time points over a 6 &amp;ndash; 18-month mission.&amp;nbsp; The instrument monitors each subgroup of 12 culture wells continuously for 4 weeks, tracking cell growth via optical density and metabolic activity using a viability dye: &lt;em&gt;growth indicates DNA damage and repair&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A payload containment designed for minimal shielding of the cells provides biologically significant radiation doses in orbits beyond LEO.&amp;nbsp; Far higher doses can be expected during a solar particle event (SPE), triggering additional measurements by our biosensors.&amp;nbsp; The DSB rate in space will be compared to (a) physically measured radiation dose, (b) studies conducted in terrestrial radiation facilities, and (c) models of expected DNA damage-and-repair rates.&amp;nbsp; Due to the unique composition, flux, and energy distribution of space radiation, it is expected that the radiation-induced responses in space will differ from ground-based data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results will be critical for improving interpretation of the biological effects of space radiation exposure, and to reduce risk associated with long-duration human exploration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
