  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides a Class 100 ultra-clean environment for the cleaning, assembly, and acceptance testing of contamination-sensitive spacecraft components and integration of complete spacecraft subsystems. The facility is used primarily to support spacecraft propulsion systems, but has been used to support all spacecraft electrical, electronic, and mechanical subsystems. DESCRIPTION: The facility consists of two self-contained rooms that have a footprint of 44 &amp;#215; 43 &amp;#215; 13 ft and an additional area for mechanical equipment that covers an area 43 &amp;#215; 20 &amp;#215; 13 ft, for a total of 35,776 ft   3    .  The entire work area is airtight, pressurized, and dust-, temperature-, and humidity-controlled. It has two laminar flow rooms with an air velocity across the entire room of 100 to 120 ft/min. The air is filtered using HEPA filters to an absolute level of 0.3 m. The rooms are environmentally controlled using air conditioning to achieve 65&amp;#176; to 75 &amp;#176;F and 40% to 60% relative humidity. The rooms are maintained at a minimum 0.15 in. of water pressure differential with existing atmospheric conditions. Connected to the Class 100 clean room is the High Bay Clean Room, a Class 10,000, 35 &amp;#215; 35 &amp;#215; 25 ft room with an 18-ft roll-up door. It supports large spacecraft and propulsion system integration and houses the propulsion orbital tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding operations for plumbing systems. INSTRUMENTATION: The clean rooms are supported by an extensive array of special test equipment (STE) to support the needs of contamination-controlled testing and integration of spaceflight hardware. This STE consists of ultrasonic cleaning equipment, particle counting stations, water purification stations, vacuum drying stations, immersion flush stations, test hardware, electrical checkout stations, rinse stations, inert gas purges, dc power supplies, tooling and fixtures, and high- and low-pressure test panels for helium and nitrogen test gases. This STE has been recently upgraded to include a state-of-the-art spacecraft propulsion testbed with integrated sensor, hardware control, and data acquisition all controlled via a simplified GUI-based user interface. The testbed has over 70 channels of simultaneous data acquisition at rates up to 50,000 Hz for measurement of pressure, temperature, flow rates, and electrical signals.  ",
