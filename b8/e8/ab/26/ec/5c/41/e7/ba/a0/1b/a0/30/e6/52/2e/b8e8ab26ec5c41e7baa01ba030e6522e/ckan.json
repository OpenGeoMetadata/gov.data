  "notes": " Crew Station/Turret Motion Based Simulator (CS/TMBS) Test station simulates operational scenarios The CS/TMBS is a high-capacity six-degrees-of-freedom test device. The simulation framework enables engineers to quickly obtain key data and information on vehicle/Soldier performance with high quality. The simulator employs a virtual environment with computer-generated imagery and displays, a digital audio system, crew station controls, real-time computational dynamics and a network for synthetic battlefield operations. Capabilities This simulator is capable of reproducing dynamic conditions encountered by combat vehicle crew stations and turret systems traveling on secondary roads and cross-country terrain. Battlefield environments are reproduced to study Soldier and vehicle-in-the-loop issues in an operational setting well before developmental testing. Benefits &amp;#8226;  Repeatability and control over variables difficult to manage  at test centers and proving grounds. &amp;#8226;  Gun turret drive characterization and control system  algorithm development in a laboratory setting. &amp;#8226;  Soldier- and hardware-in-the-loop experimentation, plus  power and energy management work for risk reduction. &amp;#8226;  Baseline versus modified studies in a quick q  uantitative fashion. Vehicle Inertial Properties Evaluation Rig (VIPER) Measures system/subsystem inertial characteristics and center of gravity (COG) The VIPER is used to accurately measure system and subsystem inertial characteristics and COG for trucks, trailers and turrets, generally without modification or disassembly. It consists of a configurable platform capable of rotating in roll, pitch and yaw, as well as the software necessary to post-process the results. Capabilities The VIPER is capable of determining various parameters including vehicle COG, mass moments of inertia, total vehicle weight and roll/yaw mass product of inertia. The COG measurements are accurate to &amp;#177;1%, the momentof inertia measurements to &amp;#177;3%, and the weight and axle loads to &amp;#177;0.5%. The VIPER is capable of measuring vehicles weighing between 1,500 and 60,000 lbs, and can accommodate vehicles up to 120 inches wide and 430 inches in length. Setup and test execution takes approximately three to five days. Benefits &amp;#8226;  Mass property measurements made are an essential  component for developing realistic dynamics models when solid modeling is not an option due to cost or availability. &amp;#8226;  The VIPER directly impacts vehicle rollover analysis/  prediction, vehicle stability/handling/ride, turret drive/control, transportability assessments, suspension tuning/design, vehicle data plate information, design trade-off analysis, durability and failure analysis, accident reconstruction and vehicle configuration change management.
