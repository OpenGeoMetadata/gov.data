  "notes": "Bulk element concentrations in soil collected from undisturbed forested sites throughout the Kiamichi River watershed above Hugo Reservoir were significantly higher in aluminum, arsenic, chromium, iron, lead, manganese and zinc than Kiamichi River sediment. There was no difference between soil and sediment with respect to copper, magnesium and nickel, cadmium, selenium and mercury could not be compared due to lack of detection in a sufficient number of samples. Geochemical normalization of soil and sediment data revealed that copper, magnesium, manganese and nickel were apparently enriched in sediment, whereas arsenic and lead were depleted. There was no difference with respect to chromium, iron or zinc. A comparison of element concentrations in the Kiamichi River sediment with guidelines suggested for the protection of benthic organisms indicated that sediments in this section of the river are not likely to be harmful. Significant differences in the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron, lead, magnesium and zinc were found between shoots and roots of water willow; whereas concentrations of aluminum, copper, manganese and nickel were similar in the two types of tissue. Mercury and selenium were not detected in plant tissues. Water willow did not bioaccumulate elements from sediments. Measurable concentrations of aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, selenium and zinc were found in all three species of mussels. In general, intraspecific variation for each element was low compared to soil, sediment and water willow tissues. Significant interspecific differences were found for all elements except aluminum, magnesium and mercury. Bioaccumulation was greater in mussels than in plants. Element concentrations in mussels from the Kiamichi River were comparable to those from non-contaminated areas. A base monitoring program, using the mussel Amblema plicata is recommended for determining long-term changes in element concentrations in the Kiamichi River ecosystem. Samples collected every ten years at seven different sites along the river could be analyzed by the same methods employed in this study at a total cost of approximately $4.000. Resource managers could undertake appropriate, more specific measures to determine the location, cause and possible effects in the event of significant increases.",
