  "notes": "This dataset contains 4 Band (RGBI) digital orthophoto imagery of Cass, Crow Wing, Hubbard, Mahnomen, Wadena, southern Clearwater and eastern Becker counties in north central Minnesota. The orthophotos are 0.5-meter ground sample distance (GSD) and are in UTM Zone 15, NAD83 (meters). The tiling format of the imagery is based on a 3.75 x 3.75 quarter quadrangle with a 130-meter buffer on all four sides. The digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs) are in GeoTiff format with an associated world file. All imagery was collected by Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc. with a Microsoft UltraCam Eagle camera from an altitude of approximately 25,000. All imagery was processed by Keystone using the camera manufacturer's software, Inpho's photogrammetry suite and Keystone created software. This metadata record was created by MnGeo using information supplied by DNR and Keystone Aerial Surveys Inc.",
