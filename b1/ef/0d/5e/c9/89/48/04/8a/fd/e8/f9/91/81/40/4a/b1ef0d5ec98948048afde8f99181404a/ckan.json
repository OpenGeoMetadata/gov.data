  "notes": "Snow vehicles operated by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company Alyeska traveled from the Dalton Highway into Atigun Gorge in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in November, 2003, creating a highlyvisible trail of crushed vegetation and disrupted soil. The trail is in one of the most commonly visited areas of the Refuge. This report describes the results of our initial assessment of impacts conducted in August 2004.Alyeska contracts with Air Logistics Co. to fly regular helicopter surveys over the TransAlaska Pipeline. On November 22, 2003, a helicopter was forced to land in Atigun Gorge due to bad weather, approximately 4.3 km 2.7 miles east of the pipeline and Dalton Highway and 3 km 2 miles inside the Arctic Refuge. The helicopter was about 7 km 4.5 miles from Alyeska Pump Station 4 and a Tucker 1644E Snow Cat was sent from the station to retrieve the pilot. The Tucker traveled on the frozen Atigun River, but on the return trip it was disabled when it broke through the river ice and sustained damaged. A second Tucker was then dispatched to the site. It traveled on the river for the first 1.6 km 1 mile and then crossed tundra for at least 1.6 km 1 mile to avoid the river ice. The first Tucker was repaired and both vehicles then returned to Pump Station 4 following the tundra route. Alyeska Incident Report 2003IR5550 Attachment 1 was filed internally and the Joint Pipeline Office was notified, but the incident was not reported to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service USFWS.On June 9, 2004, two USFWS biologists hiked into Atigun Gorge to conduct a Dall Sheep survey and discovered the obvious trail left by the Tuckers. On June 16 two other USFWS personnel visited the site and determined that the tracks were clearly from a vehicle too large to have been a recreational vehicle. In conducting an investigation of the incident, USFWS contacted Alyeska and received a copy of the incident report.USFWS biologists visited the site on August 10  11, 2004 to assess impacts to Refuge resources. Sampling was conducted in August when vegetation had reached peak biomass and greenness to facilitate future monitoring of recovery. Vegetation cover changes too rapidly in early summer to allow year to year comparisons.Impacts to vegetation and soils were assessed using two approaches. First, a rapid semiquantitative assessment was conducted over the entire known trail to quantify the overall level of inpact. Second, permanent intensive plots were established to better quantify changes in plant species composition and to provide baseline data for monitoring recovery. We plan to repeat the sampling in 2005 and then at two or three year intervals to track recovery over time. This report presents the results of the first years sampling.",
