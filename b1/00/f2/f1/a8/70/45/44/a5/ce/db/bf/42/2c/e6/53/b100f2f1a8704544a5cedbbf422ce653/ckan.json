  "notes": "The database represents delineations of aspen stands associated with stand assessment data (LASSEN_NF_EAGLELAKE_PTS) collected in aspen stands in the in the Eagle Lake Ranger District, Lassen National Forest, Lassen County, California. Data were gathered during the summers of 2001-2005. Observations were conducted by trained Forest Service crews. Assessments were conducted within aspen stands in the region, or stands identified during field surveys. This dataset is considered to be a complete inventory of aspen in these watersheds, based on the extensive effort to survey all stands in the region. Aspen stands were assessed and delineated using a protocol developed by the lead investigators at the Eagle Lake Ranger District. Assessments included information describing the ecological condition of the aspen stand, and if browsing of the aspen was present or absent. Associated with this polygon layer is a point layer (LASSEN_NF_EAGLELAKE_PTS) containing aspen stand assessments conducted in conjunction with the aspen stand delineations. Data Compilation: The Aspen Delineation Project (ADP) is a collaborative effort of the U.S. Forest Service's Pacific Southwest Region, the California Department of Fish and Games Resource Assessment Program, and the California Office of Bureau of Land Management. Principal Investigator for ADP is David Burton; visit: www.aspensite.org for more information regarding the ADP. The Department of Fish and Games, Resource Assessment Program compiled this information from the collaborating agencies and other researchers, and formatted the data into a common database for the purpose of facilitating access to data related to the conservation of Quaking Aspen in California. This information portal falls within the ADP goals to help agencies and land managers identify, map, treat, and monitor aspen habitats. This dataset is a portion of a master database compiled during a year long effort in 2005 to pull together current GIS layers and",
