    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;To finalize a comprehensive NASA Cis-Lunar / Earth-Moon Libration Orbit Reference and Web Application begun using FY13 IRAD funding approved in May 2013. This GSFC reference will be available as a searchable web-based application to explore design options and generate essential trajectory data permitting both astrodynamics experts and non-experts (proposal teams and systems designers) to determine useable trajectories in the Earth-Moon (EM) system. It can be used by HQ management, JSC&amp;rsquo;s DSH habitat concept teams, HEOMD, and other analysis teams to develop designs without performing numerous time-consuming point designs or trades. Completing such a reference would maintain GSFC&amp;rsquo;s leadership role in EM libration orbit design and operations while providing other study teams with instant designs and quotes on mission design parameters such as delta-V (DV), propellant budgets, mission durations, launch requirements, and libration-orbit parameters. The related objectives of this study fall into four specific categories: detailed analysis of transfers; orbital maintenance and evolution; and application to a variety of other mission types, e.g. distant retrograde orbits useful for human exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide Detailed Analysis of EM libration transfers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This effort includes direct transfers, transfers using lunar gravity assist, and &amp;nbsp;transfers via multi-body dynamics (manifolds) to reach EM L&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; orbits. This analysis would cover the entire design space and complete trades for any and all transfers to/from EM L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and EM L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and transfers between them. The current design process can be painstakingly slow, especially for point design using numerical simulations. We will apply the successful IRAD Adaptive Trajectory Design (ATD) tool to assist in generating most of these designs. Working with Purdue University would allow us to generate complete families of transfers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide Stationkeeping and Evolution Analysis of all EM libration orbit types: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This includes any orbit type (quasi-halo, halo, Lissajous, Lyapunov orbits, rectilinear, etc.). With the recent operational support of ARTEMIS, which maintained two spacecraft in both EM L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;and EM L&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;orbits, we implemented an optimal stationkeeping strategy that minimized DV requirements. But ARTEMIS represents only a subset of all possible orbits and constraints. We need to examine not only the stationkeeping of various EM orbit types, but also the perturbation effects of un-modeled or mis-modeled s/c properties such as momentum management and response to environmental conditions on our stationkeeping methods and navigation performance. The result of such a study would be to document &amp;Delta;V budgets required for all EM libration orbit types, providing any team with ready access to critical mission planning data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Explore Lunar resonant orbits and Distant Retrograde Orbits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (DROs). These orbit designs are becoming more popular with missions such as TESS using a resonant orbit and the Asteroid Return Mission using a DRO. These orbits can also have stable/unstable manifolds which we can apply to our design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop an Interactive Web Catalog. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A development of a broadly useful NASA Cis-Lunar / Earth-Moon Libration online catalog necessary for use across NASA. Such an orbit reference does not currently exist. It will be populated by the analysis and algorithms from the objectives above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
