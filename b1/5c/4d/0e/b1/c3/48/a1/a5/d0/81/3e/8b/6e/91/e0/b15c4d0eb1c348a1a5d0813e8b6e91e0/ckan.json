  "notes": "This is a data set of point emission sources of volatiles from operations that have Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2911, Petroleum Refining. Establishments possessing this SIC classification are primarily engaged in producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils, and lubricants, through fractionation or straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking or other processes. Establishments with this code also produce aliphatic and aromatic chemicals as by-products. These data were derived from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) Emission Inventory System (EIS) source data. In Louisiana, any facility in an (ozone level) attainment area that has the potential to emit at least 100 tons per year (tpy) of any contaminant [including volatile organic compounds (VOC)] for which a National Ambient Air Quality Standard has been issued or any facility in a marginal, moderate, or serious ozone nonattainment area that has the potential to emit at least 10 tpy of VOC, 25 tpy of nitrogen oxides (NOx), or 100 tpy of carbon monoxide (CO), or any facility that has the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC in an area designated as an Ozone Adjoining Area to a listed, moderate, or serious ozone nonattainment area or any facility defined as a major stationary source of hazardous air pollutants in Section 112(a)(1) of the Federal Clean Air Act must submit annual reports to LDEQ. It is from these reports that these facilities and point emission sources are inventoried and tracked.",
