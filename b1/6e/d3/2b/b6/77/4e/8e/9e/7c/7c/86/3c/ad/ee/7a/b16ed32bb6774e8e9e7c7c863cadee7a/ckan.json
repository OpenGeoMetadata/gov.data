  "notes": "The Water Information Management and Analysis System (WIMAS) is an ArcView based GIS application that allows users to query Kansas water right data maintained by the Kansas Department of Agriculture, Division of Water Resources (KDA-DWR). Using a shape file representing points of water diversion that is developed from SQL queries to the KDA-DWR's ORACLE-based Water Rights Information System (WRIS), WIMAS users can summarize total authorized quantity and annual reported water usage for Kansas counties, subbasins, user-defined study areas, or individual water rights. WIMAS consists of two customized Graphical User Interfaces and several forms developed from Avenue and the Dialog Designer Extension for ArcView. The output options of WIMAS allows users to print hardcopy outputs or export their queries into other applications in the form of text reports, graphs, and maps.",

Information contained in the WIMAS program is a public record; however, by accessing the WIMAS program, associated data, and any products generated by WIMAS (i.e. maps, graphs, tables, and reports) the user agrees that they will not use them for selling, or offering the sale, of any property or services in violation of K.S.A 45-220(c)(2). The use of the PD.SHP file outside of the WIMAS program is strongly discouraged without a strong understanding of both water rights in general and the KDA-DWR's ORACLE database modeling rules and structure. Water rights are dynamic and often complex entities. The water rights data used in WIMAS represents the water rights files as of certain date and should not be viewed as current. Reported water use information used in WIMAS at this time represents only a single calender year. Information provided in WIMAS can not be used to determine whether a water right has been lawfully used in accordance with the terms, conditions and limitations specified in the vested right, certificate or permit. To obtain current standing information on a particular water right file, please contact the DWR. The term \\\"status\\\", as used in the WIMAS program, denotes one of the following phases of a water right's development: (1) The application is pending initial review by the KDA-DWR; (2) A permit has been issued; (3) The KDA-DWR has received a notice and proof of completion of the diversion works; (4) The time to perfect the water right has expired; (5) A Certificate of Appropriation has been issued; or (6) The water right has been dismissed for some reason.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
