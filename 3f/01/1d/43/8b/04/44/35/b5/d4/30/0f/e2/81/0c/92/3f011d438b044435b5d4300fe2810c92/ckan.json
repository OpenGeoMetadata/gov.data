    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed innovation is an aircraft flight envelope monitoring system\nthat will provide real-time in-cockpit estimations of aircraft flight\nenvelope boundaries, performance, and controllability.  The adaptable\nmonitoring system will provide information on current and predicted\naircraft performance and controllability, alerting the pilot to any\naerodynamic degradation of the control effectiveness.  This includes\nhigh angle-of-attack, heavy rain, in-flight icing encounters,\nenvironmental contamination of surfaces, and structural or battle\ndamage.  The real-time monitoring system measures the time-averaged and\nRMS control surface hinge moment from all aircraft aerodynamic controls.\nControl surface hinge moment is sensitive to the aerodynamic\ncharacteristics of the flying surface, including separation.  These data\nare processed and information on the current and predicted future state\nof aircraft control (including asymmetric cases) is made available to\nthe pilot or flight management system.  As opposed to other single-point\nmonitoring systems, the proposed system has the distinct advantage that\nit functions by measuring the integrated effect over the entire control\nsurface.  The use of real-time control surface hinge moment monitoring\nis an innovative and robust concept for predicting aircraft flight\nenvelope boundaries and controllability.",
