    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The second release of collection 3 OMI/Aura Level-2 NO2 data product OMNO2 is now available (http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omno2_v003.shtml ) to public and science community from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).\n      \n      The Nitrogen Dioxide Product 'OMNO2' contains slant column NO2 (total amount along the optical path from the sun into the atmosphere, and then toward the satellite), the total vertical column NO2, the estimated tropospheric contribution to the total NO2 column, NO2 column hidden by any clouds in the OMI field of view, and other ancillary data.\n      \n      Nitrogen dioxide is an important chemical species in both the stratosphere, where it plays a key role in ozone chemistry, and in the troposphere, where it is a precursor to ozone production. In the troposphere, it is produced in various combustion processes and in lightning and is an indicator of poor air quality.\n      \n      (The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column NO2 product is OMNO2) \n\t    \n\t    The algorithm leads for this product are NASA OMI scientist Dr. Nickolay A. Krotkov and KNMI Scientist Dr.Pepijn J. Veefkind. \n      \n      OMNO2 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMNO2 data product is about 15 Mbytes.\n                  \n      Data Category &Parameters:\n      \n      The OMNO2 data file contains one swath which consists of two groups:\n      \n      Data fields:\n      Slant Column NO2 (total amount along the optical path from the sun into the \n      atmosphere and then toward the satellite), The Total Vertical Column NO2, and \n      the Estimated Tropospheric Contribution to the Total Column NO2, and Other \n      Ancillary Data including Data Quality Flags, Measures of Precision, Quality \n      Assurance (QA) information.\n      \n      Geolocation Fields:\n      Latitude, Longitude, Time, Relative Azimuth, Solar Zenith andAzimuth,       \n      Viewing Zenith and Azimuth angles, Spacecraft Altitude, Latitude, \n      Longitude, Terrain Height, Ground Pixel Quality Flags.",
