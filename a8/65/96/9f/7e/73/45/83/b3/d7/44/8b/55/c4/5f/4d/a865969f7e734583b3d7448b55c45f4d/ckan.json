  "notes": "This database includes gauging stations, climatic data centers, and storet sites. The accuracy of the locations is dependent on the source data for each of the databases. The coverages include: 1. KGSWL 足 Water level wells in the KGS and USGS databases. Also included are the GMD number in which the well islocated (if it is a GMD, 0, otherwise) and the Water Level Report Region the well is in (from the water levels report published by KGS, annually). Source: KGS Water Level Database 2. NCDC 足 Weather data collection locations maintained by The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, NC. Information includes the period of record (up to Feb. 1991, the last available data), the type of data collected at each site, WBAN number, and the site elevation. Source: NCDC \"Summary of the Day\" data provided by EARTHINFO, Boulder CO. 3. EPAKS 足 All STORET (EPA database) sampling sites which are identified as being in Kansas. Information includes the agency FIPS code for the collecting agency, begin date of data storage, and type (as defined by STORET) of data collection. There were 25 sites in the STORET database identified as Kansas locations without correct latitude and longitude data. These were not included. Note: STORET is a user maintained database. Locational information can vary in quality from entry to entry. Some locations may be GPS accurate, others may be a Zip Code centrum. Source: STORET database located on the USEPA'S National Computing Center IBM 3090. Retrieved by the Project PI. 4. USGSSW 足 USGS Surface Water gauging station locations in Kansas. Information includes the station's drainage area. Source: USGS Basin Characteristics File, supplied by the National Water Data Exchange, Reston, VA.",
