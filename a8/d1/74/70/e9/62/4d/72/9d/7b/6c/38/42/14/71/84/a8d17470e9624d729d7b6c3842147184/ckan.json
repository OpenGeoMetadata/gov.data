    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;With the cost of planetary exploration rising and budgets for such missions declining newer, cheaper, i.e. low mass, systems must be developed to perform exploration. Currently, small scientific beds which perform limited tasks are being developed and launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in the form of small-scale satellite units, i.e. CubeSats, utilizing solar-based power. However, if a reasonable propulsion system could be developed, these low cost CubeSat platforms could be used to perform exploration of various extra-terrestrial bodies within the solar system; such as Europa. Current standard propulsion technology does not provide the complete answer. Chemical-based systems are high mass and provide insufficient performance for deep space missions. Electric propulsion (EP) is very efficient, i.e. high Isp, but has low thrust, leading to long mission times if orbital maneuvering is required. Thermal propulsion (TP) yields high thrust, but at the expense of a high consumption rate of propellant. Therefore, pairing an EP and TP system into a dual-mode propulsion unit becomes beneficial, where the strengths of each system are used appropriately. The high thrusting capabilities of the thermal mode are ideal for quick Earth orbit escape, drastic orbital maneuvering and orbital insertion at location. The high efficiency of the electric-mode is ideal for interplanetary travel. Researchers at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) are proposing a radioisotope-based, dual-mode, low mass propulsion system for a CubeSat payload capable of extending their exploration realm out of LEO. Such an integrated propulsion system would allow for beneficial exploration to be conducted, even within the current budget limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the proposed work a complete system design will be provided, optimized&amp;nbsp;for a Europa destination with a 10 kg payload. Modeling software such as AGI STK, COMSOL, MALTO and Aspen will be used to&amp;nbsp;design and optimize the various components of the overall system. The design of an experiment will also be conducted to use existing&amp;nbsp;CSNR hardware to evaluate propellant performance within the thermal mode.&lt;/p&gt;",
