    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The ESMRN5IM data product consists of daily brightness temperature images on 70-mm photofacsimile film. Each frame contains a geographic grid and two groups of three parallel strips of imagery, each containing one-half the orbital data. The spatial coverage is identical in each group, but each strip has a different dynamic range for its gray scale: 100-200 K, 190-270 K, and 250-300 K, respectively. The spatial resolution is 25 x 25 km near nadir, degrading to 160 km cross-track by 45 km down-track at the ends of the scan. The images are saved as JPEG 2000 digital files. About 2 weeks of images are archived into a TAR file. Additional information can be found in \"The Nimbus 5 User's Guide.\"\n\nThe primary objectives of the Nimbus 5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) were: (1) to derive the liquid water content of clouds from brightness temperatures over oceans, (2) to observe differences between sea ice and the open sea over the polar caps, and (3) to test the feasibility of inferring surface composition and soil moisture. To accomplish these objectives, the ESMR was capable of continuous global mapping of the 1.55-cm (19.36 GHz) microwave radiation emitted by the earth/atmosphere system, and could function even in the presence of cloud conditions that block conventional satellite infrared sensors. The ESMR experiment made measurements from Dec. 11, 1972 until May 16, 1977.These images can be used to supplement the radiance data files from the ESMRN5L2 data product.",
