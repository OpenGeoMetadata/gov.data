  "notes": "In 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) designated approximately 6600 ha (16,308 ac) of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the San Luis Valley (SLV) as Solar Energy Zones (SEZs) through the Approved Resources Management Plan/Record of Decision (ROD) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States (BLM 2012a). SEZs are solar energy development focus areas with high intensity solar radiation (>6.0 kw/m2/day) and where land use priority includes generation of renewable energy to meet national energy diversification and climate change goals. The four SEZs in the SLV include: 1) De Tilla Gulch, approximately 4.3 km2 (1,064 ac), located in Saguache County; 2) Los Mogotes East, approximately 10.7 km2 (2,650 ac), located in Conejos County; 3) Antonito Southeast, approximately 39.4 km2 (9,712 ac), also located in Conejos County; and 4) Fourmile East, approximately 11.7 km2 (2,882 ac), located in Alamosa County (Fig. 1). The SLV, with the Rio Grande and Conejos rivers and a wide array of wetland complexes, is a major migratory flyway for wetland birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703–712). The Draft/Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States (BLM 2010, 2012b) identified direct and indirect effects of solar energy development on wildlife, primarily habitat loss/alteration, disturbance from human presence, temporary and chronic noise disturbance, and injuries and mortalities. Of particular concern to migratory birds is the potential for behavioral attraction to solar energy facilities that reflect the sun, which may result in injury or death via collisions with infrastructure, exposure to fire, and burning at standby points (McCrary et al. 1986). In 2014, the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory released the findings of a study on bird mortality at three solar energy facilities using different solar technologies—photovoltaic, trough system with parabolic mirrors, and power tower—in southern California (Kagan et al. 2014). They reported injury and mortality at all three solar facilities from impact trauma (from collisions with solar panels), solar flux (resulting in burning), and predation. They documented mortality for 233 individual birds of 71 species, from a variety of taxa including waterbirds (e.g., grebes, coots, pelicans, cormorants, gulls) and shorebirds (e.g., avocets, herons, sandpipers). To protect the diverse bird life in the SLV from impacts of solar energy facilities, the BLM contracted Animas Biological Studies (ABS) to conduct waterbird/shorebird surveys prior to the development of the four SEZs. The results of these surveys will inform the BLM on the diversity and abundance of migratory waterbirds and shorebirds using the SLV as well as to guide the development of mitigations and management recommendations for avian protection during construction and operation of proposed solar energy facilities.",
