    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Aerospace structures are prone to damage. In addition to cracks seen in metals, composite structures exhibit other characteristic damage modes such as, matrix cracking, delamination, fiber debonding and breakage and matrix voids. Infrared thermography methods can reveal many subsurface defects in composites including kissing disbond, which is almost impossible to identify using any other NDE method. However, no matter how complex and quantitative it may be, the information obtained through a typical NDE technique is limited to the state of damage when the inspection is performed. The growth of this damage during the service life on the other hand greatly affects the integrity of the component and may lead to catastrophic failure. In this program we will take the information provided by the NDE methods to one step further and use the IR image data obtained during regular maintenance routines to determine/predict the remaining usable life of the structure. Moreover, to facilitate practical use of the system, the ultimate goal of this project will be to provide this capability in a compact Portable IR-based Inspection System package, PIRIS. Phase I program will be based on demonstrating the feasibility of the concept through an extensive experimental program. At the end of Phase II a prototype system will be delivered to the NASA program manager. In this NASA SBIR program, MTC has partnered with Pratt&amp;Whitney. Their hands-on involvement will provide the required technical/practical guidance to make PIRIS system a success.  ",
