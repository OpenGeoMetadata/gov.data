    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tCurrent water quality monitors aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are specialized and provide limited data. The Colorimetric Water Quality Monitor Kit (CWQMK) and the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) are used to measure biocide concentrations and the total organic carbon load, respectively.&amp;nbsp; While each of these instruments provides important analytical information, they lack the ability to fully characterize the organic and inorganic compounds present in the ISS water systems.&amp;nbsp; Identification of individual compounds requires the return of ISS archival samples that are analyzed in ground laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tA survey of the other environmental monitoring hardware used on the ISS reveals that air quality monitors have advanced further toward the end goal of providing real-time, compound-specific information that can be used by the crew. As many of the organic compounds on the target lists for air and water quality monitoring are identical, evaluating the current air quality monitoring technologies is a logical first step toward development of a water quality platform that can characterize the organic load in spacecraft water systems. The initial phase of this effort is focused on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). IMS technology was previously used in the ISS Volatile Organic Analyzer (VOA), and it is employed for numerous terrestrial applications, such as the detection of a variety of large analytes in aqueous solution. It also is widely field-deployed by the Department of Homeland Security for explosives detection.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tOur approach couples IMS with electrospray ionization (ESI) to ionize and detect target analytes in water samples. The successful completion of this work could potentially allow for the analysis of both air and water samples using a single instrument.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
