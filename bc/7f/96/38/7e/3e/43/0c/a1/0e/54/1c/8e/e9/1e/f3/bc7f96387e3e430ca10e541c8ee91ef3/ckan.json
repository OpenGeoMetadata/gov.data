  "notes": " The Fire Control Systems &amp;amp; Technology Directorate&amp;#39;s 89,000 square-foot Armament Software Engineering Center (Armament SEC) is an Army Material Command Chartered Life Cycle Software Engineering Center. The Armament SEC provides the US Soldier, RDECOM, Joint Ammunition Life Cycle Management Center, Soldier/Ground Systems Life Cycle Management Center, resident PEO/PMs and other customers a Center of Excellence for software engineering services and software acquisition support for Army Weapon Systems, Training Devices and Combat Support Systems throughout the entire system life cycle. The Armament SEC serves as a voting member of the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) for all software released by ARDEC and resident PMs. The Armament SEC chairs the Weapon System Technical Working Group for the DoD Information Standards Registry (DISR) and the Weapon System Technical Architecture Working Group.   The Armament SEC applies requirements definition analysis, architectural design, systems software design and analysis, software engineering and integration, software verification testing, software fielding, software acquisition support, configuration management, and process assurance towards weapons and munitions, training devices, chemical/biological detectors. The M109A6 self-propelled howitzer &amp;quot; Paladin Automatic Fire Control System, Paladin AFCS PC-Based Trainer, the Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS), the Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) and the M1A1 Abrams Ballistic Computer are among some of the software intensive systems that the Armament SEC has recently developed or updated and fielded. Additional software development and acquisition support programs of the Armament SEC include the M777A1 Towed Artillery Digitization, America&amp;#39;s Army &amp;quot; the official game of the US Army, Multi-purpose Integrated Chemical Agent Detector (MICAD), SPIDER Networked Munition, Excalibur, Precision Guided Mortar Munitions (PGMM), and Intelligent Munitions System (IMS). When systems are no longer in production, the Armament SEC supplies Post Production Software Support (PPSS) services to maintain the software and software baseline for the Army.   The Armament SEC was the first organization in the world to achieve a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 rating for systems engineering, software engineering, and acquisition disciplines in February 2002. The achievement of CMMI Level 3 resulted in the highest customer satisfaction ratings ever achieved by the Center. Currently, the Armament SEC is in the process of preparing to conduct a CMMI Level 4/5 appraisal in the spring 2006.  ",
