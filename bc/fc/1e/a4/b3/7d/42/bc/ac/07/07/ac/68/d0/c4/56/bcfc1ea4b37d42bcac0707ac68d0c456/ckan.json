  "notes": " \n        The IMAGINE program was designed to improve educational outcomes of girls in Niger. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funded IMAGINE as a component of its three-year Threshold Program in Niger (NTP) dedicated to reducing corruption, registering more businesses, promoting land titling, and increasing girls' school enrollment, attendance, and completion rates. In December 2009, MCC suspended the NTP in the midst of implementation due to undemocratic actions undertaken by the government. Although most of the NTP components were not sufficiently implemented to allow for a rigorous evaluation of their intended impacts, the girls' education project had been substantially implemented by that time and was thus the focus of both a one-year follow-up evaluation and a three-year long-term evaluation.\n\nThis impact evaluation sought to answer four key questions about whether or not the IMAGINE investments have been sustainable:\n\n1.  What is the current availability of and functionality of the infrastructure constructed under the IMAGINE project?\n2.  Did the IMAGINE project have any lasting impacts on key educational outcomes?\n      a.  What is the impact on primary education enrollment?\n      b.  What is the impact on attendance rates?\n      c.  What is the impact on learning as measured by test scores?\n      d.  What is the impact on other measures of education quality?\n3.  Are the impacts different for girls than for boys?\n4.  Are the impacts different for children from households of different socioeconomic status?\n\nThe evaluation design selected to estimate the impacts of the IMAGINE program was random assignment. The Government of Niger (GON) chose 204 villages to take part in random assignment for the IMAGINE project based on certain eligibility criteria, such as the number of school-aged girls in the village, access to water within the village, and proximity to a transportation route. Ultimately, only 201 villages participated in random assignment, because three villages were selected to receive treatment prior to random assignment. \n\nSixty-five schools were randomly selected to receive the IMAGINE program; the remaining 136 served as control villages. Because the villages were randomly assigned treatment status, villages that received the schools (treatment villages) and villages that did not (control villages) did not systematically differ at the outset of the program. Hence, any subsequent differences in outcomes observed between these two groups of villages can be attributed to the program itself and not to other factors. This design, if properly implemented, is methodologically strong and is seen by many as the gold standard of impact evaluation methods.\n\nThe evaluation conducted in 2011 found that IMAGINE had a 4.3 percentage point positive impact on primary school enrollment, no impact on attendance, and no impact on math and French test scores. The program impacts were generally larger for girls than for boys. For girls, the program had an 8 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a 5.4 percentage point impact on attendance. The program had no impact on girls' math scores, though there is suggestive evidence it may have had a positive impact of 0.09 standard deviations on girls' French test scores. No significant impacts were detected for boys' enrollment, attendance, or test scores. Finally, impacts were larger for younger children (ages 7-10), than for those between the ages of 10 and 12.\n\nThe evaluation conducted in fall 2013 found IMAGINE had an 8.3 percentage point positive impact on primary school enrollment during the 2012-2013 school year, a 7.9 percentage point decrease in children being absent more than two consecutive weeks during the same school year, a 0.13 standard deviation impact on math test scores, and no impact on French test scores. The project impacts were larger for girls than for boys. For girls, the project had an 11.8 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a 10.6 percentage point impact on attendance, whereas for boys the project had a 5.0 percentage point impact on enrollment and a 5.3 percentage point impact on attendance. The difference in impacts between the genders was statistically significant for both enrollment and attendance. For learning, the impacts on math and French test scores for girls were consistently large and statistically significant, whereas the impacts for boys were smaller and not significant. Impacts on math test scores for girls were 0.11 standard deviations higher than for boys, whereas differences in impacts for the French test between the genders were not statistically significant.\n      ",
