  "notes": "The Region 2 SEMS_CERCLIS Sites All [R2] GIS layer contains unique Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) site records. These records have the following NPL_STATUS designations: CURRENTLY ON FINAL NPL, DELETED FROM FINAL NPL, NOT ON NPL, PROPOSED FOR NPL, REMOVED FROM PROPOSED NPL, and SITE IS PART OF NPL SITE. The Region 2 SEMS_CERCLIS NPL Sites [R2] GIS layer only has SEMS records with the following NPL_STATUS designations: 'CURRENTLY ON FINAL NPL', 'DELETED FROM FINAL NPL', 'PROPOSED FOR NPL'. The Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) is EPA's \"official record\" for tracking hazardous waste sites, potentially hazardous waste sites, and remedial activities performed in support of the Superfund Program across the nation. This includes sites that are on the National Priorities List (NPL) or are being considered for the NPL. SEMS represents a joint development and ongoing collaboration between Superfund's Remedial, Removal, Federal Facilities, Enforcement, and Emergency Response programs. It provides its wide audience base with a means of ongoing analysis of Superfund Program activities and informational needs at the site, regional management, and national management levels. The customers of SEMS or SEMS data are five EPA Headquarters offices and regional staff, citizens, the regulated community, other Federal agencies, States, Tribes, local agencies, and industry. SEMS stakeholders are States, Congress, other Federal agencies, industry groups, and citizens. The informal partnerships established with Federal, State, local government, and industry groups are key to the reliability and tracking of environmental cleanup data and ultimate protection of human health and the environment. SEMS is an adaptive and tailored technical solution that is transforming the Superfund program by improving operational effectiveness, reducing costs, streamlining business processes, and enhancing information management capabilities. The solution serves as a model for how the Federal Government serves the public, the regulated community and partner agencies alike. All data for EPA Region 2 Regulated Facility GIS layers are extracted from the Facility Registry System (FRS) of Envirofacts on a monthly basis using R2GIS SQL procedures and Linked Server definitions. The attributes for each media specific R2GIS Regulated Facility layer provides the ID, name, address and environmental interest (permit designation or regulated activity) from the parent media program system and the best available coordinates from the FRS Geospatial Tables except for the Region 2 CERLIS layers were all locational data is from the CERCLIS database only. There are a small percentage of EPA Regulated Facilities for which no coordinate information has been registered in any of the related EPA or State Program System Databases. These facilities will have attribute table records in the Facility GIS layer but will not appear as points in the display map. For the much larger set of program system records with coordinates there may be a small subset of facilities having multiple records for the same facility in the layer. This can be due to multiple environmental interests registered over time for the same permit (e.g. AIR Major to Minor, RCRA Small Quantity Generator to Large Quantity Generator). A facility may also have been issued multiple program system IDs under the same EPA Program overtime. In either of these cases there will be more than one record with the same coordinates in a R2 Regulated Facility GIS layer and will result in stacked points on the GIS display.",
