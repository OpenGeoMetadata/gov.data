    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "3D visualization has proven effective at orienting remote ground controllers about robots operating on a planetary surface.  Using such displays, controllers can watch a robot move through surface terrain maps and react to objects in that terrain.  Readings taken in the robot's surroundings can be overlaid on terrain maps to improve human understanding.  3D visualization, however, focuses a controller's attention on what is happening in the vicinity of the robot.  The effectiveness of visualization at centering attention on the robot means that information not spatially linked to that view could be missed.  TRACLabs, Carnegie Mellon University, and Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies propose to develop software for notifying users of 3D visualization about important new information that may not be spatially linked to the current view.  We will identify use cases where notification is needed when using 3D visualization and design software for constructing and presenting notices for these use cases.  We will evaluate this design for use in K10 rover operations by defining an approach for integrating notification with the Visual Environment for Remote Virtual Exploration (VERVE). The extensive experience of this team in developing advanced software for robotic surface operations will contribute to the timely delivery of the proposed technology.",
