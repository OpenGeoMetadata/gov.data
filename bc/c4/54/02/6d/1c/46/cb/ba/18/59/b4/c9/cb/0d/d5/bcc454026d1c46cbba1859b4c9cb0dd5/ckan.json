  "notes": " CSI was established to harness the intellectual and physical capital of the Army&amp;#39;s organic Research, Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs) to conduct robust systems development and integration using a repeatable systems engineering approach. CSI provides core engineering, prototyping and project management capabilities, and complements these skills by leveraging the distributed capabilities of other RDECs, depots, arsenals, government agencies and industry. Capabilities: CSI employs best engineering practices to develop and integrate solutions at the component, subsystem and integrated vehicle system levels. It applies these same approaches successfully to diverse products such as bridges and capability insertion into Army watercraft. Core capabilities include mechanical and electrical engineering, reverse engineering, electronics, circuit boards, wiring harnesses and embedded software. Solutions are documented and transitioned through technical data packages (TDPs), including production-ready engineering drawings, bills of materials and user manuals. Tools include Creo computer-aided design (CAD) modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), human factors and failure analysis. CSI houses TARDEC&amp;#39;s Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) where engineering solutions are realized in physical form for evaluation and delivery to customers. Capabilities include an extensive machining and welding area with laser and water jet cutting machines, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, ballistic-certified welding and Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) painting. The PIF has more than 22,000 square feet of assembly area, including 15 fully customizable assembly bays and multiple overhead rail cranes that allow the physical integration of engineered systems and subsystems onto many ground platforms. CSI combines its engineering and prototype integration capabilities, as well as those of its contributing partners, through a detailed project management process. It enables management of the entire project&amp;#39;s cost, schedule, performance and risk, from project requirements definition through system development, to TDP delivery. Benefits: CSI&amp;#39;s ability to do internal government engineering, prototyping and integration results in several benefits: &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Ability to start a project within days of identifying a need. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Flexibility to adapt to evolving project requirements. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Flexibility in production and sustainment through delivery of a government-owned TDP. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Early production options through partnerships with depots and arsenals. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Capability to fabricate small quantities to meet urgent timelines.
