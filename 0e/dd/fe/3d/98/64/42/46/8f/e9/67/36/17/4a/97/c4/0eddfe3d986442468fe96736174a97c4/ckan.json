  "notes": "The Illinois River National Wildlife and Fish Refuges Complex stretches along 124 miles of the Illinois River in west central Illinois. The Complex includes three refuges: Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Emiquon NWR, and Meredosia NWR. The three refuges, which together total nearly 13,000 acres, are a mix of backwater lakes, bottomland forests, floodplain wetlands and a small amount of upland forest and prairie. The Illinois River Refuge Complex originated in 1936 with the establishment of Chautauqua NWR for the main purpose of providing sanctuary for the millions of birds that migrate along the Illinois River. As the Refuge Complex grew with the addition of Meredosia NWR in 1973 and Emiquon NWR in 1993, the purpose expanded to include the conservation of wetlands, natural resources, as well as endangered or threatened species. Today, the refuge complex plays an important role in conservation of the Illinois River corridor and is one of the only sanctuary areas for waterfowl along the river during hunting season. The refuge’s priority resources of concern (ROC) were identified by using a structured selection process, including a review of species of concern identified in international, national, regional and local conservation plans and analyzing their relation to the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health (BIDEH) of the refuge habitats. Through this selection process, the refuge identified 15 priority species for which the refuge will actively manage habitat and monitor. Priority species were selected to serve as indicators and representatives for other important species and groups that may utilize similar habitat. As part of our ROC selection, we also evaluated and identified a diversity of habitat types for future management that support priority ROC or provide rare natural communities. Seasonal wetland, bottomland forest, and upland forest habitat types were selected by the planning team as priorities for habitat management. The ROC selection and prioritization process is discussed in detail within chapter 3. The HMP builds upon the goals, objectives, and strategies identified in the Illinois River Refuge Complex Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) completed in 2004. As part of our HMP planning process, the planning team determined that it was necessary to combine numerous objectives under the Habitat and Wildlife Goals and add specificity as outlined by the Service’s Writing Goals and Objectives Handbook (Adamcik et al. 2004). These updated objectives and their relation to the 2004 CCP goals and objectives are discussed further in Chapter 4. The HMP also prioritizes strategies and specific units for focusing management. This identification of strategies and their prioritization was the result of the planning team’s close evaluation of priority resource needs and associated management objectives. In doing so, we considered the logistical and biological needs for resources across all refuges, divisions, and their management units. We also outlined which strategies are capable of being completed by existing refuge resources and contrasted those with others requiring additional resource inputs in order to achieve the refuge’s biological goals and objectives over the next 15 years.",
