  "notes": " The Energetics Manufacturing Technology Center (EMTC), established in 1994 by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program, is Navy operated and located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) , Indian Head, MD. A renowned leader in energetics, NSWC IHEODTD serves as the focal point for this group and provides a full spectrum of capabilities including energetics research, development, modeling and simulation, engineering, manufacturing technology, production, test and evaluation, and fleet/operations support. The Center does not own or operate any facilities and equipment, but is essentially a virtual enterprise that involves government, industry, and academia in identifying requirements and executing projects. Our objectives are to identify weapon system and manufacturing base needs, develop and demonstrate the required manufacturing process technology solutions, and finally transition successful results. The EMTC is responsible for:  Providing advice to the ONR ManTech Program Director concerning program formulation. Funding projects to develop and demonstrate manufacturing technology solutions for identified Navy manufacturing issues. Facilitating the transition and implementation of successful project results. Providing consulting services to Navy program offices and industrial activities, other services and the DoD, other government departments and agencies, academia, and industry. The EMTC is one of nine Centers of Excellence established by the ONR ManTech Program to identify and execute projects. Navy ManTech concentrates on developing, demonstrating, transitioning and implementing new or improved manufacturing processes for the production of weapon systems, subsystems and/or their components. The goal of the program is to use demonstrated manufacturing science and technology from research and development (R&amp;amp;D) work in order to develop and implement manufacturing processes that produce affordable (lower costs), quality (increase reliability) products. In other words, Navy ManTech provides a bridge from demonstrated R&amp;amp;D to implementation of new or improved manufacturing technology into the production arena.  ",
