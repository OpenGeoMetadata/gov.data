  "notes": "A one 1000 ml (one Liter) water sample was collected daily (at approximately 1000 hrs EST - but see note below in section 1.2.3 Supplemental Information) at a depth of 0.5 meter below the water's surface at three sites in the North Inlet salt marsh tidal creeks: Town Creek, Clambank, and Crab Haul (at the end of the Oyster Landing dock). The water samples were analyzed for chlorophyll a, phaeophytin, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, nitrate-nitrite), phosphorus (total and dissolved and ortho phosphate), organic carbon [total (TOC), dissolved (DOC), particulate (POC)], suspended sediment [Total Suspended Sediment (TSS), Inorganic Suspended Sediment (ISS), Organic Suspended Sediment (OSS)], and suspended sediment color. Tide level or water level (see note below in Supplemental Information), water temperature, secchi depth were noted in the field at the time of the water collection; salinity was measured when the sample was brought into the laboratory for processing. From 1977 to 1986, ATP analyzes were also run on the samples but are not part of this database. From 1985 to 1988 water chemistry analysis (listed above) were run on water samples from Debidue Creek, but are not included as part of this database. Using the Munsell Soil Chart, sediment color was determined for each suspended sediment filter starting in June 1988; this database is an ancillary database and is available for use.",
