  "notes": "White-tailed deer have been present on Plum Island since before Refuge establishment in 1942. An aerial survey in 1948 revealed at least 15 deer wintering on the island portion of the refuge. Deer numbers increased and peaked at an estimated 38 animals in the mid 1950's. At that time, the refuge biologist stated \"the herd is approaching the critical state of the carrying capacity\" for the refuge. During January and February, 1956, refuge  personnel noted that, \"extensive damage to the limited browse is now evident.\" Deer were browsing twigs of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) up to 3/8\" in diameter and were damaging the two-year-old Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) plantation. In 1957, an archery hunt for deer was initiated and continued for five years. Thirty-five deer were removed during this five year period. For the next 16 years; the number of deer on the refuge appeared to remain  somewhat stable, at about 12 animals. Deer numbers began to increase rapidly in the mid 70's. By 1982 \"numerous\" deer were being seen at all times of the year on the refuge, especially in late summer, feeding in the mowed fields.  In 1983, an effort was initiated to monitor the trend and nutritional status of Plum Island deer. It has been estimated that the refuge habitat can support in the range of 15-35 animals during the critical winter months when deer are under the greatest environmental stress and green browse such as grasses and forbes are not available. The Master Plan for Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, April 1986, page 44, identifies 16 acres of optimum quality, 806 acres of acceptable quality, and 1,237 acres of  minimum quality deer habitat on the refuge. From this data it was calculated that 15-20 (with a peak of 35) healthy deer could be maintained on the refuge without causing damage to the habitat - habitat which supports many other species of wildlife as well as deer. The December 1986 Environmental Assessment - Public Deer Hunt has been reviewed and updated and is presented for additional public review and comment. The basic changes are the inclusion of more current research information and updating of the existing program. Wording and text have also been adjusted in an effort to clarify meaning and context.",
