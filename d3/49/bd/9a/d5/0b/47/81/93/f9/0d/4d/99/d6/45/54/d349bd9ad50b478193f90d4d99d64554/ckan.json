    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The reprocessed OMI/Aura Level-2 Zoomed Ozone data product OMDOAO3Z at 13x12 km resolution is now available (http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omdoao3z_v003.shtml ) from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) for the public access. It is the second release of Version 003 and was reprocessed late 2011.\n\nOMI provides two sets of total column ozone products OMTO3 and OMDOAO3 which are based on two different algorithms.  OMTO3 product is based on TOMS like ozone retrieval algorithm whereas OMDOAO3 total column ozone product  is based on the Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) fitting technique that essentially uses the OMI visible radiance values between 331.1 and 336.1 nm.  The DOAS retrieval algorithm is developed by the KNMI OMI Scientist, Dr  Pepijn Veefkind. Based on spatial reolutions, there are two DOAS algorithm based ozone products, OMDOAO3 (at 13x24 km resolution) and OMDOAO3Z (13x12 km resolution) . In addition to the total ozone column values these DOAS based ozone products also contain some auxiliary derived and ancillary input parameters e.g. ozone slant column density, ozone ghost column density, air mass factor, scene reflectivity, radiance over the DOAS fit window, root mean square of DAOS fit, cloud fraction, cloud radiance, cloud pressure, terrain height,  geolocation, viewing angles and quality flags.\n\n(The shortname for this Level-2 OMI Zoomed Ozone product is OMDOAO3Z)\n\nOMDOAO3Z files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). OMDOAO3Z data files are based on Zoomed Level 1B radiance observations which are made once a month. Thus there is one day of zoomed data (approximately 14 orbits) per month. The maximum file size for the OMDOAO3Z data is about 30 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml\n    \nA Readme document containing brief algorithm description and known data quality related issues and  file spec are  provided by the OMDOAO3 Algorithm lead (see  documents available from OMI product site http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omdoao3z_v003.shtml The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) launched on NASA Aura satellite in July 2004, has been providing  daily global measurements of  clouds, atmospheric pollutants (Ozone, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulfur-dioxide, HCHO and Aerosols from biomass burning and industrial emissions) , BrO and OClO for tracking ozone depletion and surface UV irradiance. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) in collaboration with Finish Meteorological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal investigator's (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites:",
