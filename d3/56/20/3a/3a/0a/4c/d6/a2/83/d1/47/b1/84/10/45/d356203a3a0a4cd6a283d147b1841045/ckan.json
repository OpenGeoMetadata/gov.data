  "notes": "The State of Connecticut Stream Flow Standards and Regulations (Section 26-141b-1 to 26-141b-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies) require that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in consultation with the Department of Public Health prepare a State-wide map of proposed classifications indicative of the degree of human alteration of natural stream flow. State-wide classifications will be completed over a five year period. The current map reflects preliminary stream flow classifications available for public comment in the first three major basins in CT to be classified, including the Thames, Pawcatuck and Southeast Coastal major basin. The layer includes line features that depict the stream flow classifications for the rivers and streams in Connecticut at a 1:24,000 scale.The regulations define four stream flow class standards. Class 1 is described as a free flowing stream. Class 2 is described as a minimally altered stream flow conditions. Class 3 is described as moderately altered and Class 4 is described as substantially altered stream flow. The regulations include consideration of 18 factors related to the degree of alteration in streamflow when adopting river or stream system classifications.  Spatial data for each of the factors was gathered from a variety of best available sources.  These sources were available at varying scales.  A methodology was developed to consider all 18 factors and determine the class for a particular stream segment. For more detail, see Section 26-141b-5 RCSA Adoption of river or stream system classifications, Fact Sheet for Stream Flow Classication Process under Section 26-141b-1 to 26-141b-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, and Technical Support Document, Methodology for Defining Preliminary Stream Flow Classification .These documents can be found on the CT DEEP website at www.ct.gov/deep/streamflow .",
