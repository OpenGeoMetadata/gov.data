  "notes": "This medium-scale (generally 1:100,000) data set represents municipal boundaries in Minnesota, including changes filed with and approved by the Minnesota Department of Administration's Municipal Boundary Adjustments group through May 31, 2003. The over 3,000 municipalities (minor civil divisions or MCDs) in Minnesota include cities, townships and unorganized territories. Municipal Boundary Adjustments staff work with property owners, local governments, and state agencies to review and facilitate 375 to 400 municipal boundary adjustments annually. The majority of petitions for adjustment are from property owners and the remainder are from cities and townships. The U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000 Municipal Boundary File (TIGER) for Minnesota served as the foundation for this work. The data was first adjusted by the Minnesota Legislative Coordinating Commission (LCC) GIS Office (see Lineage Section of this metadata record for more information on the original file) and subsequently by LMIC in 2002, at the request of the Office of the Secretary of State. Most recently, boundary changes filed with and approved by the Minnesota Boundary Adjustments group since February 2002 were incorporated in this file.",
