    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Energid Technologies proposes the development of a digital simulation to replace robotic vehicles in field studies.  It will model the dynamics, terrain interaction, sensors, control, communications, and interfaces of a robotic vehicle with the goal of supporting validation and training.  The simulation will be very easy to use by simple execution on a networked PC.  It will connect to NASA's robot-control frameworks and be easy to configure using a drag-and-drop interface.  It will be thorough in its ability to model a range of environments, from terrestrial to lunar, and through its ability to provide accurate sensor and truth data for analysis.  It will include simulation of communication latency and bandwidth restrictions.  Sensors will be modeled through a powerful plugin interface that supports tying stimulation of new sensor modalities to terrain and objects.  The effort will include the development of robot, sensor, and environment models tailored to the simulation of field-study vehicles, and it will emphasize mimicking the network interfaces used by NASA.  The proxy simulation will be able to model multiple and disparate robots simultaneously.  Energid will implement and deliver a complete, executable system and an underlying C++ software toolkit.",
