  "notes": "Polygon versions of the terrestrial CZB with a generalized shoreline (USGS 1:24,000 Quadrangle shoreline heads up digitized at 1:3000) and with a more detailed shoreline that includes most bays and estuaries. It was digitized within AutoCAD from the Commission's certified Coastal Zone Boundary hard copy maps. The files were then imported into ArcView, and merged together following Commission jurisdictional boundaries (North Coast, North Central Coast, Central Coast, South Central Coast, South Coast, and San Diego). The line work was originally georeferenced to the USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) in Teale Albers projection. The data was later refined to the DRGs in UTM, Zones 10 and 11, NAD 83 meters. This file is intended to be displayed upon the UTM DRGs as a base map. In addition, the data was later attributed to help explain the basis of the mapped Coastal Zone.",
