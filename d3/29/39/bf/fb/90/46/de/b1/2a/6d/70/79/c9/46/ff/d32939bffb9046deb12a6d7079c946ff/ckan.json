  "notes": "This data set consists of digital water-level elevation contours for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River in northwestern Oklahoma during 1985-86. Ground water in 1,305 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are composed of interfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and cross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The aquifer is composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits that unconformably overlie the Permian-age Formations. Water-level elevations measured in 1985 and 1986 ranged from 1,650 feet to 950 feet above sea level. Regional ground-water flow is generally southeast to southwest towards the Cimarron River, except where the flow direction is affected by perennial tributaries. The water-level elevation contours were digitized from a mylar map at a scale of 1:250,000. The maps were published at a scale of 1:900,000.",
