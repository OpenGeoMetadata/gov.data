  "notes": "The IFEL was designed for metallurgical and metallographic studies of irradiated fuels for power and test reactors. The IFEL is also capable of post-irradiation examination (PIE) of test loops and other reactor components. Other programs conducted at the IFEL in the past include the examination of sealed radiation sources of Cs-137 (50,000 Ci); Ir-192 isotope processing, packaging, and shipping; and spent nuclear fuel remediation and packaging. The IFEL has a large hot cell structure consisting of 3 separate cells (in the shape of a &ldquo;U&rdquo;), consisting of 13 workstations and 15 viewing windows, each with a pair of master-slave manipulators. The inside surfaces of the cells lined with stainless steel to aid decontamination and the gas tight cells are alpha type. There are also electromechanical manipulators and a 3-ton crane for moving heavy objects inside the cells. The facility also contains a Core Conduction Cool-down Test Facility to test radioactive samples under controlled thermal conditions while monitoring the samples to determine the release rate of volatile radioactive materials. An irradiated microsphere gamma analyzer to determine the types and amount of fission products in irradiated coated-particle fuel is also located in the facility. A scanning electron microscope (SEM)/microprobe sample preparation cell is available to prepare small amounts of irradiated fuel or alpha-contaminated or irradiated materials for SEM/microprobe examination. The is also a large decontamination cell on the second floor. There is also a hot equipment storage area available.  ",
