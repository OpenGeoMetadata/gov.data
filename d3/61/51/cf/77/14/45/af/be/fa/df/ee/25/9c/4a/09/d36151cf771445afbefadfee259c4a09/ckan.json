    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed R&amp;D is to develop a wireless data networking capability.  A prototype capability will result from the Phase 1 and 2 contracts.  The Versatile Wireless Data Net (VWDN) employs an 802.11x wireless protocol for a network of sensor, recording, and monitoring nodes.   The concept combines extensive computational capability with a family of transducers in self-contained packages with an electrical and environmental immunity.  Plug-in transducers include microphones, extensometers, toxic gas, pressure sensors, explosive gas, strain gauges (both resistance and fiber-optical), load cells, electromagnetic flux, pyrometers, and accelerometers; many will be MEMS devices.  The net enables coordinated, efficient transmission of measurement signals; self test metrics, and environmental metrics to a recording computer.  This computer also performs data display and network control for operator intervention to set network functional priorities and implement appropriate responses to monitoring trouble messages.  An existing ABT wireless nodal prototype and workstation computer will be used as the basis for the developing the full network capability, that will primarily use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) MEMS transducers.  After the concept is sufficiently defined, Phase 1 tasks will include a simulation to demonstrate proof of concept.  \r\n ",
