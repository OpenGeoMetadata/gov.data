    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\"We propose to develop a novel ultra-compact spectrograph-on-a-chip for the submillimeter and millimeter waveband. SuperSpec uses planar lithographed superconducting transmission-line filters to sort incident radiation by frequency to an array of direct detectors such as MKIDs. The system is naturally wideband and can be very low loss, enabling background-limited spectroscopy on the ground and in space, as is currently done with a diffraction grating spectrographs. But while moderate-resolution grating systems for the mm and submm bands have sizes measured in tens of centimeters, SuperSpec can have a size measured in millimeters. If successful, SuperSpec will pave the way for a new kind of astronomical instrument for the submm/mm: a 2-D array of hundreds to thousands of individual spectrometers, each simultaneously measuring a separate spectrum. With the possible exception of polarization, such an instrument extracts all available information from the light at a telescope focal plane.\n\n\n\nSuperSpec thus offers the potential to revolutionize astrophysics in the far-IR through millimeter, an important spectral regime for which the the Astro2010 Decadal Survey made two specific recommendations for this decade: 1) Participate in the Japanese-led SPICA space telescope with a spectrometer instrument such as BLISS, and 2) Construct CCAT and its associated instrumentation. Depending on SPICA's schedule, SuperSpec technology could be injected and would enhance and extend the long-wavelength capability of BLISS or a similar instrument. Whether or not SPICA moves ahead quickly, our demonstration will position SuperSpec to be used in on CCAT and suborbital platforms this decade, paving the way for optimal science return with future NASA-led cryogenic far-IR space missions on the drawing board for the next decade: CALISTO/SAFIR and SPIRIT.\n\n\n\nSuperSpec is based on propagation on a superconducting transmission line (TL). As radiation propagates along the line, it encounters a seri",
