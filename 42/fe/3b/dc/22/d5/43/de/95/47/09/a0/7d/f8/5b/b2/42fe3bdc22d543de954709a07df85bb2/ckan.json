    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The challenges of designing, developing, and fielding man-rated propulsion systems continue to increase as NASA's Vision for Space Exploration Program moves beyond the Space Shuttle and RSRM.  The number and type of different propulsion elements required are significant, and predicting internal solid motor behavior and characteristics and assessing external environments (e.g., plume impingement on vehicle structures and launch acoustic loading) is a priority.  Our proposed innovation will enhance existing engineering software by combining new physical modeling capabilities with appropriate boundary conditions to create a novel toolset for complex multi-phase solid rocket analyses.  The innovation will be based on the Loci/Chem multi-physics analysis package and will utilize new Loci features, new multi-phase flow models, theoretical and phenomenological boundary conditions, and modified real gas equations of state to create a unique software tool for particle breakup, surface heat transfer with particle deposition, launch environment characterization, and nozzle erosion for next generation solid motors.  Our research products will provide NASA with the important capability to simultaneously analyze solid propellant combustion, heat transfer, launch acoustics, and nozzle erosion within a single unified numerical framework.  We will validate the approach using appropriate two phase flow problems to achieve a TRL range of 3-4.",
