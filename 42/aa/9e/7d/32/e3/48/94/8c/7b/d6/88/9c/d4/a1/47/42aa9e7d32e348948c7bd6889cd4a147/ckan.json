    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA has initiated a program to explore the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS) using the Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), which has a payload of over 1500 lb (680 kg), max ceiling of 65,000 ft (20 km) at a cruising speed of 335 kts and mission endurance of over 31 hours.  These attributes make the Global Hawk UAS especially valuable as a tool for investigating subvisible cirrus (SVC) clouds, which are commonly found in the Tropical Tropospheric Layer (TTL) and are considered to have a significant potential impact on global climate change.  \r\n\r\nThe first of a series of NASA field programs, the UAS Aura Validation Experiment (UAS-AVE), is scheduled to take place in 2009 with the Global Hawk investigating aerosols and gas phase chemistry in the UT/LS. In ensuing years it is anticipated that follow-on field projects will utilize the Global Hawk to investigate properties of SVC clouds. Currently, there is no instrument available for installation on the Global Hawk that is capable of measuring particle size distributions and capturing high-resolution images of cloud particles in SVC. These measurements are essential for understanding the radiative effects that SVC has on the earth energy balance. \r\n\r\nIn Phase I we propose to design and perform proof-of-concept laboratory tests of a state-of-the-art integrated instrument that measures cloud particle size distributions from 1 micron to about 3 mm, and provides three simultaneous digital images of cloud particles.  The new probe will combine three instruments that SPEC sells commercially into a compact, aerodynamic package that runs autonomously.  In addition, it will be totally compatible with the NASA Research Environment for Vehicle-Embedded Analysis on Linux (REVEAL) system, so that investigators on the ground can view data and control probe functions.  In Phase II we propose to build a working prototype and fly it on the Global Hawk (or a Learjet research aircraft if the Global Hawk is not available).",
