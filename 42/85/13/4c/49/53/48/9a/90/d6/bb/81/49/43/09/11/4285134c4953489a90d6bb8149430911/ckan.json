    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The development of a new generation of large, high power deployable solar arrays has been identified as the most significant challenge facing the development of solar electric propulsion (SEP) systems.  In response, innovative solar array structural concepts have been proposed including flexible thin-film solar arrays which roll like a carpet for stowage.  These systems are simple and reliable while also exhibiting high performance.  Rollable solar arrays have not yet reached a high enough technology readiness level (TRL) to be utilized as the primary solar array in a high-stakes mission.  The TRL of the current rollable solar array systems is hindered by their reliance on a particular manifestation of deployable slit-tubes which utilizes an open and unsupported slit and high-performance fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials.  The FRP slit tubes are high performance and ideally suited to the ROSA system, but do not have sufficient test-heritage or widely accepted engineering tools to enable reliable and efficient structural predictions such as buckling strength or design optimization studies.  A slit-tube optimization loop including comprehensive testing and analysis as well as the evaluation of novel design features and manufacturing methods is proposed to improve roll out solar array technologies being considered for SEP.  The proposed technology will result in a library of slit-tube test data with analytical correlation, will increase the deployed strength over the state of the art by 4X and increase the state of the art TRL.",
