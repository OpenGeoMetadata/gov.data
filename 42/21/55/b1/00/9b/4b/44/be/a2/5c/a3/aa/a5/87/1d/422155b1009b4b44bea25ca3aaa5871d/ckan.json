Sea otters were tracked by shore based observers from the date of tagging until the time of radio battery failure or the animalâs death, whichever comes first. The frequency of re-sighting was opportunistic, depending on logistical factors such as coastal access, but generally ranged from daily to weekly. Location coordinates are reported as X and Y coordinates in the projection/datum California Teale-Albers NAD 1927. Each file contains resight data for one individual sea otter collected over a period of 1-10 years. Fields include individual identification number, geographic coordinates, the date and time of the sighting location, and associated behavioral state of the individual at the time of re-sighting.",
