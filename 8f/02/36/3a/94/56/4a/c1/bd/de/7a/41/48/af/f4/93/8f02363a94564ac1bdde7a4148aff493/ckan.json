  "notes": " FUNCTION: Conducts full&amp;#226;&#128;&#145;scale fire/damage control experiments in a shipboard environment. This test platform can provide an integrated picture of the interactions of man, equipment, materials, tactics, doctrine, and systems in the development of fire protection/damage control concepts and technology, including the use of chemical simulants. DESCRIPTION: Ex-USSShadwell (LSD 15) has an overalllength of 457 ft, beam of 72 ft, and full load displacement of 9000 tons. As a testbed, the ship contains one pressure zone to study smoke management, including a collective protection system (CPS) that has been created on all levels forward of frame 35. Selected ship systems that are important to fire protection and damage control, such as ventilation, electrical power, fluid distribution, fire mains, fire pumps, aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) proportioning system, and internal communications, have been reactivated. The ship has undergone major automation upgrades to its damage control systems. There is a high-pressure fine water mist systemover all decks forward of frame 35. Simulated on the ship are an aircraft carrier hangar bay, the forward section of a SNN 688 submarine, one complete CPS of DDG 51 and its simulated machinery space, LPD 17 well deck with ventilation, DDX flight deck and hangar along with Peripheral Vertical Launch Systems (PVLS) and Automatic Gun System (AGS) magazines, and LHA(R) upper and lower vehicle storage area and well deck. INSTRUMENTATION: The facility has extensive sensor and analytical sampling and analysis capabilities for measuring temperature, pressure, smoke obscuration, fluid flow, radiation flux, and total heat flux. There are video recorders for documentation of the fire tests and significant computing facilities for data collection, manipulation, and presentation. There is a 1-gigabit blown fiber network, which is tied into the data system, with 12-node rooms for input, output, and control of ship sensors and functions. This provides video coverage throughout the ship.  ",
