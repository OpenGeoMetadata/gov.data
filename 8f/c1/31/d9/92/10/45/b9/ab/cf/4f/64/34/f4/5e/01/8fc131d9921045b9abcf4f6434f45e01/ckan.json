  "notes": " FUNCTION: Enables scientists to measure the infrared (IR) signature of scale aircraft or ship models in a controlled environment, to test the effectiveness of new signature suppression coatings, and to validate IR signature codes against range imagery. Simulates the IR environment from sea level to 30,000-ft altitudes, and provides viewing angles representative of standard IR threats, versatile control of scale model temperatures and orientations, and a low-cost alternative to IR field testing. DESCRIPTION: The NRL Infrared Range Facility is a unique national user facility that serves the IR signature community. The range is a 14-ft-diameter, temperaturecontrolled, cylindrical enclosure that is treated withhigh-emittance coatings on the inner walls. The enclosure is surrounded by a 20-ft-diameter thermal chamber. Test articles are inserted through the roof of the chamber and can be viewed over a range of elevation angles from -20&amp;#176; to +45&amp;#176;. The test article itself can be rotated through &amp;#177;180&amp;#176;, tilted through &amp;#177;45&amp;#176;, and temperaturecontrolled through a variety of heaters and temperatureconditioned fluids. A midwave infrared (MWIR) source is available for semiquantitative solar simulations. The dry air atmosphere within the chamber has a dewpoint of approximately -70 &amp;#176;C and a CO  2  level of below 1 ppm. Low CO  2  levels are needed to minimize absorption in the CO2 absorption doublet near 4.2  &amp;#956;m.  The low dewpoints are needed to minimize frost formation on the chamber walls when configured for high-altitude conditions (long-wavelength infrared, LWIR). The chamber walls used to simulate the zenith sky can attain temperatures as low as -110 &amp;#176;C. The sky panels are coated with a new type of flocked black coating with a hemispherical reflectance below 0.2% throughout the IR. Without such a coating, the thermal radiation from the warm Earth panels would reflect from the sky panels and overwhelm the emitted radiation from the sky. INSTRUMENTATION: State-of-the-art focal plane array cameras, low-temperature blackbodies, hemispherical directional reflectometers, and laser-based scatterometers for measuring the bidirectional distribution function.
