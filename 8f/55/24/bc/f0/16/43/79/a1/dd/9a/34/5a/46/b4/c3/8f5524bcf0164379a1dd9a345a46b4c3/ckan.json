    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "DYNAMIC STRAIN MAPPING AND REAL-TIME DAMAGE STATE\r\nESTIMATION UNDER BIAXIAL RANDOM FATIGUE LOADING\r\n\r\nSUBHASISH MOHANTY*, ADITI CHATTOPADHYAY*, JOHN N. RAJADAS**, AND CLYDE COELHO*\r\n\r\nAbstract. Fatigue damage and its prediction is one of the foremost concerns of structural integrity\r\nresearch community. The current research in structural health monitoring (SHM) is to\r\nprovide continuous (or on demand) information about the state of a structure. The SHM system\r\ncan be based on either active or passive sensor measurements. Though the current research on\r\nultrasonic wave propagation based active sensing approach has the potential to estimate very small\r\ndamage, it has severe drawbacks in terms of low sensing radius and external power requirements.\r\nTo alleviate these disadvantages passive sensing based SHM techniques can be used. Currently,\r\nfew efforts have been made towards, time-series fatigue damage state estimation over the entire\r\nfatigue life (stage-I, II & III). A majority of the available literature on passive sensing SHM techniques\r\ndemonstrates the clear trend in damage growth during the final failure regime (stage-III\r\nregime) or during when the damage is comparatively large enough. The present paper proposes a\r\npassive sensing technique that demonstrates a clear trend in damage growth almost over the entire\r\nstage-II and III damage growth regime. A strain gauge measurement based passive SHM frameworks\r\nthat can estimate the time-series fatigue damage state under random loading is proposed.\r\nFor this purpose, a Bayesian Gaussian process nonlinear dynamic model is developed to map the\r\nreference condition dynamic strain at a given instant of time. The predicted strains are compared\r\nwith the actual sensor measurements to estimate the corresponding error signals. The error signals\r\nestimated at two different locations are correlated to estimate the corresponding fatigue damage\r\nstate. The approach is demonstrated for an Al-2434 complex cruciform structure applied with\r\nbiaxial random loading.",
