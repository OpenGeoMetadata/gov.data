    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This program addresses the need for interfacial and in-depth temperature monitoring of thermal protection systems (TPS).  Novel, linear drive, eddy current methods are proposed that incorporate innovative sensor array constructs, physics-based models, and multivariate inverse methods to nondestructively assess temperatures for carbon-based TPS materials such as felts and PICA.  The sensors can be mounted behind the TPS material or embedded within the TPS with sensing fields that are projected through the material to the far surface interface.  Thermally induced changes in the electrical properties of the TPS material are then used to determine the temperatures.  In Phase I, the focus is on establishing feasibility by demonstrating correlations between electrical properties measured by the eddy current sensors and the TPS temperature.  It will also investigate adaptation of the sensor materials to support sustained and transient operation at high temperatures compared to typical operating conditions for standard eddy current sensors.  JENTEK's physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies have been demonstrated in scanning configurations for coating characterization, corrosion detection and sizing with and without interference layers, and condition and thickness assessment of felt-based TPS materials.  These methods have also been extended to surface mounted sensing applications such as torque, fatigue, and heat treatment condition monitoring.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle leading edge to detect damage of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus after establishing the property correlations with temperature, JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a novel method for temperature monitoring of TPS materials and material condition monitoring at elevated temperatures.",
