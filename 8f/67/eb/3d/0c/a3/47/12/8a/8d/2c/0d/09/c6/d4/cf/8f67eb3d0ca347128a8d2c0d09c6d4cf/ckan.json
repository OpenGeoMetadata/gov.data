    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed Phase II project includes the design, fabrication, and testing of a fully-functional 320 element X-band antenna which will serve dual-roles as both the proof-of-design (POD) and the proof-of-manufacturability (POM) prototype of ThinKom's innovative low-cost electronically scanned array (ESA) antenna technology.  Simultaneously emphasizing affordability and performance, this antenna subsystem will uniquely enable near-term wide deployment of airborne hazard detection and avoidance radar systems with greatly enhanced performance and functionality relative to currently fielded systems.  This technology comprises a proprietary integrated \"quasi-monolithic\" feed/phase-shifter/radiator topology exclusively realized using low-risk low-cost flight-proven, manufacturing materials, components, and processes.  In addition, this architecture is ideally-suited for simplified compact integration with a highly reliable, low-cost, low-power consumption beam steering controller (BSC) utilizing pre-existing COTS components.  The expected RF loss through the feed, phase shifter, and radiator of this low-cost/high-performance topology is less than 1 dB at X-Band, which is no greater than (and in most cases less than) that of \"traditional\" (much) higher cost ESA implementations.  Building upon the Phase I preliminary antenna subsystem design and highly successful phase-shifter risk-reduction verification testing accomplished in Phase I,  the Phase II program will directly demonstrate and prove both the performance and revolutionary cost reduction potential of this new \"no compromise\" ESA architecture and technology.   In addition to the targeted aviation hazard detection radar/sensor application, other benefiting applications would include ground mapping, atmospheric studies, and launch range surveillance radars and sensors as well as communication applications for which an agile highly directional beam is required such as high-gain LOS and NLOS (SATCOM) Data Links.",
