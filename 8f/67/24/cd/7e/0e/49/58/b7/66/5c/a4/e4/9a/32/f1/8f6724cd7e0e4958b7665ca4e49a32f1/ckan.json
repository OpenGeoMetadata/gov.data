    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set consists of Lansat thematic mapper imagergy collected over \nthe Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) Large Regional Study Area (LRSA), located between 104-108.5 W and \n38.5-42 N. Data were collected between 10 November 2001 and 9 January 2003,  using the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor (ETM+) on Landsat 7 and the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on Landsat 5. Data consist of Level 1G imagery \nproducts (radiance) that have been radiometrically and geometrically \ncorrected.   Each band of Landsat data in the GeoTIFF format is delivered \nas a greyscale, uncompressed, 8-bit string of unsigned integers. This data \nset is part of the NASA CLPX\n\nNASA CLPX is a multi-sensor, multi-scale \nexperiment that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water \nfluxes, storage, and transformations to regional and global scales. Within \na framework of nested study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the \nwestern United States, ranging from 1-ha to 160,000 km2, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations are collected. Data collection focuses \non two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions are generally frozen and dry, \nand early spring, a transitional period when both frozen and thawed, dry \nand wet conditions are widespread.",
