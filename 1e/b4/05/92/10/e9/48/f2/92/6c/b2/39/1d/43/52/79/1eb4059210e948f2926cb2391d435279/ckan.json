For more information see http://www.itis.gov/ws_description.html The ITIS JSON services provide an API that matches the Web Service API. All calls for JSON data are made by substituting \"jsonservice\" into the Web Service call in place of the \"services/ITISService\" part of the URL. Besides standard JSON output, you can also get JSON data from the web service in JSON-P format. This provides the JSON data wrapped in a JavaScript function for safer cross-domain Ajax calls.",

The database is reviewed periodically to ensure high quality with valid classifications, revisions, and additions of newly described species. The ITIS includes documented taxonomic information of flora and fauna from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For each scientific name, ITIS includes the authority, taxonomic rank, a unique taxonomic serial number, data source information, data quality indicators, and associated synonyms and vernacular names where available. Geographic coverage is worldwide, with an emphasis on North American taxa. The ITIS Web Services provide the ability to search and retrieve data from ITIS by providing access to the data behind the ITIS web site (http://www.itis.gov/web_service.html#).
