  "notes": " The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) is designed to advance medical research on rare diseases by providing support for clinical studies and facilitating collaboration, study enrollment and data sharing. Through the network, scientists from multiple disciplines at hundreds of clinical sites around the world work together with patient advocacy groups to study more than 200 rare diseases. The purpose of the RDCRN is to facilitate clinical research in rare diseases through support for:  Collaborative activities, including multisite longitudinal studies of individuals with rare diseases, and/or clinical trials Training of clinical investigators in rare diseases research Pilot and demonstration projects Uniform data collection protocols Access to information about rare diseases for basic and clinical researchers, academic and practicing physicians, patients, and the public The RDCRN was established by the NIH Office of Rare Diseases in 2003 and now is overseen by NCATS. Since its launch, nearly 29,000 patients have been enrolled in network clinical studies. As of October 2014, the network is composed of about 2,600 researchers, including scientific program staff from NCATS and collaborating NIH components, academic investigators, and members of 98 patient advocacy groups; 91 studies are under way.
