  "notes": "In 1992 multiple investigations were performed to collect preliminary information to direct future studies aimed at characterizing contaminant problems in the Clinch River Basin. Each investigator in the study used a different approach to assess potential contaminant impacts and develop a variety of information. Chemical residue analysis was performed to determine the concentration of metals in grab and trap sediment samples collected at 10 sites in the Basin. Results showed that metals concentrations were not elevated above biological criteria at any of the sites. Pore-water from the sediment samples was analyzed for general toxicity screening using the MicrotoxR toxicity test. Relatively low levels of toxicity were measured for most samples, except for one downriver site on the Clinch River and one site at the mouth of Copper Creek. A cellulolytic enzyme assay with Corbicula fluminea was used to assess physiological responses to metals in sediments at the same 10 sites. Results contrasting each site showed a response similar to the MicrotoxR test, indicating that the Clinch River site and Copper Creek site mentioned above had stress factors that also reduced Corbicula enzyme activity. Community structure of fish was considered using the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to analyze data collected at 42 sites in the Clinch Basin, Depressed IBI scores were not associated clearly with particular regions of the Clinch Basin (i.e., upper or lower) or predominant land uses (i.e., mining, agriculture). No Clinch River site scored below the \"Good\" range, but numerous tributaries were rated \"Fair\" or \"Poor.\" The only concentrations of \"Fair\" or \"Poor\" sites were in Big Cedar Creek and in the Guest River, respectively. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure was quantified using the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) to analyze data collected at 13 sites in the Clinch Basin. The ICI results indicated most sites scored in the \"Fair\" or \"Good\" ranges, with two sites in the \"Excellent\" range and one in the \"Poor\" range. The only land use that was significantly (p <0.05) correlated with ICI data was an inverse relationship between taxa richness and percent coal mining. Future studies recommended to address sources of ecological stress in the Basin include land use characterization, biotic surveys, and surface water and sediment sampling. Toxicity testing may also be used to further delineate contaminant-specific impacts to biota.",
