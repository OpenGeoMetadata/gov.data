  "notes": "We evaluated movements and home ranges of white-tailed deer (WT) and mule deer (MD) on and adjacent to Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in north-central Nebraska 2007-2009 relative to the potential risk of chronic wasting disease (CWD) transmission to refuge cervid populations, including elk confined by big game fence. A total of 26 WT and 7 MD were captured on the refuge; 13 adult female deer (9 WT; 4 MD) were fitted with GPS radio collars and the remaining deer were marked with numbered ear tags. Electronic records from 10 collared deer were used to estimate 95% home ranges and 50% core areas using the fixed kernel method and to evaluate daily movements. We used recovery information from ear-tagged bucks to document long distance movements by males. Home range analyses suggest eight deer (5 WT, 3 MD) had overlapping summer and winter home ranges, one WT was a seasonal migrant, and one MDâ€™s migration status was not determined. The average annual home range size for resident female WT on Fort Niobrara was 6.23 square miles which was more than 9 times larger than reported for DeSoto NWR in eastern Nebraska and approximately 30% smaller than for Crescent Lake NWR in western Nebraska. The average annual home range size for resident female MD on Fort Niobrara was 5.28 square miles, smaller than reported at Crescent Lake NWR. Average daily movement distance for female deer on Fort Niobrara (.30 miles, WT and MD) was greater than reported for female deer in eastern Nebraska (WT only) but similar to western Nebraska results (WT and MD). Core areas for both resident MD and WT on Fort Niobrara averaged 1.22 square miles and all but one deer had core area overlap with other collared deer. All deer had home ranges that included potential deer concentration areas off refuge and six deer had short-term movements outside of established home ranges. Collared deer moved freely through various fence types with the exception of big game fence, across which deer movements were greatly reduced. Although most of the female deer in this study had home ranges extending only 1-3 miles off the refuge, recovery information for ear-tagged bucks suggest some males make longer distance movements with 25-40 mile distances documented. The risk of CWD transmission to refuge cervid populations is present; however, refuge management practices should minimize this risk until all elk are managed as a free-ranging population at Fort Niobrara NWR.",
