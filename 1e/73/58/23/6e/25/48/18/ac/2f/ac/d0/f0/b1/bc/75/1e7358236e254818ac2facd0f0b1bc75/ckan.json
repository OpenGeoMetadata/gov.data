    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Ticosonde/Aura-TCSP 2005 radiosonde data set consists of 4 soundings per day (00, 06, 12 and 18 UT) launched from Juan Santamaria International Airport, WMO station 78762, latitude 10 degrees N and 84.2 degrees W.  The launch program began at 00 UT on 16 June 2005 and ended 00 UT 24 August 2005. With a very few exceptions, the sondes were Vaiasala model RS92-SGP and the ground station was a DigiCORA MW11 equipped for GPS wind-finding and upgraded for RS92 telemetry. A small number of ascents were made with RS90-AG and RS80-15G sondes.  Most ascents were done with 500-g latex balloons filled with hydrogen. Exceptions included 24 ascents at 06 and 18UT in July that were piggybacked on a larger payload consisting of the University of Colorado cryogenic frostpoint hygrometer (CFH) and an ECC ozonesonde. Median termination altitude for all ascents was approximately 26 km.  Data were recorded at the maximum MW11 sample rate of one every two seconds.",
