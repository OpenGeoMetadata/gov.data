    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains two files (comma-separated-value format). One file provides components of net primary productivity, standing biomass, age and stand structure, and litterfall data for 11 stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the Tomsk Region of Russia (approx. 58 N 83 E). The second file contains data for the same types of variables for three stands of Scots pine in the Irkutsk Region of Siberia (approx. 53 N 103 E). Field measurements were made in 0.3-0.4 ha forest plots between 1968 and 1974. The forest plots range in age from 25 to 122 years old. Tree biomass was determined from volume and density measurements and selective harvest. Understory and ground cover was harvested in 0.25m2 plots. Root mass has determined from harvested trees and soil monoliths. Wood increment was measured from annual rings. Root production was based on species-specific turnover rates. Leaf litterfall was measured in 0.5-1.0 m2 traps, and branch litterfall was estimated from 4.0 m2 plots. Revision Notes: The NPP data file has been split into two files, one for the Tomask forests and one for the Irkutsk forests. The data files have been revised to rearrange columns, add a total ANPP column, and correct previously reported data, where needed. Please see the Data Set Revisions section of this document for detailed information. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) data collection contains field measurements of biomass, estimated NPP, and climate data for terrestrial grassland, tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, and tundra sites worldwide. Data were compiled from the published literature for intensively studied and well-documented individual field sites and from a number of previously compiled multi-site, multi-biome data sets of georeferenced NPP estimates. The principal compilation effort (Olson et al., 2001) was sponsored by the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program. For more information, please visit the NPP web site at http://daac.ornl.gov/NPP/npp_home.html.",
