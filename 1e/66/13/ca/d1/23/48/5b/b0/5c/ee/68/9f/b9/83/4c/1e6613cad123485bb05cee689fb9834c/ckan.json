  "notes": "This GeoTiff is a bathymetry model of the seafloor of Northeast Puerto Rico that contains the shallow water area (0-35m deep) of the Northeast Ecological Reserve: including the waters off of Fajardo and Luqillo, to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound, La Cordillera Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island. The bathymetry model was created by integrating soundings from several different sources (1900-2013), including high resolution coastal LiDAR, NOAA Single-beam and multibeam bathymetry, and historical lead line soundings. In order to combine the many different data sources and densities, the model consists of three different resolutions (4m, 20m and 100m). In addition to the depth model, a depth uncertainty layer was also produced. The bathymetry model is the basis for the benthic habitat map which was produced by remote sensing analysis tools that delineated the habitats using a semi-automated classification process.",
