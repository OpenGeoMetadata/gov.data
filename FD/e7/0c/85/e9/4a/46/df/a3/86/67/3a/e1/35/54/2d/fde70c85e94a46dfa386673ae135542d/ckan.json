    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "After reviewing key background concepts in fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing, we will focus on the use of local fuzzy models, which are related to both kernel regressions and locally weighted learning. Instead of using a manual approach to develop such models, we use evolutionary algorithms to search in the design space of these models.\r\n\r\nWith these models we will determine the remaining life of a unit in a fleet of vehicles. Instead of developing individual models (based on the track history of each unit) or developing a global model (based on the collective track history of the fleet), we propose local fuzzy models based on clusters of peers, similar units with comparable utilization and performance. For each cluster of peers we create a local fuzzy model. We combine the fuzzy peer-based approach for performance modeling with an evolutionary framework for model maintenance. Our process generates a collection of competing models, evaluates their performance in light of the currently available data, refines the best models using evolutionary search, and selects the best one after a finite number of iterations. This process is repeated periodically to automatically produce updated and improved versions of the model.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this methodology we chose an asset selection problem: given a fleet of industrial vehicles (diesel electric locomotives), we want to select the best subset (of fixed or variable size) for mission-critical utilization. To this end, we predict the remaining life for each unit in the fleet. We then sort the fleet using this prediction and select the highest ranked units. The model chosen to perform this prediction/selection task is a fuzzy instance based model. A series of experiments using data from locomotive operations were conducted and the results from an initial validation exercise are presented.\r\n\r\nThe approach of constructing local predictive models using fuzzy similarity with neighboring points along appropriate dimensions is not specific to any asset type, but it applies to many other Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) problems.
