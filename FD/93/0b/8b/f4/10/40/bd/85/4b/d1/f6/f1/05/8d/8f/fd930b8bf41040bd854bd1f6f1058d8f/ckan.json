    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Broadband Photonics Inc. proposes development of a patent-pending distributed fiber optic sensor for in-space hydrogen leak detection. Reliable and fast detection of hydrogen leaks is critical to both operational safety and maintenance of propellant quantities for in-space hydrogen systems. Characteristics of the plume formed by a hydrogen leak are unpredictable in low gravity due to lack of buoyancy effects. The proposed hydrogen fiber sensor can detect any flow direction of a hydrogen leak, determine the leak location, and measure hydrogen concentration. The fiber sensor can also detect hydrogen leaks from unexpected locations in space vehicles caused by stress-induced tiny cracks or other various damages. The proposed sensor will have the same fast response speed and high sensitivity in cryogenic environments as in room temperature. Furthermore, the proposed fiber sensor offers several significant advantages, including reconfigurable, lightweight, one feed-through, easy installation, easy maintenance, and capability of working in radiation harsh environments. In Phase 1, feasibility work has been performed. In Phase 2, prototypes of the proposed hydrogen fiber sensor will be produced for field trial and be prepared for commercialization in Phase 3.",
