    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The dry-electrode harness is composed of a variety of components.&amp;nbsp; The harness interfaces with the human via a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) FDA cleared dry electrode that has been woven in place to a custom designed harness that guarantees correct placement of electrodes to support a diagnostic quality 12-lead ECG.&amp;nbsp; The electrodes themselves are connected to a small, battery powered, COTS ECG system that wireless transmits data to a custom developed software application that receives and processes the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dry electrodes replace the more traditional wet-prep electrodes that are single use devices with a specific expiration date.&amp;nbsp; The dry electrodes are multi-use devices and do not have an expiration date.&amp;nbsp; The custom harness essentially automates the process of lead placement which eliminates the &amp;ldquo;spaghetti&amp;rdquo; effect that often accompanies traditional ECG data collection and prevents the common clinical problem of lead wire misplacements and reversals.&amp;nbsp; By embedding dry electrodes and wires into the harness, don/doff times are significantly decreased while maintaining a high level of data integrity.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the custom software application simplifies and &amp;nbsp;streamlines the data collection process making the forwarding of ECG data a much easier process.&lt;/p&gt;",
