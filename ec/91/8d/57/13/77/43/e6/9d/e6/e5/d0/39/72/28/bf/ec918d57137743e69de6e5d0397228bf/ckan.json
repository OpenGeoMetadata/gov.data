  "notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) conducted this investigation during the summer of 1991 to: (1) determine the nature and extent of selenium, lead, and mercury contamination at Maxwell National Wildlife Refuge (Maxwell NWR), and (2) how such contamination might affect fish and wildlife resources. In 1989, a preliminary investigation revealed that selenium and mercury were present at potentially toxic levels in samples of biological tissue collected from the refuge. Eighteen sediment and 59 biological samples were collected at six sites on the refuge. Each sample was assayed for selenium, mercury and lead. Samples were assayed for lead because the detection limits in the 1989 study were not low enough to evaluate potential risks that this element might pose to fish and wildlife. Seven of 11 bird tissue samples collected contained potentially harmful levels of selenium. Embryos of two American avocets and a composite sample of three eared grebe embryos contained between 5.41 and 5.71 ug/g selenium dry weight (dwt). These concentrations of selenium have the potential to cause embryonic teratogenicity in birds nesting at Maxwell NWR. Four of 8 adult migratory bird livers contained concentrations of selenium which may cause nesting migratory birds at Maxwell NWR to experience some degree of adverse biological effects. Selenium concentrations were consistently higher in all sampled media from Seepage Wetland and Half Playa. All samples of aquatic invertebrates collected at Seepage Wetland and Half Playa contained a mean concentration of 17.7 and 19.0 ug/g dwt of selenium, respectively. Based on studies by Smith and Heinz (1990) and Heinz et al. (1989), the incidence of reproductive impairment significantly increases when avian food sources contain between 4.4 to 7.8 ug/g dwt of selenium as selenomethionine. The selenium concentrations detected in invertebrates in this study were well above this dietary threshold. Mercury and lead concentrations in all media sampled at Maxwell NWR appeared to be below levels of concern. Mercury was not detected in fillet or whole body portions of game-size fish from Lake No. 13, and was not detected in any of the sediment samples collected. Mercury was detected only in trace amounts in bird tissues. Lead was detected in almost all samples, but at low concentrations below levels of concern.",
