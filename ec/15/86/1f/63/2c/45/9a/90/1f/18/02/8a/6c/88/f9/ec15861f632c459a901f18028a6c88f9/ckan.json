    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Armstrong Flight Research Center is NASA&amp;rsquo;s primary center for atmospheric flight research and operations,&amp;nbsp;with a vision &amp;ldquo;to fly what others only imagine.&amp;rdquo; We believe that flight validation and research is one of&amp;nbsp;the crucial phases within the advancement of any NASA technology, and it is often the barrier to technology&amp;nbsp;utilization by the private sector. We also believe that aerospace technology can be enhanced through flight&amp;nbsp;early in the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) lifecycle. In fact, some research can be done only in flight. The&amp;nbsp;CIF projects are examples of aerospace technologies that are theoretically advantageous but have had&amp;nbsp;little TRL advancement or are at too early of a technology level for support through a NASA mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus for the program is on validating, developing, and testing new and innovative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current&amp;nbsp;technology areas for the projects included:&lt;br /&gt;AFRC is currently looking into following Technical Capability areas (not in any priority order and not all inclusive):&lt;br /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Small launch Space Systems&lt;br /&gt;Develop small launch space systems such as horizontal rockets that could launch to orbit small free-flying space platforms (e.g., cuestas, nanosats, picosats).&lt;br /&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Altitude Compensating Rocket Systems&lt;br /&gt;Design, build, and test altitude compensating rocket systems or sub-systems designed to operate the rocket efficiently across a wide range of altitudes. &amp;nbsp;Subsystems such as Altitude Compensating Nozzles are being considered.&lt;br /&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Aero Gravity Assist Systems&lt;br /&gt;Design, build, and test an Aerogravity assist system which uses a close approach to the planet, dipping into the atmosphere, so the spacecraft can also use aerodynamic lift to further curve the trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft Adaptive Controls&lt;br /&gt;Develop and test adaptive controls architectures speci?cally tailored for application to launch vehicles. &amp;nbsp;Adaptive Controls for launch vehicles would include unique features of the &amp;nbsp;aerospace vehicle, such as control-structure interaction, propellant slosh, sensor performance, and actuator dynamics. &amp;nbsp;In addition, the analysis, veri?cation, and ?ight certi?cation framework for the control system must be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Autonomous Systems&lt;br /&gt;AFRC is exploring concepts for advanced autonomous systems and collaborative autonomous operations that could be applied across aerospace vehicles to enhance effectiveness, survivability, and affordability.&lt;br /&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Autonomy in a Safety Critical Framework&lt;br /&gt;Armstrong Flight Research Center is interested in the flight demonstration of high level autonomy in a safety critical framework with applicability to man-rated air and space vehicles. &amp;nbsp;This high level of autonomy is enabled through the use of multiple sensor platforms and algorithms with high computational demands. &amp;nbsp;Increased computational capability through embedded high performance computing and implementation of resource efficient algorithms is needed to support this integration. &amp;nbsp;Research into embedded high performance computing using multi-core processors, FPGA, GPU, DSP and associated development of toolchains and algorithms targeted to these platforms is needed in order to reduce the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) of the flight vehicles..&lt;br /&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Space Weather Systems&lt;br /&gt;Design, develop, and test measurement systems to provide the capability for on-demand, validated, and archived radiation measurements related to human tissue and avionics silicon upset concerns.&lt;br /&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Electromagnetically Boosted Rockets&lt;br /&gt;One possible solution is to use an electromagnetic linear motor boost system to supplement the use of first stage booster rockets and rocket clusters. China Lake is currently advocating to NAVAIR to initiate a study of long term capital costs and recurring system operational costs of the use of an electromagnetic linear motor booster system for their rocket sled tracks as compared to the long term operational system costs of moving to a newer line of booster rocket production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
