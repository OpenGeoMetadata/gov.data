This dataset was compiled by Louisiana DOTD source data. The dataset includes selected data from the DOTD Surface Type Log file. The source dataset was derived from sources including USGS quads, aerial photography, highway plans, DOTD's control section road network and existing general highway maps. The source data set originated in 1983-1985 by digitizing 7.5' USGS quads on high precision input tables, but is updated regularly at LDOTD using the other sources mentioned above.",
