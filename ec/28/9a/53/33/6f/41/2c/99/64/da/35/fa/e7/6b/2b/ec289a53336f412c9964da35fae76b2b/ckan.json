    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "TDA Research, Inc. is developing a compact, low power, Next-Generation Exercise Device (NGRED) that can generate any force between 5 and 600 lbf. We use a closed loop control system and a servo motor to smoothly and accurately simulate the gravitational and inertial loads of lifting a weight on earth. However, because the system uses a computer-controlled motor, the load can be varied independently during the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise. Thus, the system can easily provide an eccentric overload during the return stroke, greatly increasing the physiological benefit of a workout. \r\n\r\nThe NGRED has a user-friendly interface where the exercise is selected from a drop-down menu, along with the desired weight and overload. The NGRED will automatically adjust to the user's stored range of motion (ROM) for the selected exercise and apply the set load only during the ROM. The NGRED automatically applies the eccentric overload at the top of the ROM and advances to the next rep at the bottom. The time required to change between users, exercises, and weights is less than 10 seconds. This makes much better use of the astronaut's time; with current mechanically adjustable exercise machines up to two thirds of the time is spent adjusting the machine. The software includes data logging and communication abilities to meet NASA requirements as well as redundant hardware and software fail-safe mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe NGRED includes an efficient energy recovery system which stores the energy generated by the user during the concentric phase of the motion (pull stroke) and applies that energy to provide resistance during the eccentric phase (return stroke). The average power consumption of the NGRED will be less than 50 W during an exercise session. The expected weight of the NGRED at the end of Phase II will be 20 kg, and the total volume is expected to be 55 L, including all electronics and controls. A flight-like NGRED will be delivered to NASA at the end of Phase II.",
