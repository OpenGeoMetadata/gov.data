    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "TRS Technologies proposes to develop a variety of single crystal actuators for adaptive optics deformable mirrors.  Single crystal piezoelectric actuators are proposed as a means of increasing actuator authority while maintaining strain precision for adaptive optics deformable mirrors used in future space observatory missions.  Single crystals based on PZN-PT or PMN-PT represent a revolutionary advance in piezoelectric actuator technology.  These materials exhibit 5 to 10 times the strain of conventional ceramic piezoelectrics with equivalent deliverable force.  Therefore, they offer a much broader design space for adaptive optics systems than is currently available with ceramic actuators, electric motors or magnetic devices.  The attributes of single crystals relevant to adaptive optics include: piezoelectric coefficients &gt; 2000 pm/V and field induced strains &gt; 0.5&#37;, blocking forces equivalent to conventional piezoelectric and electrostrictive ceramic, very low strain-electric field hysteresis for high strain precision, much broader operating temperature range than electrostrictive PMN ceramic, very good cryogenic performance, and very high transverse piezoelectric coefficients (d32 better than -1600 pm/V).  In the Phase I program TRS will measure the performance of both stack and flextensional-type actuators and SRS will model the impact of incorporating such actuators into state-of-the-art deformable mirror designs.
