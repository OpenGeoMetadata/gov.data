    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This work proposes to capitalize on our Phase I success in\nmonolithically integrating magneto-optic and magnetic materials with\nsemiconductor platforms in order to reduce the size and weight, as well\nas increase the performance, of NASA?s strategic optical systems.\nNonreciprocal components play extremely important role in laser systems\nand telecommunications. Currently all such components are discrete;\nthere are no fully monolithically integrated nonreciprocal components\navailable in the market. This work will use a novel technique,\nmetallorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) to achieve this feat.\nPhase I results have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in\nfabricating doped and undoped magneto-optic films, as well as buffer\nlayers, onto semiconductors.  Permanent magnet films were also grown\nwith sufficient strengths to bias the magneto-optic films for fully\nintegrated waveguide isolators. All of these materials will be optimized\nduring initial fabrication/characterization tasks in the Phase II\nprogram. Also, prototype devices will continue to be simulated using the\nbeam propagation method. These simulation results will allow a fast path\ntoward fabricating prototype devices with minimal processing/testing\niterations. Photonic circuitry with electric and magnetic drives and\nmagnetophotonic crystals will also be designed and developed in this\nPhase II program.",
