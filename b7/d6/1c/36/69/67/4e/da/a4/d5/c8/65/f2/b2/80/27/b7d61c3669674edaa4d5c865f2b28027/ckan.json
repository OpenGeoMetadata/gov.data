    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Sixteen tipping bucket rain gauge pairs were deployed alongside each Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU) during the Mid-latitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC3E) in northern Oklahoma.  Along with the disdrometers, these rain gauges provided an additional means for directly measuring rainfall during the MC3E campaign.  Two different models of these rain gauges, which are manufactured by MetOne Instruments, Inc., were used during MC3E.  The Model 380 gauges have a 30.5 cm diameter catchment funnel and a resolution of 0.2 mm of liquid water for each tip.  The Model 370 gauges have a 20.3 cm diameter catchment funnel and a resolution of 0.01 inches of liquid water for each tip.  The 0.2 mm resolution rain gauges were sited alongside APU01,02,10-16, whereas the 0.01 inches resolution rain gauges were sited alongside APU03-08.  The data for each rain gauge was collected at 1-minute intervals.  Data was collected from 22 April 2011 through 06 June 2011.",
