    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA is emphasizing the use of larger, more integrated models in conjunction with systems engineering tools and decision support systems. These tools place a corresponding stress on legacy engineering visualization systems which now are required to handle larger data sets, provide more intuition to the user, integrate well with many other tools, and help the user with his/her ultimate goal: improving the design of complex systems.    \r\nPhoenix Integration proposes to complete the prototype visualization environment created during Phase I to the point where it is a commercially viable product. New features, refinements, and integration with other tools will be accomplished in Phase II. In particular, the work will involve major improvements to whitespace exploration algorithms, techniques that enable users to unconstrain or modify the underlying engineering model in an effort to obtain results in previously unattainable areas. Work will also include more data mining algorithms (e.g. Principal Component Analysis), new graph types (e.g. spider plots), export formats to 3-D tools (e.g. Tecplot), integration with MBSE/SysML tools, integration with web-based decision support environments, and incorporation of probabilistic analysis. A rich integration with ModelCenter, the company's engineering integration and trade study environment, is planned, although a standalone capability will also be offered. The visualizer's architecture will be based on OpenGL and will use the GPU to parallelize rendering computations. Design will focus on usability and responsiveness, with the goal of providing quick insight into complex data. The tool will be user-tested through early adopters to ensure relevance and to guide development.",
