  "notes": "Surveys for adult invertebrates that were part of the hull fouling communities were done to determine to what extent marine alien invasive species (AIS) are being transported in this fashion. The focus was to perform a qualitative analysis that created a species inventory. The organisms that generally foul vessel hulls are the typical species found in natural marine intertidal and subtidal fouling communities. These organisms are usually associated with one of the following groups: porifera (sponges), coelenterata (hydroids, corals and anemones), mollusca (mussels, clams, and sea slugs), annelida (marine worms), arthropoda (barnacles, amphipods, and crabs), bryozoa (moss animals), chordata (sea squirts and fish), as well as macroalgae (seaweed). Through collaboration with state and private industry representatives, arrivals notification for various vessel types was received. This arrivals information was used to schedule field survey activities throughout the study. Field work occurred in 2003 at harbors of southern and southwestern coasts of Oahu, Hawaii.",
