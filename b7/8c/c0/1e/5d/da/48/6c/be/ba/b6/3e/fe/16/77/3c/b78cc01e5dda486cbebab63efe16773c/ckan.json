    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Systems Project demonstrates nuclear power technology readiness to support the goals of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Space Technology Mission Directorate. To this end, the project will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate subsystem-level technology readiness in a relevant environment (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish a hardware-based technical foundation for fission power system (FPS) design concepts and reduce risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Validate a FPS concept that meets exploration power requirements at reasonable cost with added benefits over competitive options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the cost uncertainties for FPS and establish greater credibility for flight system cost estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate the key gate products that will allow Agency decision-makers to consider fission power as a viable option to proceed to flight development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Systems Project is aligned with STMD&amp;rsquo;s Roadmap on Space Power and Energy Storage (TA-03) and addresses a key milestone for a non-nuclear subsystem demonstration of a &amp;ldquo;workhorse&amp;rdquo; 10-100 kWe fission system.&amp;nbsp; The National Research Council&amp;rsquo;s review of the STMD Roadmap identifies Fission Power Generation as one of the top 16 NASA technology development priorities.&amp;nbsp; The STMD Roadmap clearly recognizes the importance of the planned non-nuclear demonstration as a crucial step in deploying an initial space fission system and a foundation for follow-on fission power system technology development.&amp;nbsp; While the 10-100 kWe class system is ideally suited for lunar and Mars surface power, the component technologies are readily adaptable to larger megawatt-class systems for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) missions.&amp;nbsp; Further, the analytical tools and non-nuclear testing strategies that will be exercised in this project can be applied to the megawatt systems as well as lower power (kilowatt-class) systems that may be needed for space science missions that exceed current Radioisotope Power System (RPS) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;",
