  "notes": "This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant recharge value for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake in east-central Oklahoma. Ground water in 710 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer, composed of alluvial and terrace deposits, consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The aquifer is underlain and in hydraulic connection with the upper zone of the Permian-age Garber-Wellington aquifer and the Pennsylvanian-age Ada-Vamoosa aquifer. Some of the polygon boundaries were digitized from a published ground-water modeling report about the aquifer and some lines were extracted from published digital geology data sets. Recharge was estimated to range from 1.7 inches per year in the west to 7.0 inches per year in the east, with an average of 3.3 inches per year in the published ground-water modeling report. The recharge values used as input to the ground-water flow model were not published and were not available from any other source. Therefore, the alluvial and terrace deposits were assigned the average recharge value of 3.3 inches per year in this data set. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

Some of the model-grid boundaries (Havens, 1989, plate 6) were digitized from a paper-base map with a maximum registration root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0135 map inches (0.0053 map centimeters). Recharge polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site-specific. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
