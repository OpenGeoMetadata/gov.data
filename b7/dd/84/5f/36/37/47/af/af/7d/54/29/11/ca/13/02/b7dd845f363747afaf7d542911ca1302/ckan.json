    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides soil maps for the United States (US) (including Alaska), Canada, Mexico, and a part of Guatemala. The map information content includes maximum soil depth and eight soil attributes including sand, silt, and clay content, gravel content, organic carbon content, pH, cation exchange capacity, and bulk density for the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) and the subsoil layer (30-100 cm). The spatial resolution is 0.25 degree. The Unified North American Soil Map (UNASM) combined information from the state-of-the-art US General Soil Map (STATSGO2) and Soil Landscape of Canada (SLCs) databases. The area not covered by these data sets was filled by using the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 (HWSD1.21). The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon (NCSCD) database was used to provide more accurate and up-to-date soil organic carbon information for the high-latitude permafrost region and was combined with soil organic carbon content derived from the UNASM (Liu et al., 2013). The UNASM data were utilized in the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The compilation of these data was facilitated by the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC). MAST-DC was a component of the NACP (www.nacarbon.org) designed to support NACP by providing data products and data management services needed for modeling and synthesis activities.",
