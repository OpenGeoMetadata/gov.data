    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "History has repeatedly shown that combustion instability is the greatest technical risk faced in any chemical propulsion development program. The UCDS Process addresses this issue by using a rigorous physics-based analytical framework to decompose the complex flow field inside a chemical propulsion device, such as a liquid or solid rocket, in a way that allows rapid simulation of the dynamic behavior.  Using UCDS it is possible to generate high fidelity predictions of the time evolution, amplitude and waveform of a pressure oscillation, along with any changes to the mean properties due to non-linear effects.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the modal Alpha (linear growth rate) is a key physical parameter that defines the dynamic behavior of a rocket and provides a reliable measure of combustion stability margin.\r\nBy monitoring how the array of modal Alphas change with design or operational features, the effects on engine combustion stability can be predicted.  This insight provides the means to eliminate instability without resorting to expensive cut-and-try iterative developmental testing.  GTL proposes to use this design guideline and the UCDS&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; Process to create a clean-sheet design for a new liquid rocket that is inherently stable and compare it to an existing engine.  \r\n",
