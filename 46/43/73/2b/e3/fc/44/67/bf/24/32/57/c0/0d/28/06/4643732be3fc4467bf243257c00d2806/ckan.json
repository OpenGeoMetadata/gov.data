    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiometric calibration is critical to many NASA activities.&amp;nbsp; At NASA SSC, imaging cameras have been used in-situ to monitor propulsion test stand activities.&amp;nbsp; Radiometric calibration can help analyze the illumination produced by a test article during firing in order to detect defects or stop a test if required.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory calibrations are typically performed using stable NIST traceable integrating sphere-based calibrated sources.&amp;nbsp; After launch, calibration is maintained using on-board calibration sources, ground-based vicarious calibration campaigns, and sometimes stellar and/or lunar calibration approaches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST traceable integrating sphere based radiometric calibration sources have been used for several decades. An integrating sphere source is a spherical shell coated with highly reflective diffuse material that is illuminated either internally or externally. &amp;nbsp;These spheres have ports that allow light to enter or exit. Sometimes the integrating sphere source will have a detector or spectrometer to monitor its output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An observatory class calibrator (~1.2-1.5 m in diameter) can radiometrically calibrate imaging systems over the 360-2500 nm (UV-SWIR) spectral range by incorporating tungsten lamps into the design. &amp;nbsp;In this project, LEDs were combined with tungsten lamps to produce a UV-SWIR source. &amp;nbsp;Operating the tungsten lamp at temperatures lower than their normal limits extends their lifetime while only slightly reducing their SWIR output. &amp;nbsp;Since operating at lower temperatures also lowers illumination in the UV and visible spectrum, LEDs were used to fill in that part of the spectrum. &amp;nbsp;In this way, the light source was made stable for better than a few percent for 1000 hours or more as compared to the typical 50 hours for traditional light sources. &amp;nbsp;This feature improved the robustness of the calibration source and potentially reduces future maintenance costs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
