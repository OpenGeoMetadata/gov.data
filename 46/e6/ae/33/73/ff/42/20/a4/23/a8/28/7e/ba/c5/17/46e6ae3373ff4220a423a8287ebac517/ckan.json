    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "SSCI and MIT propose to further develop, implement and test the Integrated Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (IMPACT) system software for autonomous ISR missions employing collaborating UAVs. IMPACT system is based on real-time learning about dynamic and stochastic environments, and on a capability to autonomously react to contingencies while satisfying the mission objectives and the overall flight safety. \r\nPhase II focus will be on real-time vehicle assignment &amp; trajectory planning technologies for forest fire monitoring, overall system integration, and evaluation of its performance through computer and hardware-in-the-loop simulations and flight tests at Olin College or Great Dismal Swamp. Key technologies to be further developed &amp; tested in Phase II include: (i) Vehicle assignment &amp; real time trajectory generation for \r\ncollaborative ISR for fire boundary identification using the MOTOR system (Multi-objective Trajectory Optimization &amp; Re-planning); (ii) Robust on-line learning for prediction of the fire spread using the \r\nintelligent Cooperative Control Architecture (iCCA); (iii) Collaborative assignment for fire perimeter tracking with reactive trajectory planning based on predicted fire spread using MOTOR and iCCA; (iv) Contingency management, including the loss of vehicle, vehicle replacement &amp; mitigation of lost communication link; and (v)\r\nPredictive camera pointing control based on predicted fire spread. The project will leverage a number of technologies recently developed by SSCI and MIT, and integrate various system modules within a flexible and \r\nuser-friendly software product. Phase II deliverables will include the IMPACT software and accompanying documentation, while Phase III will be focused on commercialization of the IMPACT software.",
