  "notes": "These data come from observations of breeding tricolored blackbirds throughout their range in California. NAD27 coordinates are given in the data for each record. But, the shapefile is converted to NAD83 and projected using that datum in the BIOS viewer. For further information please see \"Tricolored Blackbird Status Update and Management Guidelines,\" September, 1997, available at http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/info/bm_research/bm_pdfrpts/97_07.pdf . TIME PERIOD COVERED. There are records from 1980 through 2000. However, less than 35 records are from prior to 1992. There are from 113 to 202 records per year from 1993 through 2000 except for considerably fewer records in 1993 and only four records from 1998. Major statewide surveys were conducted in 1994, organized by California Audubon, and in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999, cosponsored by the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These data do not include a survey organized by Point Reyes Bird Observatory in 2001. NUMBER OF RECORDS. There are 1091 records of breeding tricolored blackbirds. A number of these records represent surveys of the same colony made in different years. GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT OF THE RECORDS. These records are distributed across 48 counties and include 10 observations in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon and a record from Baja California. However, the majority come from the Central Valley with a lesser number from central and south coast areas. BASE DATA STRUCTURE. The base data is maintained in a .dbf format database by the Wildlife and Habitat Data Analysis Branch at the California Department of Fish and Game. Though there is a similar database of negative observations, that information is not included here. WHAT EACH RECORD REPRESENTS. Each record contains information on the date of the observation, the estimated size of the breeding colony, the vegetation used by the nesting birds, and the location of",
