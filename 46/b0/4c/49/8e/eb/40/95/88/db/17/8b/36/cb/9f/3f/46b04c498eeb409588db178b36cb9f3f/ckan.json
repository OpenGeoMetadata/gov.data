    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this work is to determine the optimal process for manufacturing lightweight linerless cryogenic storage tanks using ionic liquid epoxy composite material that can compete with metallic tanks currently in use.  \r\nIonic liquids, because of their unique properties such as low volatility, low flammability, and flexibility of chemical design are showing promise as the next generation of chemical reagents.   Mechanical and chemical testing to date has shown that this IL epoxy monomer, when cured with a commercial aromatic diamine curing agent, yields a polymer resin with high tensile strength, excellent bond strength to aluminum and steel, high toughness, low CTE, and low moisture permeability.  Performance comparisons of the ILE to several commercial epoxies showed the ILE had superior tensile and bond strengths.  Of particular importance is that these properties of the ILE were even better at cryogenic temperatures because of the low crystallinity inherent in the polymer as a consequence of the chemical nature of ionic liquids. \r\nIn this Phase I effort, a battery of tests will be carried out at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures on coupons prepared preferably on a filament winder using the wet winding technique.  Hand layup may also be used to make small defect-free samples.  Samples for tensile, lap-shear and bend (for interlaminar shear strength) will be cut from these.   Potholing or surface degradation, microcracking and delamination will be reported and quantified if found.\r\n",
