    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The DXC Framework is a collection of programs and APIs for running and evaluating diagnostic algorithms (DAs). It is complementary to system XML catalogs and datasets. A DXC Framework installer for Windows may also be downloaded. Competitors must submit DAs that can communicate with and be executed by the DXC Framework. It was designed primarily for the Diagnostic Competition and future competitions, however, it is lightweight and reusable in any context where data from one or more sources needs to be communicated to, processed by, and diagnosed by reasoners. It is distributed under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nContents: APIs- The Java and C++ DXC APIs provide the classes and functionality necessary for data exchange.\r\n\r\nScenario Execution Software - A scenario is an interval of time in which system data is sent to a diagnostic algorithm. StandaloneSDS is used to execute one scenario on its own and send the results to a file. ScenarioLoader is for executing a large collection of scenarios with one or more DAs in an automated fashion (as is necessary to perform benchmarking of algorithms).\r\n\r\nExample Diagnostic Algorithms - Two minimal example DAs are provided (along with source code) to demonstrate proper use of the APIs--one in C++, the other in Java.\r\n\r\n#Updates to the DXC Framework:\r\n\r\nThis DxcFramework update (DxcFramework-1.1.zip) provides several important bugfixes and new features (see below). Your questions, feedback and suggestions have been very helpful in improving the software--please continue sending them. A DXC Framework installer update for Windows (DxcFramework-1.1.msi) may also be downloaded.\r\n\r\nDxcFramework 1.1 Changelog:\r\n\r\n    * Added Evaluator. The Evaluator takes the output generated by scenario execution (stored in ./Scenarios/Results/) and calculates DA evaluation metrics. See README for more information. Cpu time and peak memory usage are currently not reported in Linux, this will change.\r\n    * Added SystemCatalog class for basic XML catalog parsing and validation.\r\n    * Included system catalogs and example scenarios for one system from each track.\r\n    * New StandaloneSDS options: -t: specify wait time (in seconds) to keep listening for diagnoses after scenario end. -v: validate scenarios against corresponding system catalog (Not available in JavaSSDS). Catalogs must be placed in $DXC_HOME/SystemCatalogs, unless a different directory is specified in Dxc.cfg SYSTEMCAT_DIR.\r\n    * Added JavaStandaloneSDS execution script, now just run \"JavaStandaloneSDS\"\r\n    * Scenario timing changes. DA startup timeout now 20 seconds. Added 20 second post-scenario wait period to allow DAs to send final diagnosis and exit.\r\n    * Scenario timing values can now be edited in Dxc.cfg (values are in milliseconds). Current values reflect our planned competition scenario conditions. Competitors will be notified of any changes to these values.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Evaluator Update\r\nPlease follow these instructions to update the Evaluator in the Framework (see Evaluator.zip below):\r\n\r\n   1. Make sure your version of DXC Framework is the most recent (1.1). Source release users, ensure that Java code is built.\r\n   2. Move the copy of Evaluator.jar contained in $DXC_HOME/Bin to Evaluator.jar.backup.\r\n   3. Save new Evaluator.jar to $DXC_HOME/Bin.\r\n   4. Choose desired config file and save to $DXC_HOME (top-level directory), renaming to evalCfg.xml. Use evalCfg.xml.industrial for industrial track metrics/scoring, evalCfg.xml.synthetic for synthetic.\r\n   5. Run \"Evaluator > results.txt\" (or similar) at the command line. Evaluator will calculate metrics and scores for results files it finds in $DXC_HOME/Scenarios/Results.\r\n",
