    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this Phase II proposal we plan to design and develop a semiconductor, low phase/frequency noise, single-frequency, external cavity semiconductor laser (ECL) emitting at 1064 nm for use in high-precision outer space measurement NASA missions.  Many NASA space missions rely on the utilization of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) techniques for atmospheric analysis and/or surface topography and distance measurement.  A key and vital component of any LIDAR system is the laser source. Single frequency lasers are highly desirable for use in planned missions using LIDAR systems.\r\n\r\nThe laser is based on the PLANEX&amp;#61652; laser technology developed by Redfern Integrated Optics Inc. (RIO).  The PLANEX&amp;#61652; 1550 nm laser was originally designed and developed for terrestrial applications but it has been experimentally demonstrated to have a sufficiently low level of frequency and intensity noise to be suitable for precision measurement applications, such as those encountered in spaceborne LIDAR.\r\n\r\nFor the Phase II effort, we propose to carry out a plan to design and develop a 1064 nm PLANEX laser for NASA LIDAR applications which will be based on the RIO PLANEX ECL originally designed for emission at 1550 nm, but need re-design for different semiconductor materials, fabrication processes and opto-electronic packaging for operation at 1064 nm wavelength in outer space.",
