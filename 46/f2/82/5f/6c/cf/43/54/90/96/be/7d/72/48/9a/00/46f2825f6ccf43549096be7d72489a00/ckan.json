    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Aviation safety systems have undergone dramatic changes over the past fifty years.  If you take a look at the early technology in this area, you'll see that there was a lot of work done in the area of so-called 'built-in-testing' (BIT) which essentially tests connectivity between different components.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnology has moved forward very far since that time.  With the massive storage systems and advanced sensors and other communications systems, we are now able to capture and store vast quantities of health and control related data.  This data is usually stored off-line for future analysis.  In many cases, we also have an abundance of human-written text reports that relate to known safety issues.  A key problem is to 'look' across all these data sources in order to find precursors to safety events.  Although humans do look at many aspects of the data, it is difficult, if not impossible for them to integrate all the information available in a meaningful way. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOther industries face this glut of data in their own way.  Businesses have invested heavily in business intelligence products based on data mining that are designed to convert data into actionable information to maximize their profits or other metrics.  The IVHM project is investing in data mining technologies to help sift through these massive data sets to uncover actionable information from a safety perspective.  I've attached a presentation that Irv Statler and I gave at NASA HQ on this subject during an Aeronautics Technical Seminar. A video of the talk is also included.  It's about 90 minutes long, so grab some popcorn.  :) ",
