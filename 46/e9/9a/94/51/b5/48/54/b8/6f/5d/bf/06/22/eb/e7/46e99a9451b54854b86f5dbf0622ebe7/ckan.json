    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "SySense, Inc. proposes to develop a framework for the design and implementation of fault detection and isolation (FDI) systems. The framework will include protocols which define how to work with an end customer so that an FDI system may be developed for a wide range of autonomous satellite, rocket, air, land, and underwater vehicle missions. The framework will define what kinds of data and information are needed a priori in order to design the FDI system, what kinds of mission requirements can be answered with the system, and how the system should be implemented in order to meet those requirements. The framework will also include the procedure to facilitate the efficient integration of our FDI methodology into both existing and planned systems. Clearly defining the FDI design process through this framework will make the technology more accessible to mission designers and lower the cost of implementation, providing more opportunities to apply this technology.  The efficacy of the framework will be confirmed by designing and implementing collocated and non-collocated FDI systems for a representative satellite mission. The framework will also include introductory tutorial material designed for mission planners.",
