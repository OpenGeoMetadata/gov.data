    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In Topic Z1.01, NASA seeks advanced photovoltaic technologies that can deliver cost, reliability, mass, volume and efficiency gains over current solutions.  Future photovoltaic systems range in size from Cubesat-class to International Space Station sized arrays.  Operational domains range from low Earth orbit to interplanetary distances.  Power levels may reach 100's of kilowatts operating at several hundred volts.  Specific power of greater than 130 w/kg, and stowed volumes 4 times denser than the current state of the art are required.  These functional parameters drive the need for large flexible blanket arrays comprised of solar cell modules assembled in myriad configurations.  Manufacturers of flexible solar arrays currently use manual processes to accomplish final assembly.  NASA's cost and reliability goals require new approaches to manufacturing.  Building on recent successes in flexible substrate photovoltaics, our proposed effort creates a preliminary design for an automated final assembly manufacturing cell for flexible blanket solar arrays.  Modular, scalable, and flexible, the proposed system incorporates the latest in machine vision, material handling, laser welding, and automated test capabilities.  When fully implemented in Phase II, the system will deliver immediate return on NASA's investment through labor reductions and reliability improvements.  Missions from across NASA's entire portfolio will benefit from the significant cost savings, allowing fiscal resources to be focused on the primary scientific or operational goal.",
