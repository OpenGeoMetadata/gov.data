    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains eight data files (.txt format): three net primary productivity (NPP) data files and five climate data files. The NPP estimates are based on field measurements of litterfall accumulation at three tropical rainforest sub-sites near Atherton, Queensland, in northeast Australia. Additional NPP component data include standing litter biomass, leaf decomposition rates, and nutrient concentrations in litter, where available. Precipitation and temperature data are provided from measurements at two of the study sites, nearby weather stations, and from published literature sources. Annual litterfall estimates are based on weekly or bi-weekly measurements for 3-4 years (1974/5-1978) at the Wongabel (17.32 S 145.50 E) and the Gadgarra (17.30 S 145.72 E) State Forest Reserves, and weekly measurements for 5 years (1980-1985) at Tableland (17.28 S 145.57 E) near Atherton. Additional measurements were made at Wongabel and Gadgarra including branchfall (monthly); litter on the forest floor (quarterly); rainfall and throughfall (weekly); and trace element concentrations in litterfall (weekly or bi-weekly). In a related study at Gadgarra, litterfall and standing litter crop were sampled at approximately 19-day intervals from 1974 to 1976 and at approximately 3-month intervals 1976 to 1978. Total litterfall averaged 905 g/m2/year at Wongabel, 987 g/m2/year at Gadgarra, and 1,103 g/m2/year at Tableland, giving minimum estimates of above-ground NPP for this region of Australia and an indication of tropical forest productivity south of the Equator. Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally published in 2001. ",
