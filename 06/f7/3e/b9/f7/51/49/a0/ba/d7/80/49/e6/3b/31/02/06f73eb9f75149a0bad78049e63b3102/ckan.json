    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A non-intrusive method for measuring velocities in a rocket exhaust is proposed in a joint effort by MetroLaser and Vanderbilt University. Hydroxyl Tagging Velocimetry (HTV) uses an ultraviolet laser to tag a region of the flow with OH molecules, and interrogates them after a short delay with a second laser to obtain velocity from time-of-flight data. The method relies on the dissociation of H2O molecules naturally present in the flow, and thus requires no seeding. Being an all-optical technique, it is not adversely affected by high temperatures or high dynamic pressures. Analyses and experiments conducted during the Phase I effort demonstrated feasibility by showing that OH tag lifetimes in a simulated rocket exhaust environment were sufficiently long to enable accurate determination of tag displacements corresponding to typical rocket exhaust velocities. The method was demonstrated by measuring velocities in the exhaust gases of a laboratory scale burner at temperatures and chemical compositions representative of a H2/O2 rocket exhaust. Design tradeoff studies predicted that at measurement ranges of 20 to 50 feet the accuracies would be from two to five percent. This proposal outlines a plan to develop a prototype HTV instrument and demonstrate it in a rocket engine exhaust.",
