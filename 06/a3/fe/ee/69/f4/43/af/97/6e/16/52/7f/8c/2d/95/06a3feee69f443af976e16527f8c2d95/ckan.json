  "notes": "   Description:  HMDS (hexamethyldisilzane) promotes photoresist adhesion by creating a bond between the resist and silicon. The silizanes bond to the silicon in the wafer while the methyls bond with the photoresist. Vapor priming allows for HMDS application in a monolayer and reduces the chance of contamination.   Specifications / Capabilities:   Quality of Coating   Surface dehydration and subsequent vapor priming results in chemical bonding to surface hydroxyl ions, not weakly bound surface moisture Reesulting coatings are repeatable and stable for extended periods   Efficiency of Chemical Usage   Uses less than 5 ml to coat up to 200 wafers System uses pure HMDS so there is no possibility of variation due to changes in carrier concentration   Waste Disposal   Virtually no waste - no liquid solvents or residues to dispose of   Flexibility of Substrate Size and Shape   Any size and shape substrate can be treated with equal efficiency up to 16&amp;quot; There are no issues with flow effects or substrate topology due to use of vapor   Flexibility of Type of Substrate   Delicate or difficult substrates can be accommodated with simple temperature or recipie changes With no substrate movement during priming, there is no risk of breakage or other damage   HMDS is stored in the system under vacuum   Chemical does not degrade from exposure to moisture in the air Operators are not exposed to fumes from the HMDS or carrier solvent  ",
