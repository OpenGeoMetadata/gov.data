    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this project, KWJ proposes to develop a low power, fast response, lightweight miniature CH4 measurement system based on KWJ nano-TCD sensor for airborne measurement operation. KWJ has developed patented sub-&amp;#181;m dimension TCDs, with ultra low power consumption (&lt;10&amp;#181;W), &lt;1&amp;#181;sec response time, very high stability (&gt;10^9 measurements without re-calibration), and coupling with simple electronic circuits and algorithms. In Phase I, KWJ will fabricate nano-TCD CH4 sensor, improve the sensitivity such that 5ppm accuracy will be obtained, and characterize the sensor on a bench-top testing system to demonstrate CH4 detection with all target specifications. In Phase II, the prototype sensing system (1cmx1cm, 10g package) will be built and integrated with NASA UAVs for field testing.  The proposed sensor will be ideal for airborne gas surveys.  This sensor is part of a broader effort to develop smaller, faster, lower power and more cost effective alternative sensors for a wide range of applications. This platform will advance not only the research fields of atmospheric research, climate change, global change biology, and ecology, but for NASA's future spacecraft programs as well as KWJ's own terrestrial-industrial applications. This work has synergy within NASA and can collaborate with ongoing NASA SiC sensor developments in Phase II.",
