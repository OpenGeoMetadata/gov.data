  "notes": "This is a survey of federal departments and agencies who share terrorism information and are therefore considered part of the Information Sharing Environment. The ISE Performance Framework allows us to assess improvements to the nation's ability to detect, analyze, and respond to terrorism, WMD, and homeland security threats. The goals and sub-¬êgoals in the framework are aligned to the White House's strategic guidance, priorities, and to the required ISE attributes in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Section 1016(b)(2). This year's data is a survey of Air Force Intelligence; Central Intelligence Agency; Department of Commerce; Department of Defense; Department of Energy; Department of Health and Human Services; Department of Homeland Security; Department of Interior; Department of Justice; Department of State; Department of Transportation; Department of the Treasury; National Geospatial Agency; National Reconnaissance Office; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Acquisition, Technology, and Facilities; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Office of the Chief Information Officer; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Civil Liberties and Privacy Office; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Deputy Director for Intelligence Integration; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - National Counterterrorism Center; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Systems, Resources, and Analysis; Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Mission Support Division; and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Policy & Strategy.",
