  "notes": "This investigation was conducted in 1988, 1989 and 1990 at abandoned military facilities on Attu, Tanaga, Little Kiska, Great Sitkin, and Semisopochnoi islands - all are located within the Aleutian Islands Subunit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) (Figure 1). The Principal Investigator was Wayne M. Crayton from the Ecological Services Anchorage field office, who was assisted by Nancy Norvell and other staff from the Refuge. In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) conducted a similar investigation on abandoned and active military facilities on Kiska, Adak, Agattu, and Great Sitkin islands (Crayton, 1990). Both investigations centered on determining what, if any, contaminants (i.e., organochlorines, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, inorganics) from military activities may have entered the surrounding refuge environment. Organochlorine compounds are normally associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides and other biological control agents. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in nature but it is the anthropogenic-derived compounds (usually petroleumrelated) that pose the greatest environmental threat. Inorganics are comprised of biologically essential (e.g. iron, zinc) and non-essential (e.g. mercury, lead) elements which typically are found in concentrations less than 1 part per million (ppm). Each project site is known to contain \"petroleum, oil, and lubricant products\" (POLs) and spills and electrical transformers which may contain PCBs. Extensive leaching of POLs and PCBs into the surrounding environment, depending on their chemical makeup and concentration, could pose a threat to fish and wildlife resources. The Service's effort to determine the presence or absence of contaminants at the abandoned facilities is necessary because there is a potential for contaminants to be transferred through the food chain to Service trust resources (migratory birds, anadromous fish). The Department of Defense has initiated a program [Defense Environmental Restoration Program (Program), P.L. 98-212,97 Stat. 1427, Dec. 8, 1983] designed to identify, evaluate, and cleanup hazardous waste sites on abandoned military bases and restore the areas to their near original state by implementing remedial actions. The Program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund regulations. Of the five abandoned military facilities being investigated by the Service, only Tanaga Island has had a Corps-sponsored site investigation. No Corp-sponsored cleanup has occurred on any of the islands to date. Included in this report is a summary of field activities, and an interpretation of analytical data. Contaminated sites requiring remediation activities and recommendations for additional study and cleanup are also identified for use by the Refuge manager in administering the refuge.",
