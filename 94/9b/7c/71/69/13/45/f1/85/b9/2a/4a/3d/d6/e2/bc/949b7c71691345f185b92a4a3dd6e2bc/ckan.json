  "notes": "USGS high resolution orthorectified images from The National Map combine the image characteristics of an aerial photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. Data received at EROS were reprojected from source projection to a standard utm projection and resolution resampled to align to the U.S. National Grid (USNG) using The National Map. The naming convention is based on the USNG, taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. The metadata were imported and updated for display through The National Map at https://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html Image-level metadata are provided in HTML and XML format. Data were compressed utilizing IAS software. The compression was JPEG2000 Lossy Compressed. The file format created was .jp2.",
