    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NanoSonic proposes to design and develop light-weight, low-modulus, and durable Metal Rubber sensors for aeroelastic analysis of inflatable/flexible entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems, which would in effect increase the systems aerodynamic stability by contributing to optimize its design.  More specifically, a network of small Metal Rubber strain sensors would provide a non-invasive mechanism to monitor loading of the inflatable deceleration and landing systems.  The in-situ Metal Rubber strain sensors would be utilized to monitor drag and instability of the system at varying Mach flow regimes by analyzing dynamic structure forces and also billowing effects (or similar shape-change / inflation effects) of the inflatable system as it goes through EDL operations.  The novel Metal Rubber sensors have proven the ability to monitor aerodynamic events, particularly shear and normal forces, based on their response to applied strain. These previous sensor technological advancements will be modified to develop the proposed sensor system for monitoring dynamic loading of the inflatable structure.  Lightweight Metal Rubber sensor appliques can be attached onto the inflatable base material or integrated in/under the system coating matrix for in-situ non-invasive monitoring.",
