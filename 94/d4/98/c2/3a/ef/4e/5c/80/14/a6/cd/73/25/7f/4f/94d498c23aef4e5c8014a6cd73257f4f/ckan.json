    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Light propagation in the sea and the consequent remote sensing signals seen by aircraft and spacecraft is fundamentally governed by the inherent optical properties (IOP) of the water, which is known to vary in all 4 dimensions, i.e. space and time. No versatile, non-moving full 0-pi volume scattering function sensing system exists at this time, although this company has developed an all solid state small forward angle system, LISST (The system was originall designed as a particle size distribution sensor, LISST-100; it would continue to have this capability), and a (moving-parts)scanning non-autonomous system was developed by a Ukrainian group. At the current time, this PI is building a backscatter system with ONR support to observe the Mueller matrix from 177-180 degrees. Intermediate angles are not reachable. In this proposal, I will build an all-solid state system combining the forward and backward angles, with side angles. We use an innovative solution to cover the wide dynamic range of the VSF. Along with VSF, the system shall measure beam attenuation (hence the phase function), and temperature and depth as auxiliary measurements. It will be battery operated and will have on-board data storage. At the heart of the innovation is a relatively new laser, novel drift-compensated detector set, and an innovative detector placement to streamline the system. ",
