    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "National Aeronautical and Space Administration's (NASA) Aviation Safety Program \"seeks capabilities furthering the practice of proactive safety management.\"  Specifically, one of the key interests in Topic A1.04 are proposals for Remaining Useful Life prediction techniques.  In response, Nokomis is proposing to develop an Electronic Health Monitoring (EHM) Sensor Unit which would be able provide accurate estimates of the Remaining Useful Life of avionic systems.  This sensor module would identify changes in the unintended electronic emissions of various flight-system electronic components to determine the current health state and predict the future reliability of the scanned system.  Designed as a handheld unit which would allow for system scans of components while installed in the aircraft, the EHM Sensor Unit would be capable of scanning and returning results in as little as 3 seconds per system scanned.  This speed would allow for frequent maintenance monitoring, including during the brief turnaround periods experienced at the gate.  This technology would allow NASA, as well as flight-system and aviation maintenance providers, to better monitor the electronic health of these critical avionic components, as well as better predict their future lifespan, allowing for systems to be repaired or replaced prior to an unanticipated failure.",
