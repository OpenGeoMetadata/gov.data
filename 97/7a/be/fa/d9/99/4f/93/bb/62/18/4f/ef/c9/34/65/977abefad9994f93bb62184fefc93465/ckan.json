The vector file is included in \"TransgressiveContours_BolinastoPescadero.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/BolinastoPescadero/data_catalog_BolinastoPescadero.html. These transgressive contours for the Bolinas to Pescadero region are published in Scientific Investigations Map 3306, \"California State Waters Map Series--Offshore San Gregorio, California\" (see sheet 9). In addition, these transgressive contours will be published in five future California State Waters Map Series Open-File Reports of the region (namely, the Offshore of San Francisco, Offshore of Pacifica, Offshore of Half Moon Bay, Offshore of San Gregorio, and Offshore of Pigeon Point map areas). As part of the USGS's California State Waters Mapping Project, a 50-m grid of depth to the transgressive surface of the last glacial maximum was generated for the areas within the 3-nautical mile limit between Bolinas and Pescadero was generated from seismic-reflection data collected in 2010 (USGS activity (S-15-10-NC) and 2007 (F-2-07-NC) supplemented with outcrop and geologic structure as mapped by Watt and others (Sheet 8, Sheet 10). The resulting grid covers an area of approximately 550 sq km. The depth to the transgressive surface of the Last Glacial Maximum ranges between 4 and 78 meters.",
