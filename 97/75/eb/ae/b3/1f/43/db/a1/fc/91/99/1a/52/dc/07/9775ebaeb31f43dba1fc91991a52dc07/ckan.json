    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This element involves the development of software that enables easier commanding of a wide range of NASA relevant robots through the Robot Application Programming Interface Delegate (RAPID) robot messaging system and infusing the developed software into flight projects.&amp;nbsp; In June and July of 2013, RAPID was tested on ISS as the robot messaging software for the Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) Human Exploration Telerobotics (HET) Surface Telerobotics experiment.&amp;nbsp; RAPID has also been made available to &amp;mdash; and integrated with &amp;mdash; the Robot Operating System (ROS), a popular software framework for developing state-of-the-art robots for ground and space. While ROS powers a number of new robots and components such as Robonaut 2&amp;rsquo;s climbing legs and R5, the addition of RAPID allows these robots to interoperate in collaborative human-robot teams, safely and effectively over time-delayed communications links. The objective this year is to take this space-tested software and extend it to providing video streaming from remote robots and delivering this new capability to the Exploration Ground Data Systems (xGDS) area within HRS.&amp;nbsp; xGDS will then deliver its software to Science Mission Directorate (SMD) funded field tests to improve the technology readiness moving leading (potentially) to being used for the Lunar Prospector Mission ground data systems.&amp;nbsp; Success will involve delivering RAPID to xGDS and then xGDS supporting SMD field test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is also developing algorithms for sensors capable of reconstructing remote worlds and efficiently shipping that remote environment back to earth using the RAPID robot messaging system.&amp;nbsp; This type of system could eventually lead to scientists on earth gain new insights as they are able to step into the remote world.&amp;nbsp; This sensor also has the ability to engage the public, bringing remote worlds back to earth.&amp;nbsp; During FY13, this task used science operations personnel from current SMD projects to objectively measure improvement in remote science target selection and decision-making based. The team continues to work with SMD projects to ensure that the technologies being developed are directly responsive to SMD project personnel needs. The objective of this work in FY14 is to expand the range of science operations tasks addressed by the technology, and to perform laboratory demonstrations for JPL/SMD stakeholders of the immersive visualization of data from a sensor using an SMD representative environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 2014, the &amp;ldquo;Controlling&lt;em&gt; Robots Over Time Delay&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; project element will develop two technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop RAPID robot messaging for unified cross-center operations platform for TDM, xGDS, and CCSDS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sensor Systems for the Construction of Immersive Virtual Environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
