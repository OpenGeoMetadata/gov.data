    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We were interested here in particular in conditions where un-modeled effects are present as manifested by the different degradation curve at 45Â°C. Although all algorithms were given the same amount of information to the degree practical, there were considerable differences in performance. Specifically, the combined Bayesian regression-estimation approach implemented as a RVM-PF framework has significant advantages over conventional methods of RUL estimation like ARIMA and EKF. ARIMA, being a purely data-driven method, does not incorporate any physics of the process into the computation, and hence ends up with wide uncertainty margins that make it unsuitable for long-term predictions. Additionally, it may not be possible to eliminate all non-stationarity from a dataset even after repeated differencing, thus adding to prediction inaccuracy. EKF, though robust against non-stationarity, suffers from the inability to accommodate un-modeled effects and can diverge quickly as shown. We did not explore other variations of the Kalman Filter that might provide better performance such as the unscented Kalman Filter. The Bayesian statistical approach, on the other hand, appears to be well suited to handle various sources of uncertainties since it defines probability distributions over both parameters and variables and integrates out the nuisance terms. Also, it does not simply provide a mean estimate of the time-to-failure; rather it generates a probability distribution over time that best encapsulates the uncertainties inherent in the system model and measurements and in the core concept of failure prediction.",
