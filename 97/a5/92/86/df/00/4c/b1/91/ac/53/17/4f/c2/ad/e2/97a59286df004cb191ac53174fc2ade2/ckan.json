These results are sufficient for developing inundation maps and/or an emergency action plan. However, due to limitations in the understanding of and ability to model flow dynamics of such severe, abrupt, and debris-laden breach waves, the modeling is approximate. The results must be, in turn, considered approximate. The nature and limitations of these predictions must be kept in mind when using these results. This dataset represents the watersurface during a dam breach event.",
