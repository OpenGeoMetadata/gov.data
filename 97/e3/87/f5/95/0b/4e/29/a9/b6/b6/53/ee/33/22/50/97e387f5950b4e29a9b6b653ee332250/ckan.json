    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Venus retains many secrets pertaining to its formation and evolution.  NASA is interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmosphere and surface of Venus through the use of long-lived balloons and landers.  Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets.  This Phase I proposal discloses technology that will permit operation and survivability in high-temperature/high-pressure planetary environments such as Venus.\r\nThe goal of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of a very high temperature thermal control system and to experimentally demonstrate a 1251 kJ/Kg thermal storage medium.\r\nThe successful completion of such an effort requires dramatic advances in technology, areas in which Mainstream has tremendous experience and has excelled in the past.  However, although no extremely high temperature heat rejection system has ever been fabricated anywhere in the world, this critical requirement is necessary to achieve long-life operation on Venus and other planets.  This effort represents a major leap over the current state of the art, and Mainstream is uniquely suited to perform this task.\r\n",
