    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "SynGenics Corporation proposes a program that unites mathematical and statistical processes, Response Surface Methodology, and multicriterial optimization methods to design optimized, failsafe technologies to control shockwave-boundary-layer interactions and realize improvements in supersonic inlet performance and vehicle efficiency. The innovation described in this proposal is the development of SynGenics Optimization System (SynOptSys), a software product that will provide expert guidance to the user in the capture and documentation of response variables, identification of factors, and statistical design of experiments (DOE).  Furthermore, the software system will assist the user in the analysis of DOE data, model building, diagnostics, and system optimization. The software will implement multicriteral optimization methods developed by SynGenics personnel, which will enable the simultaneous optimization of the flow-control (FC) system with respect to multiple, competing inlet-system requirements. SynOptSys will help designers and product developers overcome the barriers that prevent them from using powerful mathematical and statistical techniques to develop better products in a less costly manner. SynOptSys will implement the final task in a suite of methods developed by SynGenics to transform a need and candidate solution concepts to an affordable solution. Use of these powerful techniques enables the development of high-value systems. The significance of this program is that it will provide tools necessary to conduct multicriterial, inlet system-level-assessments and optimizations of enabling technologies, including, but not limited to flow-control technologies  This program supports the Propulsion Efficiency key research area of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Supersonics Program by working to develop inlet FC technologies that will facilitate low TSFC of highly integrated supersonic inlets and improved overall cruise efficiency through reduced inlet drag.",
