Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans. This shapefile identifies areas where lidar points have been classified as snow or where snow was thought to exist based on evaluation of bare-earth DEM's and intensity images.",
