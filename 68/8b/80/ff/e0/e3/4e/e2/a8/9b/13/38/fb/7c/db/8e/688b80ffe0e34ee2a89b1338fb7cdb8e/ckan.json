  "notes": "Federal facilities are properties owned by the federal government. This data layer provides access to Federal facilities that are Superfund sites as part of the CIMC web service. Data are collected using the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) and transferred to Envirofacts for access by the public. Data about Federal facility Superfund sites are located on their own EPA web pages, and CIMC links to those pages. Links to the relevant web pages for each site are provided within the attribute table. Federal facility sites can be either Superfund sites or RCRA Corrective Action sites, or they may have moved from one program to the other and back. In Cleanups in My Community, you can map or list any of these Federal Facility sites. This data layer shows only those facilities that are Superfund Sites. RCRA federal facility sites and other Superfund NPL sites are included in other data layers as part of this web service. Superfund is a program administered by the EPA to locate, investigate, and clean up worst hazardous waste sites throughout the United States. EPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governments. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills - the key word here being abandoned. The CIMC web service was initially published in 2013, but the data are updated on the 18th of each month. The full schedule for data updates in CIMC is located here: https://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/data_update_v2.",
