    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "<h2 class='newsdate'>Please note that the machine on which these AVHRR data are processed has reached its life expectancy and will no longer be available as of 02 June 2008 until further notice.</h2>\nNSIDC collects and archives 1.1 km High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Local Area Coverage (LAC) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Original data are from recorded and rebroadcast LAC images for both polar regions and from several HRPT receiving stations, including McMurdo, Palmer, Casey, Fairbanks, Prince Albert, and Tromso. NSIDC receives these data from a polar subset of the EROS Data Center (EDC) Global Land 1 km AVHRR Data Set and from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, which collects Antarctic HRPT data from the McMurdo and Palmer stations. NSIDC received LAC data for the Southern Hemisphere through 1998 from a University of Colorado Domestic Satellite (DOMSAT) receiver and from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Satellite Active Archive (SAA) after 1998. These sources provide nearly complete coverage of sea ice, land ice, and polar land in the north and south polar regions, at 1.1 km resolution for all five bands of the AVHRR sensor. Data extend from April 1992 through the present for the Southern Hemisphere, and from August 1993 through the present for the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nArchived scenes, browse imagery, and information on location, time of acquisition, image size, and data quality are available via the AVHRR Polar 1 Km Level 1B Data Set Product Web site.",
