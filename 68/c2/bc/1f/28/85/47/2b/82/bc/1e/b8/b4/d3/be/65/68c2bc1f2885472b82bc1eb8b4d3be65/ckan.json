The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is\n               designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Other Identifiers Relationship File contains\n               external identifier codes, such as National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) codes and individual county identifiers. The edge to which an Other Identifiers\n               Relationship File record applies can be determined by linking to the All Lines shapefile on the permanent edge identifier (TLID) attribute. Not every\n               TLID has an external identifier associated with it and some TLIDs may have more than one.",
