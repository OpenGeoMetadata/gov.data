    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important indicator of the state of the earth climate system as well as a key variable in the coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. Accurate knowledge of SST is essential for climate monitoring, prediction and research. It is also a key surface boundary condition for numerical weather prediction and for other atmospheric simulations using atmospheric general circulation models and regional models. SST also is important in gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, including the air-sea flux of carbon. Gridded SST products have been developed to satisfy these needs. There are 3 .zip files provided with this data set.Gridded monthly and weekly sea surface temperature (SST) and long term SST monthly climatology for the period 1971-2000 are provided here. Weekly normalized error variance fields are also provided with the weekly data. The data are derived using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation (OI) global sea surface temperature analyses that use seven days of in situ (ship and buoy) and satellite SST observations and SST values derived from sea ice concentration. These analyses are produced weekly using optimum interpolation (OI) on a 1-degree grid. The data sets included in the ISLSCP II data collection are produced using version 2 of the OI analyses, called OIv2. In this data set, the ISLSCP II staff have masked land areas based on the ISLSCP II land/water mask. A file describing the differences between the ISLSCP II mask and the original mask used is provided.",
