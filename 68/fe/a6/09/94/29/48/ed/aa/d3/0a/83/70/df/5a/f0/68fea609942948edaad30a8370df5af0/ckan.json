    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains chlorophyll concentration maps of the Amazon River floodplain region from Parintins (Amazonas) to Almeirim (Para). These chlorophyll fraction maps were derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (MOD09) for 19 months from April 2002 to December 2003. The study was conducted in a floodplain reach upstream from Santarem, Para, in order to assess seasonal changes in phytoplanktonic chlorophyll-a distributions in the floodplain Lake Curuai. MODIS reflectance data were acquired at four river stages: rising (April), high (June), decreasing (September), and low (November). Chlorophyll maps were derived and used to compute the weighted average of chlorophyll concentration from MODIS images in the region. Field measurements of suspended inorganic matter and chlorophyll-a in Lake Curuai were made almost concurrently with satellite overpasses (Barbosa, 2005). The images and the estimated chlorophyll concentrations were compared to measured chlorophyll concentrations at control points for different hydrological states. This data set may be applied to better understand the seasonal dynamics of primary production of the Amazon floodplains. The maps of chlorophyll-a concentration may be used to model spatial and temporal variations of primary production in this region.The monthly chlorophyll-a maps are provided as GeoTIFF files. There are two formats: (1) color-mapped pixels and (2) pixels as chlorophyll-a concentrations. These latter images are not intended for browsing. These images have pixel values that are the chlorophyll-a concentration in mg/m3 and need to be download and opened in GIS software.",
