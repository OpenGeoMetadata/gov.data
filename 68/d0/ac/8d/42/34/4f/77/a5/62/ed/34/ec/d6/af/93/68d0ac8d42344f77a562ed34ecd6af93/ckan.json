  "notes": "This layer conatains line data for the red sesbania (Sesbania punicea) database. The database represents historic and current observations by various individuals of occurrences of red sesbania, a non-native invasive plant that currently is invading riparian ecosystems in California. Most occurrences are in the Central Valley, but a few are in the San Francisco Bay area and in a few watersheds to the north. These data were compiled to aid in the eradication and control of the species where it is invasive, as well as to inform the public of its spread. As of February 1, 2006, there were 25 records of linear occurrences maintained in an Access database titled SesbaniaData. Each record represents a line, or linear scattered occurrence of red sesbania.",
