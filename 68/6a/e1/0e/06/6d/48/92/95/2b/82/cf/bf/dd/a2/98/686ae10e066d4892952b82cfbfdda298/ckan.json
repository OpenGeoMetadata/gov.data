  "notes": "Samples of water, benthic sediment, fish and interior least tern eggs, taken from various locations on the refuge between 1990-2001, indicate a relatively low risk of reproductive failure in aquatic birds due to selenium toxicity. Concurrent analysis of the water, sediment and fish samples for copper, revealed relatively high concentrations of this element in fish; but, still well below suggested guidelines for food-chain organisms. Fish from one watershed (Cottonwood Creek) stood out as having unusually high concentrations of both selenium and copper. The analysis of separate water, sediment, and forage fish samples, for a suite of 16-18 additional trace elements, showed that although concentrations of arsenic and zinc in fish were high in relation to the nationwide statistics reported by the National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program, they were below the dietary guidelines suggested for the protection of predators. A separate study, with two objectives, was aimed specifically at evaluating the impacts of confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) within the Salt Plains NWR watershed. With regard to the first objective, no significant differences in nutrient concentrations or Microtox (R) toxicity were found in stream water samples taken above and below existing swine and cattle CAFOs on Twin Spring Creek and the Salt Fork River, respectively. These facilities do not discharge directly into these streams, but it was hypothesized that perhaps a hydrologic link existed between the animal waste and the streams via a groundwater connection. The second objective of the CAFO study was to describe sediment nutrient concentrations and fish communities in all tributaries to Salt Plains NWR to be used as a baseline or benchmark for future evaluation. Because of the predominance of sand in all substrates, in-stream nutrient concentrations are uniformly low, and it is recommended that samples from depositional areas, near the confluence with Great Salt Plains Reservoir, be used for future nutrient comparisons. Three community metrics based on taxonomic richness, tolerance to water quality degradation, and trophic level status, were calculated for fish communities in each stream. Total scores indicated a rather wide range of conditions from the best (Sandy Creek) to the worst (Clay Creek).",
