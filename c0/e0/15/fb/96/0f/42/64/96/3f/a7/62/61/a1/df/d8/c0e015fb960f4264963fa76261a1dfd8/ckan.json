    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The design of an aircraft is a highly iterative process.  During the conceptual design phase there is no time for developing detailed simulation models and decisions are typically made either by using low fidelity models or existing data and regression models.  However, the decisions made during the conceptual design phase greatly affect the performance of the aircraft and the associated cost, and typically the majority of the cost is locked during very early stages of the design process.  Usually the sound insulation requirements of a passenger cabin are met after the outer mold line of the aircraft and the design of the fuselage structure have been completed and this approach adds weight to the design.  Ideally the structural-acoustic concerns should enter the design cycle early and be considered along with other main design disciplines.  During the early design stages of an aircraft the interior noise performance of different fuselage configurations must be evaluated based on the following information: length, cross sectional stations as a function of longitudinal location, main interior arrangements, spacing and size of stiffeners and stringers, thickness and material properties of insulation blankets, thickness and material properties of the fuselage and of the trim panels, and the type of acoustic treatment placed in the interior.  The acoustic performance expressed in terms of noise reduction comprises the metric for assessing the aircraft performance for interior noise considerations.   The proposed project will develop an easy to use, physics based, computational capability that can provide fast an assessment for the interior noise of either conventional or novel aircraft during the early stages of the design process.  It will also allow engaging information from multi-scale simulations for designing quiet composite materials with increased damping and reduced radiation efficiency characteristics.",
