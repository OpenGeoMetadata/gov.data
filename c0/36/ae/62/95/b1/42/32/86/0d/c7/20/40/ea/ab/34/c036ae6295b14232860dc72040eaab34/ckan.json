  "notes": "  Purpose: The Aircrew Accommodation Laboratory measures and assesses the compatibility of the human body with various aircraft environments, such as cockpits and workstations. The lab uses anthropometry, which is the study of human body measurements, to create or modify equipment to reduce the physical limitations and strains of aircrew.  Function:  The lab supports aircraft program offices, aircrew and passengers. It has the expertise and resources to provide NAVAIR Programs of Record with engineering endorsed risk reduction strategies and to support NAVAIR Lead Systems Integration efforts related to crew, maintainer accommodation and technology integration. The lab also supports ground and flight test events.  Capabilities:   Evaluations in actual aircrafts and in mock up lab setting Individual body measurements to estimate size of test subjects &amp;#8226;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Aircraft scanning and digitization Digital human modeling Anthropometric databases of personnel Anthropometric restriction assessments Anthropometric Restriction Codes Digitally preserved computer aided design Facility and aircraft system performance assessments support Accommodation trend lines and prediction equations Assessments of a percentage of a population compatible with given aircraft Overlay capabilities for redesign assessments  Unique Asset List:     Hardware/Tools  FaroArm coordinate measurement machines Konica Minolta Range 7 scanner Faro Laser Line Probe (scanner) Shapeshot System (3D photography/geometry) Anthropometers and measurement Calipers Crew Accommodation Geometric Evaluation System Strength and mobility testing equipment Library of engineering drawings for various USN/USMC aircraft Software  AnthroCAM (FaroArm software) Auto CAD Rhinoveros CAD/NURBS Modeling &amp;amp; Pointools Polyworks Modeling Range Viewer DDI Capture/Viewer (Shapeshot) Santos digital human modeling Established Protection of Human Subjects processes and standing Independent Review Board  ",
