    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optoelectronic integrated holds the key to higher performance, reduced mass and radiation-hard space systems.  A special need is increased flexibility of phased arrays for communication and detection. Currently RF arrays use ferrite waveguide elements for phase shifting which are both bulky and lossy with a phase shift limit of 360: . Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) arrays currently use a single optical source with mechanical steering. An identified goal would be an RF array with true time delay for beam steering and combined in the same physical location with an optical array steered via optical phase shift. ODIS approaches this problem with an optoelectronic circuit that integrates the RF and optical elements within a single chip. The RF at Ka band is generated by an optoelectronic oscillator and converted to RF power in a photodiode at the antenna element. The antenna element is a printed dipole on chip with dimensions of &amp;#955;/2 (&amp;#8776;4.3mm). The optical source is an array of vertical cavity lasers spaced sufficiently closely to achieve a coherent beam. Optical beam steering is achieved by optical phase shifting of the coherent beam. In this SBIR, ODIS will demonstrate the key components integration to achieve a common RF/optical aperture.",
