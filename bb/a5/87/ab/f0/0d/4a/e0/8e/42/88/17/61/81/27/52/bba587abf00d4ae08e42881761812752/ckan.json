  "notes": " The Center for Urban Environmental Research and Education (CUERE) at UMBC was created in 2001 with initial support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. US EPA has provided ongoing additional support since the initial start-up grant. CUERE&amp;#39;s mission is to advance the understanding of the environmental, social and economic consequences of the transformation of the urban landscape through research, conferences and symposia, support of university teaching programs and assistance to K-12 education. CUERE fosters interdisciplinary approaches to environmental science, engineering and public policy. The CUERE research team includes environmental engineers, scientists, and policy analysts. The center&amp;#39;s research agenda focuses on relationships among natural and socioeconomic processes that occur in urban environments and their impact on public policy. The center is equipped with meeting facilities; integrated analytical, educational and research laboratories; and state-of-the-art computer and geographic information systems. Research and education programs sponsored by CUERE provide a critical link for state and local governmental agencies to better assess and respond to urban environmental issues.  ",
