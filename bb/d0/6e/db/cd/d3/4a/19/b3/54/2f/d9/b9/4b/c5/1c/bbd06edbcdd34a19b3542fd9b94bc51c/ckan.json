    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Level 3AT data product consists of daily, 65.536 second interval time-ordered vertical profiles of temperature, geopotential height, concentrations of O3, H2O, CH3CN, ClO, HNO3, and SO2, as well as upper tropospheric humidity (UTH). The insrument measures in the microwave spectral region at frequencies of 63, 183 and 205 GHz. MLS was flown on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and designed to measure the chemical composition of the stratosphere and mesosphere, relationship between chlorine monoxide and ozone destruction. Limb measurements were made in the altitude range between 10 and 85 km at about 2.5 km resolution. Data were collected between latitude 34S and 80N and 80S and 34N, alternating each satellite yaw cycle of about 36 days. The MLS Level 3AT data were processed with the version 5 algorithm, except H2O which is version 6, and SO2 and UTH which are version 4.\n\nNote: H2O and O3 at 183 GHz data are available only through April 15, 1993 when\nthe 183 GHz radiometer failed.\n\nThe MLS level 3AT product consists of 10 granules per day. A data granule is one MLS species or subtype per day.  The following subtypes are available:\n\n\n 1) CH3CN - methyl cyanide            [vmr]\n 2) CLO - chlorine monoxide           [vmr]\n 3) H2O - water vapor                 [vmr]\n 4) HNO3 - nitric acid                [vmr]\n 5) O3_183 - ozone at 183 GHz         [vmr]\n 6) O3_205 - ozone at 205 GHz         [vmr]\n 7) SO2 - sulfur dioxide              [vmr]\n 8) GPH - geopotential height         [m]\n 9) TEMP - atmospheric temperature    [Kelvin]\n10) UTH - upper tropospheric humidity [%]\n\n*vmr = volume mixing ratio\n\nMLS data are on the UARS standard pressure levels (in mbars) given by:\n\nP(i) =  1000 * 10**(-i/6)  for i = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nEach of the 10 MLS granules is accompanied by an additional parameter file, designated as level 3TP.  The parameter file, contains the additional ancillary and quality information, as well as total column amounts not found in the 3AT files. The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.",
