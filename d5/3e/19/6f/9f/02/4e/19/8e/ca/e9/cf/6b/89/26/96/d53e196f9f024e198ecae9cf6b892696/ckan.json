  "notes": "This report represents the preliminary results of the second year of the multiyear study, The Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Complex) Environmental Contaminants Background Survey. The goal is to establish a baseline for future studies and to assist the managers in identifying potential impacts to fish and wildlife resources from environmental contaminants. Sediment and soil were sampled at three refuges of the Complex, Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Amagansett NWR, and Oyster Bay NWR, in 1991 and analyzed for inorganic and organic chemical residues. In addition, Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) eggs were collected from Wertheim NWR and field mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. Ieucopus) were collected from Amagansett NWR to assess inorganic and organic chemical burdens in wildlife. Sediment collected from Wertheim NWR in 1 991 had levels of lead, mercury, zinc, copper, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and manganese exceeding at least one of the concern levels reviewed. No polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concern levels were exceeded in any of the sediment samples from Wertheim NWR in 1991. A review of the analysis of the sediment samples collected from Wertheim in 1990 determined that the same inorganic residues were found to exceed the concern levels (Mann and Karwowski 1991). Sediment collected from Oyster Bay NWR in 1991 had levels of lead, copper, mercury, and zinc exceeding at least one of the concern levels reviewed. No PAH concern levels were exceeded in any of the sediment samples collected from Oyster Bay NWR in 1991. A review of the analysis of the sediment samples collected from Oyster Bay in 1990 determined that the same inorganic residues were found to exceed the concern levels as well as nickel, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, and silver (Mann and Karwowski 1991). The sediment samples collected in 1990 had contaminant burdens significantly higher than the 199 1 samples. These samples were collected closer to potential contaminant sources than the 1991 samples. Both of the Mute Swan eggs collected at Wertheim NWR exceeded the predator protection levels for chromium, 0.2,ug/g (Eisler 1986) and selenium, 0.5,ug/g (Walsh et al. 1977). The mice collected at Amagansett NWR exceeded the predator protection levels suggested for arsenic, 0.5,ug/g and selenium (Walsh et al. 1 977). The 1991 sediment sampling results at Wertheim NWR and Oyster Bay NWR confirmed the 1990 findings. There is a transport of contaminants onto these refuges. On Wertheim NWR, three areas can be considered depositional areas which indicate the maximum contamination on the refuge. The biological uptake of the contaminants discovered in the sediment at both refuges needs to be determined. Biological samples were collected at both refuges during the 1992 sampling seasons. The results of these samples will be reported on in a future report.",
