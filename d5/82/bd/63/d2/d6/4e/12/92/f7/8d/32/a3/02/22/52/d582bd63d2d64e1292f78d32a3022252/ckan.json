    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Configuring the 3D geometry and physics of large scale parallel physics simulations is increasingly complex.  Given the investment in time and effort to run these codes, it is crucial that setting up the simulation is done accurately and that rapid iterative cycles of reconfiguring are efficient.  During the execution step, learning the proper syntax of commands, getting environment variables correct, writing scripts for the various common batch scheduling systems, locating applications or libraries, and managing directories of files all accumulate to a challenging set of chores.  Thus, we propose the Visual Interfaces for Parallel Simulations (VIPS) project to research and develop tools to allow simulation developer to leverage state-of-the-art visualization tools by adding functionality to set up and remotely manage the execution of simulations in addition to viewing 3D output.  Transforming visualization application into science studios will result in integrated and intuitive environments, easily customized for the physics simulation.  Resulting VIPS Studios can assist users in choosing correct input and free them from the error-prone processes of hand-editing input files and scripts. They will also simplify remote resource organization by abstracting the idea of a scientific run and managing meta data.",
