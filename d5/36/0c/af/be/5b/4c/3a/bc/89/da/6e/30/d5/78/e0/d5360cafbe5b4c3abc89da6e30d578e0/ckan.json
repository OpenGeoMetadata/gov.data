  "notes": "This dataset was developed in an effort to compile Western Pond Turtle (Clemmys marmorata) observations in CDFG Region 1. Steve Burton (CDFG Staff Environmental Scientist) took the lead on the project by sending out an email request for Region 1 Staff to send him any anecdotal information they may have regarding pond turtles. He received approximately 65 anecdotal observations which were subsequently added to this GIS Layer. These anecdotal observations typically did not include observation dates, counts of individuals, or presence of juveniles. During the Summer of 2006, CDFG hired Cheryl Bondi through a contract with Humboldt State University to seek additional observations from other sources, to re-visit the anecdotal sites, and to visit likely sites to make additional observations. Cheryl compiled/reported an additional 277 observations in the database. To facilitate the reporting of Western Pond Turtle observations into a centralized database, the Region 1 Information Services Branch established an online Turtle Mapping tool which allows users to add observations via an ArcIMS Mapping tool. Region 1 Staff were directed to this application to report Pond Turtle Observations. This tool will continue to be available and the database is expected to continue growing. The basic reference data provided by the tool are the scanned 1:24k USGS Topographical Maps. As such, the expected accuracy of the observation locations are +/- 40 ft. Staff were additionally instructed to report sightings of Red-Eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) as well. These observations were only incidental to the collection of Western Pond Turtle observations. As of 4/10/2007, only 3 Red-Eared Slider observations were reported in the database. Note that this layer was compiled before Mendocino County became part of Region 1. As such, no efforts were made to compile Western Pond Turtle Observations for Mendocino County.",
