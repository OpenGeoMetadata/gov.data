  "notes": "Sections 305(b) and 314 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) require states, territories, and authorized tribes to provide biennial reports to EPA on the condition of waters within their boundaries. EPA regulations at 40 CFR 130.7 require states to provide biennial submissions of impaired waters lists. EPA provides guidance on these reports in a way that supports the Agency's strategy for achieving a broad-scale, national inventory of water quality conditions. The guidance is from EPA to states, territories, authorized tribes, and interstate commissions (\"jurisdictions\") to help states prepare and submit Section 305(b) reports to EPA. Use of the integrated report (IR) format provides jurisdictions a recommended reporting format and suggested content to be used in developing a single document that integrates the reporting requirements of Sections 303(d), 305(b), and 314. This format allows jurisdictions to report on the water quality standards attained for all waters, document the availability of data and information for each segment, identify certain trends in water quality conditions, and set priorities for protecting and restoring the health of the nation's aquatic resources. Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act requires each state to conduct water quality surveys to determine a water body's overall health, including whether or not basic uses are being met. States, tribes, and other jurisdictions define appropriate uses for a waterbody and incorporate these uses into water quality standards that are approved by EPA. Water body uses include aquatic life protection, fish and shellfish production, drinking water supply, swimming, boating, fishing, and agricultural irrigation, among others.",
