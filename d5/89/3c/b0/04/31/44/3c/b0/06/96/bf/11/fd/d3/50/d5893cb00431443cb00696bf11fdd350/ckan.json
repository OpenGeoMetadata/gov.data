  "notes": " This laboratory is a 40 by 28 by 9 foot facility that is equipped with tools for the development of various items of control technology related to the transmission of electrical energy to the human body, as well as items of control technology to serve as warning or protective systems for the control of the transmission of mechanical energy to the human body. In addition, this laboratory includes various sensor-system development tools for developing biomedical instrumentation for workplace hazard exposures and work stressors. Test equipment includes digitizing oscilloscopes, RF phase generators, function generators, digital multimeters, computer workstations and various other items of test equipment for the generation, analysis and modification of items of electronic control technology. The laboratory is also used to develop electronic circuits and sensors to support in-house human subject studies. Current products developed from this laboratory include an EMG-video timecode synchronization unit, ROPS activation sensors, and electronic circuitry for detecting capacitance differential between wood products and humans in the signal path.
