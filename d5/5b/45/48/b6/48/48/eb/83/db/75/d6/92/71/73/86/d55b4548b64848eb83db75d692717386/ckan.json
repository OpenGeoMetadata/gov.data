  "notes": "The Transuranic Processing Facility (7920) , along with the Thorium-U Recycle Facility (7930). comprise the Radiochemical Engineering Developmen Complex. 7920 is designed to contain and provide shielding for all types of high-level radioactive materials, including gamma, beta, alpha, and neutron emitters. The equipment in the hot cell cubicles can be operated and maintained entirely by remote handling methods. The equipment is modular and can be replaced, upgraded, or reconfigured remotely. 7920 is the production, storage, and distribution center for the DOE heavy element research program, which separates and purifies elements from plutonium through fermium. 7920 has nine heavily shielded hot cells that contain equipment for high-radiation-level radiochemical processing equipment, analytical chemistry operations, and target fabrication activities, with a 50-ton bridge crane to service the cells and handle heavy equipment and casks. There are also eight laboratories, including two shielded caves, that are used for final product purification and packaging, process control analyses, and process development work. The facility also contains a solvent extraction test facility in cell 5 and cubicle 5 containing equipment designed to perform irradiated reactor fuel reprocessing tests. There is also a transfer and decontamination facility to serve as the interface between the cell bank and shipping carriers. It also serves as the terminus for the pneumatic transfer between the Transuranic Processing Facility and Thorium-Uranium Recycle Facility for transfer of californium packages.The facility utilizes vessel off-gas and cell off-gas systems vented through a common stack shared by Transuranic Processing Facility, Thorium-Uranium Recycle Facility, and HFIR.
