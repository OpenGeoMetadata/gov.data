    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing need to fly Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) to perform missions of vital importance to national security and defense, emergency management, science, and to enable commercial applications. However, routine access by UAS to the NAS remains unrealized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UAS community needs routine access to the global airspace for all classes of UAS. Based on this need, NASA&amp;#39;s UAS Integration in the NAS Project identified the following goal: To provide research findings to reduce technical barriers associated with integrating UAS into the NAS utilizing integrated system level tests in a relevant environment. These barriers include: a lack of sense-and-avoid concepts and technologies that can operate within the NAS, robust communication technologies, robust human systems integration, and a relevant environment for use in testing the developed technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project&amp;#39;s goal will be accomplished by developing system-level integration of key concepts, technologies and/or procedures, as well as demonstrating those integrated capabilities in an operationally relevant environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project conducts research to address technical&amp;nbsp;barriers in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense and Avoid (SAA) [synonymous with Detect and Avoid (DAA)] Performance Standards: Provide research findings to develop and validate UAS Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for SAA performance and interoperability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Command and Control (C2) Performance Standards: Provide research findings to develop and validate UAS MOPS for terrestrial C2 communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human Systems Integration (HSI): Provide research findings to develop and validate HSI ground control station (GCS) guidelines enabling implementation of the SAA and C2 performance standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&amp;amp;E): Develop a relevant test environment that is a live virtual constructive (LVC) distributed environment (DE), for use in generating research findings to develop and validate HSI guidelines, DAA, and C2 MOPS with test scenarios supporting integration of UAS into the NAS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These activities support research within the aeronautics strategic thrust area 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
