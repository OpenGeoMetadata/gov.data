  "notes": "This study provides baseline data on contaminant concentrations in three eider species from coastal areas of western and northern Alaska and arctic Russia. Substantial declines in Alaskan-breeding populations of the spectacled (Somateria fischeri) and Steller's eiders (Polysticta stelleri), have gone largely unexplained and have raised concerns about contaminant exposures on breeding grounds and in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. Of the 78 eida carcasses we acquired, 51 were common eiders (Somateria mollissima), 18 were spectacled eiders and 7 were Steller's eiders. Given that many arctic and subarctic marine organisms have been found with notable concentrations of organochlorines in their tissues, we were surprised to find minimal concentrations in these eiders from Alaska and arctic Russia. As for the elemental residues, aluminum, barium, beryllium, boron, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, strontium, vanadium and zinc residues were found at levels that were biologically essential or were far below concentrations believed to cause harmful effects in birds and thus are not discussed. The remaining analytes (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury and selenium) are discussed either because they are known to be toxic at relatively low concentrations or because they were found at concentrations warranting further review. The data suggest that cadmium was elevated in some spectacled eiders, copper was elevated in common and spectacled eiders, lead was elevated in a few eiders believed to have ingested lead shot and selenium was highly elevated in spectacled eiders. It is not clear, however, why concentrations were elevated in these birds or how widespread the contamination is in their populations. Furthermore, we do not know whether these elevated concentrations represent an increase in risk to eider populations. Results from this report, however, will help to focus future studies involving contaminants and routes of exposure.",
