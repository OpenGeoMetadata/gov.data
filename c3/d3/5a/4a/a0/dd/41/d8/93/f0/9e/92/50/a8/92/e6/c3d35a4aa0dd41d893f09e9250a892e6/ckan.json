    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Reliable energy systems with high energy density capable of operating at high temperatures, pressures and radiation levels are needed for certain NASA missions. Batteries based on solid-state ceramic oxide composite electrolytes provide the benefit of operation at temperatures up to 550o C.  The current high-temperature Li battery technologies use carbonate, chloride and other molten compounds based electrolytes within porous separators. The operating temperatures of these systems are limited to below 450o C due to reactivity of these electrolytes with electrode materials and issues associated with sealing and packaging such batteries systems. Solid state electrolyte based batteries can be packaged to be leak proof  under extreme conditions as there are no liquid components involved. Ceramatec Inc. is proposing to develop LiAl-solid electrolyte-FeS2 battery system based on co-pressed and laminated electrode-electrolyte structures. The Li ion conductivity of the solid electrolytes developed at Ceramatec approaches 10-1 S/cm at 400o C, and are chemically compatible with the selected electrode materials.  These batteries can be developed as either primary or secondary battery systems for use at temperatures above 400o C. In our Phase I SBIR program, single cells will be fabricated and their specific energy, cyclability and rate capability will be evaluated. ",
