  "notes": "Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255. This dataset is a combination of all DOQ images from the State of Arkansas. They have been stitched into a single mosaic through an automated process using ER Mapper software from Earth Resource Mapping Pty Ltd. The DOQ images were contrast balanced (using histogram matching) and the resulting balanced mosaic was forced into a value range of 0 to 255 using a simple linear transformation.",
