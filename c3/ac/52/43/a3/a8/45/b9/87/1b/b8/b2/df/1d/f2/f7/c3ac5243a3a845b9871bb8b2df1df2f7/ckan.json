  "notes": "Benthic habitat maps of the nearshore marine environment of Pamyra Atoll were created by visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery. The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii (ALH), was to provide spatially-explicit information on the habitat types, biological cover and live coral cover of Palmyra Atoll's coral reef ecosystem. 0.61m panchromatic and 2.44m multi-spectral data from the QuickBird 2 satellite sensor were purchased for the mapping area. Photo-interpreters accurately and reliably delineated boundaries of features from this QuickBird 2 imagery as they appeared on the computer monitor using a software interface.",
