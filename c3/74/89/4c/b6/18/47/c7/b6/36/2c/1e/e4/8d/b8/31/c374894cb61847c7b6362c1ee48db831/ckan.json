  "notes": "This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant recharge value for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Beaver-North Canadian River from the panhandle to Canton Lake in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 830 square miles of the Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer consists of poorly sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz sand with minor amounts of clay, silt, and basal gravel. The hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits unconformably overlie the Tertiary-age Ogallala Formation and Permian-age formations. A recharge rate of 1 inch per year was estimated in the ground-water modeling report for the alluvial and terrace deposits and used in this data set. The recharge rate was estimated using a base-flow method and a monthly-water-balance method. The features in the data set representing boundaries along geological contacts were extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set based on a scale of 1:250,000. The geographic limits of the aquifer were digitized from a folded paper map, at a scale of 1:250,000 in the ground-water modeling report. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

Lines defining the geographic limits of the aquifer were digitized from a folded paper map (30 inches by 22 inches), at a scale of 1:250,000, from Davis and Christenson (1981). The maximum root-mean-square-error (RMSE) was 0.017 map inches (0.043 map centimeters) or 354.0 feet (107.90 meters) ground distance. Recharge polygons represented at these scales are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
