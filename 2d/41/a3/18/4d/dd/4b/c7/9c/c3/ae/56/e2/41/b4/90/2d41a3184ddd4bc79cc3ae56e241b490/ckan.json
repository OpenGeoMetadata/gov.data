  "notes": "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Road Inventory include location, road classification, road condition, sign information, date of visit and additional information. In a phased 5 year project Pacific Western Technologies, a contractor for the U.S. Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration conducted surveys of roads and associated road features on National Wildlife Refuges and other properties managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Road conditions were noted and locations collected with Trimble GPS receivers. This data set consists of line segments between identified feature locations. Road Inventory Reports are available at http://resourcegis.org/egis/ds/reportsearch.aspx for each Refuge or Fish Hatchery. The user can search for the roads report of an individual Refuge or Fish Hatchery to better understand this data set. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Information Resource and Technology Management removed all cost related information and detailed condition information from this dataset, and added the Refuge or Fish Hatchery name. Road segments outside of the boundaries of lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were deleted from this data set.",
