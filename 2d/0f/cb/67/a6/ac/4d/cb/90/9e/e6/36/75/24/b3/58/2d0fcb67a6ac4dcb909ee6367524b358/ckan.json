    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hydrogen is an essential resource for space missions. NASA has a need\nfor equipment to generate, handle and store hydrogen. In terms of\nhandling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and\ncompressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability.\nElectrochemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any\nmoving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. Sustainable\nInnovations has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using\nelectrochemical cell hardware. However, for high flow applications, such\nas a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for NASA, a departure from traditional\nelectrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. The proposed Expandable\nModular Architecture cell design, allows a large variable footprint for\nthe electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to\ncreate large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to\nmanufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active\narea cells.  The proposed Phase I activity will demonstrate a single\ncell Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump &amp;amp; Compressor (EHPC) using the EMA\ndesign to validate the modularity of the cell components. The ability to\nstack large active area cells will also be demonstrated with a four cell\nEHPC. For both pieces of cell hardware, cycling a pneumatic device will\nbe demonstrated. A manufacturing study will also be undertaken to\nvalidate the compatibility of the EMA design with cost reduction\npathways. This will facilitate establishing the design criteria for a\n3-4 CFM  1,000 psi EHPC to be constructed on Phase II",
