    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tCurrent electronic packaging designs used in our most recent spacecraft are comprised of technologies from the 1980&amp;rsquo;s and 1990&amp;rsquo;s. The current approach to electronic packaging design and selection uses well known design solutions because they are considered low risk and have space flight heritage; typically a ruggedized VME (Versatile Mechanical Euro) packaging architectures. Semiconductor features of this vintage utilize features that are measured in microns. As semiconductors have advanced, features are now measured in nanometers. We can use the example of the iPhone; with our current electronics design approaches the iPhone would be the size of a breadbox. These modern phones and devices such as laptop computers incorporate hundreds of new packaging technologies, some of which are appropriate for spaceflight and some that are not robust enough. The challenge is to identify the most useful technologies that are likely to survive rigorous spacecraft testing. With the exception of some earth-orbiting missions, virtually all other missions have unique environmental survival requirements. The primary objective of the Workshop will be to identify industry established state-of-the-art packaging technologies that can be leveraged without technology development with a focus on miniaturization. This will include active and passive components, substrates, connectors etc. Reliability and reworkability will be considered but will be a secondary objective in order to allow creativity. There will be a review of current JPL electronic packaging subsystems that can be exploited by reverse engineering the existing design. Also, new in-process JPL designs will be considered for redesign.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
