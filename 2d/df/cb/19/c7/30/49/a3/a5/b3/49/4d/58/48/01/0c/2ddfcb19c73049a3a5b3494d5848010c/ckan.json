    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project proposes to develop/demonstrate higher strength, low print-through, low mass, discrete core joint design and analysis method for large, lightweight, thermally-stable, composite sub-mm reflectors. Two SMLS reflector demonstrators delivered by Vanguard to JPL were optimized for thermal stability and specific stiffness. The full aperture was divided into three zones where core slots are aligned approximately perpendicular to the reflector skin. This approach was defined and selected based on: 1) a baseline core module; 2) CTE test data indicates the core laminate is anisotropic; and 3) the desire to reduce temperature induced astigmatism by use of alternating core slots. Discrete ribs were bonded up to +/-30? from the front facesheet. The project will evaluate and mature the SMLS design for NASA and JPL. Design modifications will be identified and demonstrated to preserve/improve the previously demonstrated thermal stability and stiffness.\r\nLightweight, thermally stable, low-cost laminate designs, adhesive materials, and manufacturing methods are required to adequately strengthen rib-to-facesheet butt joints and redistribute local rib-to-facesheet loads. To minimize impact to existing SMLS' demonstration reflector mass and thermal stability, development of a novel, supplementary modular rib/clip and joining method is envisioned.  \r\nThe proposed approach will require finite element analyses, design activities, coupon tests, and model-to-test data correlation. Analyses will include modal, acoustic response, and strength evaluation. Potential mass reduction opportunities will be identified.  Existing coupon failure modes will be evaluated and lessons learned applied to enhanced strength joint concepts. Previous demonstration reflector thermal distortion test results and correlation activities will be reviewed to reduce model uncertainty and evaluate the influence of the several types of rib/clip joints on figure change due to temperature soak.",
