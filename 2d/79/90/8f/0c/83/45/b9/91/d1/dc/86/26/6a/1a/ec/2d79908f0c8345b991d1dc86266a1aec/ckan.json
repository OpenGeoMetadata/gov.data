  "notes": " The Nuclear Computational Laboratory  supports graduate research in the development and application of computational techniques, simulation and modeling. Nuclear engineering has always relied on extensive computation for reactor and weapons design, and modeling of radiation transport, shielding, criticality, nuclear system dynamics and control, thermodynamics, heat transfer, hydrodynamics, fluid flow, interpretation of nuclear experiments (e.g., spectrum deconvolution), environmental transport of nuclear contaminants, radiation chemistry, fuel depletion and fission product buildup, and so on. Computation is playing an increasing role in physics and chemistry as well. New areas are strictly computational, such as digital image processing and reconstruction. The lab supports work in these disciplines. Current research projects include development of radiation transport methods, particle and fluid simulation of plasmas, modeling of fallout cloud rise, and quantum chemistry simulations for materials science. Software tools include Mathematica, AutoCAD, Devguide, and MCNP(x) (Monte Carlo N Particle (positron), TCAD (SYNOSPSIS) and C and Fortran development environments, as well as codes developed in our research.  The nuclear computation suite also includes a SECRET (RD) computation facility with the capability of conducting classified (SEC(RD)) analyses of nuclear effects and materials. The computational facility is housed within the classified computational suite, which includes a classroom, breakout room and separate research rooms with interconnected computers. The facility is classified for open storage, and has SIPR access and separate classified storage containers and 24 hour access by authorized personnel.  ",
