  "notes": "Baca National Wildlife Refuge was established in the arid San Luis Valley of south central Colorado in 2000. Intermittently to seasonally flooded meadows dominated by Baltic rush and sedges cover about 13% of the 37,500-ha (93,000-ac) refuge and may compose one of the most biologically significant resources in the region. For the past century, the meadows mostly have been managed by flood-irrigation in spring followed by hay harvest in late summer then grazing during fall and early winter. The current condition and wildlife use of meadows should be documented to help assess the appropriateness of this traditional management for supporting the refugeâ€™s proposed mission of conserving habitat for native biota especially migratory birds. Coinciding changes in surface water area, general structure and composition of vegetation, and occurrence of breeding species of migratory birds were measured on 140 3.1-ha (7.8-ac) circular plots distributed randomly across meadows during late spring through early summer 2008. The assessment was intended principally as an inventory and in most cases did not incorporate replication needed for formal statistical comparisons. Thus, descriptive statistics and principle components analyses (PCA) were main tools used for summarizing data and conclusions generally were tentative.  A critical gap in knowledge is the value of large areas of flooded meadow that  in the previous year were either idle or were fall-grazed but not hayed.  Few such areas were available for this assessment and may pose opportunities for enhancing the habitat and species diversity of birds.  A more finely scaled, information-theoretic assessment that includes multiple management approaches across representative years of spring runoff seems warranted.  Regardless, approaches considered should account for control of introduced plant species and direct and indirect influences of historic ecosystem processes on native plant diversity.",
