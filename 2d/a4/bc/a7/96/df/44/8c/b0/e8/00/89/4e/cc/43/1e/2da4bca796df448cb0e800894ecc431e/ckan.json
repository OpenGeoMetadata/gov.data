  "notes": "This is one of several important historical documents associated with remediation activities at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge was once of 13 nuclear weapons production facilities in the United States during the Cold War and was managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The plant operated from 1952 to 1994 with manufacturing activities taking place in the center portion of the site with a large buffer zone around the area. In 1989, nuclear production work stopped to address environmental and safety concerns. Although work resumed in 1990, the mission was terminated when President George H. W. Bush canceled the W-88 Trident Warhead program in 1992. Nuclear and nonnuclear production stopped in 1993, and in 1994 the last shipment of defense-related materials was sent off-site.When the facility’s mission changed from production to cleanup and closure, it was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). The site was added to the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List (Superfund List) in 1989. With oversight from the EPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE), the DOE completed the $7 billion dollar cleanup in 2005. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 (Pub.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1379, enacted December 8, 2001), mandated that once remediation was complete the site would become a national wildlife refuge.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) policy requires a Level III Preacquisition Survey when it is determined, on the basis of the Level I or II Survey, that there is a reasonable basis to assume that hazardous substances were present on the real property or that there were effects of such hazardous substances present at the site, and extensive work (e.g. \"significant\" sampling and original research) is required to determine the extent of any hazardous substance, obtain an estimate of the remediation or other cleanup costs, and determine whether reprogramming is required. Although no formal Level I or II Surveys were conducted at the RFETS, the history of the site, coupled with evidence of contamination revealed during extensive DOE and contractor sampling, before and during the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), provided reasonable basis to conduct a Modified Level III Survey.This report concludes that the review of the data collected by DOE and their contractors and stored in the RI-ready database showed that the database used for the Remedial Investigation was of adequate quality to make determinations on the clean up process and the comprehensive risk assessment. The Service was included in the comprehensive risk assessment workgroup and was presented the opportunity, along with the EPA and CDPHE to comment on the development and assumptions used in the risk assessment. The comprehensive risk assessment was conservative enough in its assumptions that clean up work that was completed by DOE and its contractor, for all receptors at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, are protective of human health and the environment in the Peripheral OU. Supplementary/confirmatory sampling done by Service personnel supported the database used by DOE and its contractor and the comprehensive risk assessment. Service sampling results were, although not always at or below background levels, well within the range of results that DOE presented in their RI-ready database.The refuge was officially established in 2007.",
