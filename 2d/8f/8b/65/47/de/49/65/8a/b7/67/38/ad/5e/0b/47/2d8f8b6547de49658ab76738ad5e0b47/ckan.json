  "notes": " FUNCTION: Measures ship acoustic signatures in shallow water channels and at port entrances for detection and identification purposes. The system is the acoustics component of NRL&amp;#39;s Modular Sensor System (MSS), which is designed to provide track information and local identification of vessels as they approach U.S. ports. DESCRIPTION: The system is composed of two components, a buoy with two acoustic barrier lines and a monitoring system on shore. The acoustic lines contain hydrophones to form a barrier stretching out from the central buoy. The buoy is solar powered but also contains a rechargeable battery pack capable of running the buoy for 1 to 2 weeks; this is inside the central well along with the buoy&amp;#39;s electronics. The monitoring system is composed of a computer. Communications are by Ethernet-link radio. The system is composed totally of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components with the exception of the NRL-developed array interface electronics. The buoy system is capable of fully independent operation, including detection and acoustic data acquisition of passing ships. More frequently, the onshore monitoring system cues the buoy to acquire data based on information passed to it from the MSS. The hydrophone sensitivities, A/D gains, channel selection, sampling rate, and data acquisition period are all remotely programmable. INSTRUMENTATION: The COTS buoy includes a radar reflector and has an omnidirectional antenna and a self-powered strobe mounted on top. It is two-point moored to prevent twisting the acoustic lines. The lines are each 1 km long and have six hydrophones each. Inside the buoy&amp;#39;s central well are power management, array interface, and A/D data acquisition electronics, a computer with a solid-state drive, an Ethernet-link radio, and the battery pack. The monitoring system is composed of a computer, a radio, and a directional antenna.  ",
