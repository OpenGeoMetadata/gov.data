  "notes": "This data set is a digital general soil association map developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and non soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographic ally shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. These data are certified as a part of the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data base. The original mapping scale was 1: 250,000.",

      "value": "[\"Use Constraints: The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. STATSGO was designed primarily for regional, multi county, river basin, State, and multi state resource planning, management, and monitoring. STATSGO data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Soil Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Soil Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs. When STATSGO data are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the STATSGO map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the STATSGO map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components. The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Attribute data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
