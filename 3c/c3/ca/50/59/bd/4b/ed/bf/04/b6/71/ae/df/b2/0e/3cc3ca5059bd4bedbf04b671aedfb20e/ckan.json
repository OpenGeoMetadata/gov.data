    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides (1) areal estimates of deforestation events (>25 ha) that were identified from 2001-2004 in Mato Grosso by the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) as part of the Program for the Estimation of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon (PRODES) and (2) the classification of the post-deforestation land use as either cropland, cattle pasture, or not in production (deforested areas that were never fully cleared or returned immediately to secondary forest) in the years after the large deforestation events from 2002-2005. Data are provided in ESRI shapefile format. There are five compressed (*.zip) data files with this data set. Each shapefile represents one year of post-deforestation land use. Land use in the years following deforestation was estimated using annual time series of MODIS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index). Metrics of vegetation phenology derived annual time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI data were analyzed using a decision-tree classifier to characterize the major cover type in each area of new deforestation. Post-deforestation land use for each large deforestation event was classified based on the classification of MODIS phenology metrics for all years following deforestation during 2002-2005. ",
