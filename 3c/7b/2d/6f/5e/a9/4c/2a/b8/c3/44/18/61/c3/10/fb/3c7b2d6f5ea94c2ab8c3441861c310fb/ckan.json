    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The state-of-the-art material system for high-performance radiation-cooled liquid rocket engines is iridium/rhenium manufactured by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). As it has been produced for the past several years, Ultramet's CVD rhenium has a yield strength of 43 ksi and an elongation of 19&#37;, which makes it very attractive for propulsion applications. For high-pressure applications, however, even higher yield strength, especially at elevated temperature, is desirable. To address this need, Ultramet will build upon its recent success in alloy deposition techniques. By adding easy-to-deposit alloying agents to niobium and tantalum, room temperature yield strengths were increased from 19 ksi to 69 ksi for niobium, and from 37 ksi to 98 ksi for tantalum, while still maintaining excellent ductility. At elevated temperatures, the latter alloy's yield strengths were 26 ksi at 1600&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C and 15 ksi at 1800&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C, which compare quite favorably to rhenium's 19 and 11 ksi at the same temperatures. In this project, a similar alloying approach will be taken with rhenium to increase its yield strength, at both ambient and elevated temperatures. Increases in the rhenium yield strength will decrease the required wall thickness and hence reduce both the weight and cost of the combustion chamber. In addition to developing and characterizing novel rhenium-based alloys, the resulting properties will be used to modify the design of the 100-lbf Ir/Re flight chambers currently manufactured by Ultramet. The cost and weight savings afforded by using the new alloy in these bipropellant engines will be calculated. Designs will also be generated for a high-pressure 100-lbf chamber for NTO/MMH and a high-pressure 5-lbf chamber for use with the advanced, non-toxic monopropellant AF-315e. This latter chamber will be fabricated using the oxide-lined iridium/rhenium architecture, but the rhenium will be replaced with the higher-yield-strength alloy selected earlier.",
