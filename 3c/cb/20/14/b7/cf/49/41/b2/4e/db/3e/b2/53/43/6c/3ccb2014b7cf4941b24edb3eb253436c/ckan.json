    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The use of multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) techniques for complex fluid/structure interaction phenomena is increasing as proven numerical and visualization algorithms and high performance computing (HPC) platforms become more prevalent.  Parallel solution methodologies and networked computing clusters are readily available, yet the challenge of bringing highly sophisticated MDA research algorithms into a fast-paced NASA engineering environment still remains.  In particular, if the time accurate solution of fluid and thermal structural responses becomes practical, then significant improvements in the analysis of modern rocket engine combustion chambers and other space transportation subsystems will be achieved.  Continued improvements in current research tools and further validation of physical models are needed to develop practical MDA capabilities within the growing multidisciplinary engineering community.  Our research will produce an innovative MDA system based on an existing multi-physics code (CHEM) to compute the turbulent, chemically reacting flow and coupled structural heating of given configurations.  Our unique approach, involving solution adaptive algorithms on generalized unstructured grids, will provide NASA with an important capability to solve fluid/structure interaction problems in a collaborative engineering environment.  Furthermore, our hands-on experience with complex MDA problems will help ensure that the research product will offer NASA a significantly improved, commercially viable analysis tool.",
