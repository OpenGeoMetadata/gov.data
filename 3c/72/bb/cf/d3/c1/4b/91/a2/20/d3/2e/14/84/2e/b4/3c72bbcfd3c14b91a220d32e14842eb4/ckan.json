    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains 5-minute land use maps for agricultural activity in Amazonia. The data set was produced by the statistical fusion of agricultural census data from Brazil,Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru with the land cover data product from the Global Land Cover Facility. These land use maps indicate the estimated total amount of cropland and pasture (natural and planted) for the Amazon and Tocantins River basins in 1995 and 1980 and are suitable for use in models or other similar purposes. Data are provided in the netCDF format and the ARC/INFO GRID ASCII format.The 1995 data were generated from a fusion of agricultural census data and a satellite classification, and are described in Cardille, Foley, and Costa (2002).  The fusion technique merges agricultural census data from Brazil, Columbia, Peru, and Bolivia with land cover data from the University of Maryland Global Land Cover Facility 1-km classification. This technique was used to derive an estimate of the mid-1990s total agriculture surface for the region, which was then apportioned according to agriculture census data into cultivated area, natural pasture, and planted pasture.The 1980 maps, including only the Brazilian portion of the Amazon/Tocantins river drainage basins, were created by scaling the mid-1990s snapshots backward in time using the relative increase or decrease in agriculture, as derived from mid-1980s census data and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data (Cardille and Foley, 2003).",
