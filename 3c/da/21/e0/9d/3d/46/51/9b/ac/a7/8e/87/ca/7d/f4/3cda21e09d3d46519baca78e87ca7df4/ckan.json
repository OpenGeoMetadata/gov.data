    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;We define a&amp;nbsp;habitat fairly broadly to include any enclosed space that is intended to house people&amp;nbsp;for an extended period of time away from the Earth. Examples of habitats could include a crewed&amp;nbsp;base on the surface of an extraterrestrial planet, moon, or asteroid, a deep-space habitable enclosure, or an orbiting outpost such as the International Space Station. As crewed spacecraft&amp;nbsp;are sent farther from Earth and support more diverse human spaceflight missions, NASA will&amp;nbsp;require more advanced software, both in the flight control room and on board vehicles, to&amp;nbsp;automate many of the functions that are currently performed by ground-based flight controllers.&amp;nbsp;Speed of light delays and communications blackouts make it impossible for flight controllers on&amp;nbsp;Earth to operate the critical systems on distant habitats in real time, and the crew will not have&amp;nbsp;enough time available for many habitat operations tasks, so automation will be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the International Space Station is controlled remotely by a large team of experts in Houston. Keeping a large team of experts in the Mission Control Center is expensive; the Habitat Automation Project Element seeks to reduce this cost through automation, enabling a smaller team of people to control future missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For future missions to distant destinations such as Mars, there will be speed-of-light communication delays of up to 22 minutes each way, which will require the astronauts to make more decisions without the assistance of people on Earth, especially when responding to failures.&amp;nbsp;The Habitat Automation&amp;nbsp;Project Element is developing technology to help the astronauts make these deci&amp;shy;sions, including integrated systems health manage&amp;shy;ment software to automatically detect and diagnose spacecraft or system failures, and software to automatically plan sequences of actions to accomplish mission goals.&lt;/p&gt;",
