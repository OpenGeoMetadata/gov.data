    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains two ASCII text files, one providing productivity measurements for a chalk grassland on Beacon Hill, West Sussex, U.K. (50.92 N, -0.85 W) and the other containing climate data from a weather station at the former King's College London, Rogate Field Centre, 6 km distant (51.01 N, -0.85 W). Measurements of above-ground live biomass and total dead matter were made by harvesting 0.25-m2 quadrats in the 20 x 20-m study area at eight to ten week intervals from March 1972 to April 1973. Precipitation amount and minimum/maximum temperature were recorded from 1969 through 1993.Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was estimated by several methods: 332 g/m2/year (annual increase in living biomass, sum of species); 355 g/m2/year (peak or maximum live biomass, plant dry matter weight); 773 g/m2/year (maximum live + dead biomass); 310 g/m2/year (annual increase in living biomass carbon by summing positive increments in biomass); and 691 g/m2/year (annual net production accounting for leaf turnover). The carbon content of ANPP (accounting for leaf turnover) was estimated to be 310 gC/m2/year using a conversion factor of 0.45. Below-ground production was not measured.Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally published in 1998. ",
