    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains images of fractional cover estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) canopy, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and exposed soils (S) derived from Landsat images (30-m resolution) obtained for two ranches in the Brazilian Amazon from 1996 to 2002. The Fazenda Vitoria ranch is located in eastern Para near the city of Paragominas and is a mosaic of primary forest, logged forest, secondary forest, and pasture with moderately dissected topography. The Fazenda Nova Vida ranch is located in the state of Rondonia in western Amazonia and is a mosaic of primary forest, logged forest, and pastures. For Fazenda Vitoria, two dry-season Landsat images were obtained, subset, and analyzed. For Nova Vida three dry-season images and one end-of-wet-season image were obtained, subset, and analyzed. Spectral mixture analysis, which decomposes individual satellite pixels into constituent cover fractions of surface materials, was used with a general probabilistic modeling approach to derive subpixel cover fractions of PV, NPV, and S. There are six GeoTIFF (.tif) files with this data set.  ",
