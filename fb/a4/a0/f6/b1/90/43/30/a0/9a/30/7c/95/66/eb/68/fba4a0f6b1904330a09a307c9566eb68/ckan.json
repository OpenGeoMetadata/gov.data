  "notes": "This image represents a 1x1 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico (in NAD83 UTM 19 North). The backscatter values are in relative 8-bit (0 Â– 255) numbers, since the SoNAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) sensor was not calibrated. Different benthic habitat types were delineated and classified from this backscatter image. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office and other territory and federal partners, acquired interferometric backscatter and bathymetry data in Puerto Rico from 04/07/2009 to 04/21/2009. Data were acquired with a pole-mounted Teledyne Benthos C3D-LPM interferometric SoNAR (200 kHz) and processed using CARIS HIPS and SIPS v7.0 software. The backscatter data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using the Geocoder module in Hypack 2009. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.",
