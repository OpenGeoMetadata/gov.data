    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We intend to develop the technology for lightweight composite structure\nsuitable for both cryogenic fuel depot storage as well as human in-space\nhabitat.  These will incorporate improved impact technologies for\nmicro-meteor/space debris protection and radiation capable composite\ntechnologies.   The application of filament wound composite pressure\nvessels to uses requiring pressurized storage at cryogenic temperatures\nhas been undertaken at HyPerComp Engineering with promising results.\nProgress has been made in expanding the knowledge of how filament\nwinding fibers and matrix systems (resins) react to loads and strain at\nextremely cold temperatures, such as would be encountered in in-space\nfuel storage depots.  As with the cryogenic composite pressure vessel\nresearch, HyPerComp Engineering has been conducting research and has\npatented, jointly with NASA, a robust impact resistant composite\npressure vessel technology.  This technology shows great promise in its\nresistance to performance degradation from impacts, such as might be\nexperienced in the space environment in the form of micrometeoroids and\nspace debris.  This &amp;quot;robust&amp;quot; technology has also demonstrated\n&amp;quot;non-catastrophic failure-mode&amp;quot; capabilities which could\npotentially reduce mission losses and tankage losses due to both space\ndebris and other incidental impacts.  We intend to develop a baseline\ncomposite material capable of both cryogenic and radiation applications.",
