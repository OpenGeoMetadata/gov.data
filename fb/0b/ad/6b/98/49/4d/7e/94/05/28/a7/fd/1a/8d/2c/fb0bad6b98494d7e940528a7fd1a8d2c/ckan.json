  "notes": "_Abstract:_  Annual average wind resource potential for the state of South Carolina at a 50 meter height.\r\n\r\n_Purpose:_  Provide information on the wind resource development potential within the state of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n_Supplemental Information:_  This data set has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants. However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development projects. This shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution, in a WGS 84 projection system.\r\n\r\nOther Citation Details:  The wind power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").
