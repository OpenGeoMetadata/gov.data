  "notes": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn August 1980, the Department of Defense (DOD) requested that the Department of Energy (DOE) identify and evaluate geothermal resources that might provide substitute energy at any of 76 defense installations. Gruy Federal, Inc. contracted with DOE to estimate the geologic characteristics and related economics of potential geothermal resources located at or near the 76 installations. The geologic assessment identified 18 installations with possible geothermal resources and 4 Atlantic Coastal Plain resource configurations that represented the alternatives available to East Coast bases.  (The China Lake Naval Weapons Center, containing the Coso Hot Spring area, and the naval installation at Adak, Alaska, were excluded from consideration because geothermal activities already are under way there.)  \nThese 18 locations and 4 resource configurations, together with 2 possible resources at the White Sands Missile Range and a potential resource at Kings Bay, Georgia, were examined to determine the relative economics of substituting potential geothermal energy for part or all of the existing oil, gas, and electrical energy usage. Four of the military installations Mountain Home, Norton, Hawthorne, and Sierra—appear to be co-located with possible geothermal resources which, if present, might provide substitute energy at or below current market prices for oil. Six additional locations Ellsworth, Luke, Williams, Bliss, Fallon, and Twentynine Palms—could become economically attractive under certain conditions. These preliminary economic conclusions are based on central estimates of possible resources by location and do not reflect the consequences of a dry hole or discovery of resources less adequate than the central estimates. Weighted-average estimates of geothermal costs based on a range of potential resources, together with the cost of a total failure, would be important additional elements in any subsequent study of the more promising locations.  No geothermal resource was found to be economically competitive with natural gas at current controlled prices. Generation of electric power at the locations studied is estimated to be uneconomic at present because of two factors in particular: the relatively high cost of the expected geothermal energy, and the large mechanical inefficiencies in conversion of low-temperature, low-pressure geothermal energy into electricity.  However, we must emphasize that these conclusions apply only to the locations we have studied and are based on the resource characterizations presented within the study.",
