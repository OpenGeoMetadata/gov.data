    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A consistent and accurate Hybrid gaskinetic BGK and DSMC method, valid in the full Knudsen number (Kn) range, is proposed as a 3D tool to handle hypersonic aerothermodynamics from continuum to thermochemical nonequilibrium and ionized/plasma flows. By domain-decomposition, the proposed method will provide adjoint but automated sub-domain solutions by solving the gaskinetic BGK method of Xu (BGKX) and DSMC in their respective low and high Knudsen regimes, therein the BGKX and DSMC solvers have been proven comparatively efficient for thermo-chemical nonequilibrium flows with accurate heat rate prediction.   The proposed approach is considered  an advancement in rarefied gasdynamic methodology in that: BGKX is efficient for near continuum flows, say 0 &lt;Kn &lt;0.1, and its extension to the Burnett order of Kn~0.5  has been assured; BGKX /DSMC share compatible gaskinetic fluxes, hence a consistent and simpler  flux reconstruction and numerically more stable scheme than that of hybrid Navier-Stokes/DSMC approach; and BGKX/DSMC can more suitably handle nonequilibrium/chemical reacting flow than the Direct Boltzmann Equation (DBE) approach. Phase I will construct 2D hybrid method, and validate its pressure/heat rate solutions with that of DSMC in full Knudsen range. Phase II will fully develop its 3D and aerothermodynamic capabilities for thermochemical nonequilibrium flows.",
