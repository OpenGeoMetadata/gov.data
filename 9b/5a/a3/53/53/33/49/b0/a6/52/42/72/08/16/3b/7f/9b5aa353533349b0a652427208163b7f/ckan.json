  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Aircraft Engine Test System (AETS) Laboratory combines a variety of capabilities for the design, development, test, integration and in-service engineering of hardware and software for computer controlled naval aviation propulsion test systems.  Function:  The AETS Lab is located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ where it houses the Jet Engine Test System Instrumentation (JETI), Shaft Engine Test System Instrumentation (SETI) and Turboprop Engine Test Instrumentation (TPTI) Engine Test Systems and General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE). In addition to its system level capabilities, the AETS Lab also serves as a test bed for the design, development, validation and verification (VAL/VER) and integration of engine specific or test system hardware. The AETS Lab also functions as a test bed for engine specific test program set (TPS) development, integration and VAL/VER. The AETS Lab augments and mirrors the AETS Fleet Support Team (FST) function at NAWCAD Lakehurst.  Capabilities:  Housing the JETI/SETI/TPTI Engine Test Systems, the AETS Lab provides the capability to conduct systems engineering, in-service engineering, design and development, prototyping, testing and training functions for both hardware and software of the JETI/SETI/TPTI Engine Test Systems. The lab is also capable of defining and validating software requirements, replicating and conducting investigations of discrepancies found in fleet systems, developing/integrating/test proofing of concepts solutions for hardware and software discrepancies and developing/integrating/testing hardware and software Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for the JETI/SETI/TPTI Engine Test Systems. The lab also provides the capabilities to perform technical publication validation and Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) on final drawing submittal.  ",
