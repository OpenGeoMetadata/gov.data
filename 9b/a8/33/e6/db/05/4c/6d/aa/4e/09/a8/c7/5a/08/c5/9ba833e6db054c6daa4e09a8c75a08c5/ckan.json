  "notes": " The MIT Lincoln Laboratory Microelectronics Laboratory is a state-of-the-art semiconductor research and fabrication facility supporting a wide range of Lincoln Laboratory programs. The 70,000-square-foot facility has 8100 square feet of class-10 and 10,000 square feet of class-100 cleanroom areas. The equipment set in this laboratory is continually updated and includes a production-class complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) toolset with angled ion-implantation, cluster-metallization, and dry-etch equipment; chemical-mechanical planarization equipment; and rapid thermal processing and advanced lithography capabilities. A molecular-beam epitaxy system is used to provide high sensitivity and highly stable back-illuminated devices in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet ranges. Current activities include the following:  The fabrication of flight-quality gigapixel charge-coupled device (CCD) imager focal planes Photon-counting avalanche photodiode arrays Radio frequency and optical microelectrical mechanical systems (MEMS) Niobium-based superconducting circuits A fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS circuit prototyping capability In addition, the Microelectronics Laboratory supports advanced packaging with a precision multichip module (MCM) technology and an advanced three-dimensional circuit stacking technology. Currently, over 40 different programs from five of the eight divisions at Lincoln Laboratory, as well as industrial sponsors involved through cooperative research and development agreements, are supported by the Microelectronics Laboratory, which is staffed by over 60 technicians, engineers, and scientists working two shifts each day, five days a week. The Microelectronics Laboratory began operations in 1994. A commemorative booklet highlights 20 important innovations that have been enabled by the facilites within this lab:   20 Innovations Over Twenty Years   (pdf). For more information about the Microelectronics Laboratory and its capabilities, contact MEL.Director@ll.mit.edu.  ",
