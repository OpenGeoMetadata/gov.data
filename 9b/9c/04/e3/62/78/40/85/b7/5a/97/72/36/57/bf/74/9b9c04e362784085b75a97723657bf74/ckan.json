    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "  This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Data Acquisition:**\r\n\r\n     The testbed comprises:\r\n\r\n    * Commercially available Li-ion 18650 sized rechargeable batteries,\r\n    * Programmable 4-channel DC electronic load,\r\n    * Programmable 4-channel DC power supply,\r\n    * Voltmeter, ammeter and thermocouple sensor suite,\r\n    * Custom EIS equipment,\r\n    * Environmental chamber to impose various operational conditions,\r\n    * PXI chassis based DAQ and experiment control, and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMATLAB based experiment control, data acquisition and prognostics algorithm evaluation setup (appx. data acquisition rate is 10Hz).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Parameter Description:**\r\n\r\n     Data Structure:\r\n\r\n     cycle: top level structure array containing the charge, discharge and impedance operations\r\n\r\n     type: operation  type, can be charge, discharge or impedance\r\n\r\n     ambient_temperature: ambient temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n     time: the date and time of the start of the cycle, in MATLAB  date vector format\r\n\r\n     data: data structure containing the measurements\r\n\r\n        for charge the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n            Current_charge: Current measured at charger (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at charger (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)\r\n\r\n        for discharge the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n            Current_charge: Current measured at load (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at load (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)\r\n\r\n            Capacity: Battery capacity (Ahr) for discharge till 2.7V\r\n\r\n        for impedance the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Sense_current: Current in sense branch (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Battery_current: Current in battery branch (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Current_ratio: Ratio of the above currents\r\n\r\n            Battery_impedance: Battery impedance (Ohms) computed from raw data\r\n\r\n            Rectified_impedance: Calibrated and smoothed battery impedance (Ohms)\r\n\r\n            Re: Estimated electrolyte resistance (Ohms)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n            Rct: Estimated charge transfer resistance (Ohms) \r\n\r\n**Intended Use:**\r\n\r\nThe data sets can serve for a variety of purposes. Because these are essentially a large number of Run-to-Failure time series, the data can be set for development of prognostic algorithms. In particular, due to the differences in depth-of-discharge (DOD), the duration of rest periods and intrinsic variability, no two cells have the same state-of-life (SOL) at the same cycle index. The aim is to be able to manage this uncertainty, which is representative of actual usage, and make reliable predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in both the End-of-Discharge (EOD) and End-of-Life (EOL) contexts. \r\n\r\n ",
