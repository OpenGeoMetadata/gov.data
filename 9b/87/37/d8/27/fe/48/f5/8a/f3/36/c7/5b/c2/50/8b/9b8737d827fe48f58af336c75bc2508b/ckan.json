    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "CU Aerospace proposes the development of a new parallel nonlinear program (NLP) solver software package. NLPs allow the solution of complex optimization problems, and there exist today a number of capable NLP solvers typically used within the astrodynamics community.  Unfortunately, none of them take into account the capabilities of a high performance computer with thousands of processors, nor use the recent advances in graphics processing unit (GPU) calculation.  Many NASA optimal trajectory packages (OTIS, MALTO, EMTG) have already streamlined and optimized their own code to run as fast as possible, and it is now the serial-execution nature of the existing packages that represents the largest bottleneck.\r\nThe new parallel NLP solver to be developed by CU Aerospace in partnership with the University of Illinois will represent a novel, ground-up redesign of this kind of solver.  It will be built to be transparently usable by the existing optimal trajectory solvers used at NASA; however, it will also take advantage of high performance computing and/or GPU processing to reduce the run time by orders of magnitude.  This has strong implications for NASA's mission design groups, as the time to solution for the trajectory teams will be significantly improved.  Further, an improved optimization tool will have applications across all fields at NASA which user optimization, from engineering design to cost analysis.  \r\nCU Aerospace is uniquely positioned to develop this new parallel NLP solver, with a team of experts, and the nearby proximity to the high performance computing resources at the National Center for Super Computing.",
