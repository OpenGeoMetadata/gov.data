  "notes": " The NIH Clinical Center consists of two main facilities: The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, which opened in 2005, houses inpatient units, day hospitals, and research labs. The Hatfield Center is connected to the original Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center. Together, the Magnuson and Hatfield facilities serve the dual role of providing humane and healing patient care and an unparalleled environment for clinical researchers to advance biomedical science. The original facility, the 2.5 million-square-foot Magnuson Center, contains more than 5,000 rooms, 15 outpatient clinics, a Laboratory Medicine Department housed in a space the size of a football field, and-before the Hatfield Center was opened-housed 24 inpatient care units. The new facility, the 870,000 square foot Hatfield Center, has 240 inpatient beds and 82 day-hospital stations. The Hatfield Center will continue to set the pace for developing the most promising medical advances. Annually, more than a thousand clinical studies are conducted at the NIH, and the close proximity of research labs (many just around the corner), equipment, and patient care units will help to rapidly move biomedical laboratory findings into the mainstream of medical practice. Studies currently underway at the NIH Clinical Center aim to make significant advances in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular disease, eye disorders, dental problems, depression, and nerve diseases, to name just a few.
