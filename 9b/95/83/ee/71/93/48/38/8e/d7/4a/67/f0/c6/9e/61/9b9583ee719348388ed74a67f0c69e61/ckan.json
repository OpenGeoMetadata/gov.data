  "notes": "In January and February, 2005, a contaminants investigation was conducted at Caddo Lake National Wildlife Refuge (CLNWR) by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The purpose of the investigation was to determine contaminant levels of organochlorine pesticides, metals, and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in muscle tissue and livers of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the Refuge. Samples were collected from 20 deer for this investigation. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel collected brain stems samples from five of the harvested deer and analyzed them for the presence of protease-resistant prion protein (PrP-res), the presence of which is diagnostic for chronic wasting disease (CWD). Results from this study were compared to human health screening criteria and will be used to determine if public hunting of white-tailed deer will be allowed on the Refuge and whether consumption of meat from the deer poses a human health risk. Eleven metals (aluminum, barium, boron, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, strontium, and zinc) and two pesticides (mirex and oxychlordane) were detected in one or more muscle samples. Thirteen metals (aluminum, barium, boron, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, strontium, and zinc) and five pesticides; total dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (total DDTs), total hexachlorocyclohexane (total BHC), oxychlordane, o,p’- dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (o,p’-DDE), and gamma hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-BHC) were detected in one or more liver samples. All contaminants in muscle samples were below their respective health based screening values and all but three contaminants (cadmium, copper, and selenium) in livers were below their respective health based screening values. Levels of contaminants in muscle tissue were not elevated enough to pose a threat to human health. Selenium in one liver tissue sample exceeded the health based screening value for children and adults. Cadmium and copper levels in deer livers may pose adverse health effects and therefore should not be consumed.",
