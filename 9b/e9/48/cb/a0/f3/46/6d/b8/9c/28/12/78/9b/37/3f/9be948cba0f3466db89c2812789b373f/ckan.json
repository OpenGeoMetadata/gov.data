    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.\n\nThis data set contains Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Level-3 daily measurements of surface soil moisture and vegetation/roughness water content interpretive information, as well as brightness temperatures and quality control variables. Ancillary data include time, geolocation, and quality assessment. Input brightness temperature data, corresponding to a 56 km mean spatial resolution, are resampled to a global cylindrical 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) cell spacing. Data have been spatially subsetted to the SMEX03 study areas in Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA and Brazil. The study period covers 1 April to 31 August 2003 for study areas in the USA and 6 November to 31 December 2003 for the Brazil study area. Total volume for this data set is approximately 70 MB. Data are stored in HDF-EOS format and are available via FTP.\n\nThese data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
