  "notes": " The Fuels and Lubricants Technology Team operates and maintains the Fuels and POL Labs at TARDEC. Lab experts adhere to standardized American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) International, ISO and federal testing methods. It also conducts highly specialized tests supporting basic research, product development, qualification and other TARDEC lab efforts. Testing capabilities cover necessary powertrain products for vehicles and equipment, including coolants and other fluids/solvents.  Capabilities:  TARDEC Fuels and POL Labs comprise 7,075 square feet with an additional 1,600 square feet of space for POL storage. Products tested at the labs include engine oil, gear oil, grease, coolants, hydraulic fluids, alternative and conventional fuels, solid film lubricants, brake fluids, nano-lubricants, solvents and cleaners. Qualification testing is conducted on vendor-supplied products to military specifications. Once the vendor product successfully passes test requirements, it&amp;#39;s added to the Qualified Products List for procurement. The TARDEC Fuels and Lubricants Research Facility at Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, is a government-owned, contractor-operated stand-alone laboratory with engine testing and analytical chemistry experiment capabilities and hundreds of standardized tests methods.  Benefits:  &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Independent government analysis, testing and interpretation of results. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Timely testing supporting in-house TARDEC projects, especially in conjunction with tests conducted in the GSPEL. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Historical background on products. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Development of custom products and associated specifications and documentation necessary for procurement.
