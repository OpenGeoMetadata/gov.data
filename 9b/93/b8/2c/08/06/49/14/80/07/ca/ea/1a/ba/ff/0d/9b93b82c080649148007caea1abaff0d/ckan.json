  "notes": "In 1995, work was begun south of Prairie City, Iowa, to restore abandoned  farmland to natural prairie habitat. This area has been named the Walnut Creek  National Wildlife Refuge (Figure 1). The refuge contains about ten square miles  of land, through which runs Walnut Creek and its tributaries. Presently, the land is covered mostly by farm fields, with woodland habitats that follow the creeks. These woodlands are generally moist from their proximity to the creek and from the runoff from the surrounding land. Removal of trees during restoration would significantly change the habitats and therefore would have repercussions on what species can survive in this area. The area would likely become drier because of the loss of shade which the trees provide. Also, trees help prevent runoff and erosion, holding water in place. Thus, species which require wetter habitats, such as some amphibians, might be less likely to survive in a true prairie environment. From May 1995 to April 1996,1 monitored several areas within Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge for presence of amphibians- My study had three main objectives: 1) To establish baseline data on amphibian populations and distributions at Walnut Creek, 2) To compare amphibian species diversity in the various habitats present in Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, and 3) To examine the area for rare species and the possible implications the presence of rare species might have on restoration progress. There were also three reasons for doing my study at this time: 1) No  previous studies have been done of this area, 2) Presence of rare or endangered species may call for changes in how restoration proceeds, 3) This is the time to obtain baseline data, for it cannot be done after restoration.",
