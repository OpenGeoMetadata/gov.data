    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "With the information age has come a dramatic increase in our ability to generate and collect data while the traditional techniques to analyze this tsunami of data have proven woefully inadequate. The amount of data collected and stored electronically is doubling every three years. Many researchers are simply overwhelmed by the amount of data. Scientific visualization remains the dominant form of data exploration but current tools are focused on image creation and lack the much needed embedded analysis capabilities. To address this urgent need, we propose to develop and introduce a first-of-its kind tool kit called SciViz2.  SciViz2 brings together key innovations in three separate fields of scientific visualization, data mining, and computer vision to offer an integrated solution for physics mining of the most complex of data sets;  multi-dimensional, multi-variate data sets. SciViz2 bridges the existing gap in software technology by providing a scalable knowledge discovery tool that combines the power of machine learning techniques with scientific visualization.\r\n\r\nOur Phase I goal is to develop a prototype and demonstrate the viability of the solution by applying it to one of the most challenging data analysis problem, that is the data from peta-scale particle simulations.  The underlying physics involves complex interaction of multi-variates and the output involves both grid-based and particle phase space data with nearly trillion particles and over 200 TB of data from a single run.   Phase II activity would involve full development of SciViz2 and its dissemination to the wider community. Our close collaboration with NASA's HPC group will be heavily leveraged to test and release the software for open use.\r\n",
