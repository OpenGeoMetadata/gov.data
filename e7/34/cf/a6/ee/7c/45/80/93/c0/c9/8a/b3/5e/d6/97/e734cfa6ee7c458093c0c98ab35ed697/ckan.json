    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The bathymetry data provided represent a continuous surface of interpolated point measurements of depth values of Lago Curuai, an Amazon River floodplain lake, upstream from Santarem, Para, Brazil, from measurements made in June of 2004. The first product contains the actual depth values (in meters) of the interpolated continuous surface saved as real numbers in both ENVI and GeoTIFF formats. Also available is a color scaled depth GeoTIFF image which has an embedded color scale bar. This secondary file is meant only for viewing but has the unique advantage of being a GeoTIFF file. Therefore, this map can be a background image with other projected files of interest in the area. Data provided in this data set were used to develop a methodology for processing and applying high resolution bathymetric data acquired with a Lowrance-480M ecosounder in the Amazon floodplain. This research was supported by the addition of Landast/TM images for planning and executing the survey. 4600 km of transects were processed semi-automatically and integrated into a georeferenced database. A digital elevation model with 15 m horizontal resolution and 1 cm vertical resolution was generated for the floodplain. The changes in inundated area and volume of water on the floodplain were estimated. Regression models were constructed to predict flood area and water stored volume from water level. The results of this research show that water level and flooded area mapped from images are good enough for estimating water stored volume in the Lago Grande de Curuai (Barbosa et al., 2006).",
