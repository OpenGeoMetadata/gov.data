  "notes": "This is a polygon dataset depicting the bounds of a regular 100K (60 minutes east-west by 30 minutes north-south) grid in geographic coordinates, NAD83, for the state of Louisiana. This grid corresponds to the nominal footprint of most standard USGS 100K maps of Louisiana. The dataset includes additional tiles that are not represented by corresponding USGS maps, but are named on National Ocean Service 100K map indices. Each grid arc has been densified with intermediate vertices to allow the grid to be accurately projected to other coordinate systems. Each arc that forms a side of a 100K grid cell has at least one, but no more than 5 intermediate vertices between its starting and ending nodes.",
