    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;During 2013 and 2015, the DARPA Robotics Challenge explored through a competition the tasks and technologies for robots to operate in a natural and man-made disasters. &amp;nbsp;NASA&amp;rsquo;s future need for robots in support of human exploration has significant overlap with the terrestrial need for&amp;nbsp;disaster relief&amp;nbsp;robots.&amp;nbsp; The area of focus is operations in areas that are difficult to access, are potentially hazardous to humans, and communications between robots and operators may have intermittent, limited or delayed networks.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, both NASA and disaster relief scenarios call for robots to arrive ahead of humans to perform work such as scouting and setting up logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During FY2013, NASA developed the Robonaut 5 robot for participation in the DARPA Robotics Challenge trials in December 2013.&amp;nbsp; The design of this robot was an aggressive build that was focused a strong showing at the DRC finals in 2015.&amp;nbsp; This approach sacrificed performance at the qualifying trials during December 2013. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During FY14, the R5 team partnered with the Institute for Human Machine Cognition (IHMC) robotics group through the National Robotics Initiative grant to apply IHMC&amp;rsquo;s walking algorithms to R5.&amp;nbsp; Throughout FY14, IHMC has improved R5&amp;rsquo;s walking, adding software to move towards the designed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In partnership with the National Science Foundation, NASA will produce two new R5 humanoid robots to be provided to two US robotics teams through a solicited competition.&amp;nbsp; During FY15, NASA will develop the Space Robotics Challenge with the Centennial Challenges program, with the desire to apply humanoid capabilities to future NASA applications.&amp;nbsp; The challenge will be a NASA centennial challenge those provided with a Robonaut 5 robot will use it in the challenge and winners of a simulation contest will also use the existing Robonaut 5 robots to compete. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the challenge are scheduled to be released in late spring/summer 2015.&lt;/p&gt;",
