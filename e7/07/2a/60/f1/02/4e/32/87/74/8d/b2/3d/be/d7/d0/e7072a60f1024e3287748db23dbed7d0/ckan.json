    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Integran Technologies USA Inc.(Pittsburgh, PA) is pleased to provide\nthis proposal in response to the Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) Request for Proposal (RFP) (#A1.03), &amp;quot;Aircraft Aging and\nDurability&amp;quot;. A material characterization technology is proposed\nthat is based on grain boundary structure-property relationship to\nimprove prediction of component life for nickel based superalloys. Since\nit has been well documented that the resistance to intergranular\ndegradation is a function of the special (i.e., structurally ordered\nlow- grain boundaries) grain boundary content in the material, the\nimprovement in bulk material performance can be achieved through careful\nmanipulation of the processing parameters to increase the presence of\nthese special interfaces.  The proposed program builds upon results of\nprevious proprietary developments by the applicant in the areas of the\nmicrostructural optimization via metallurgical thermo-mechanical\nprocessing and the developed modeling concept based on grain boundary\nstructure assessment. The program will involve material synthesis,\ntesting and characterization activities with a specific emphasis on\ncorrelating the materials performance with respect to the grain boundary\nmicrostructure. The objective for this phase I program is to establish\nthe inter-relationship amongst material processing, grain boundary\ncharacter distribution, corrosion and deformation behaviour of the\nmaterial.  As a result of significant advances already made in the\ndevelopment of grain boundary engineering, the program proposed herein\nis expected to have a high probability of success and can potentially\nlead to a cost-effective technology for mitigating the susceptibility to\nmicrostructural instability and corrosion associated with Ni-based\nsuperalloys. This program is expected to require six (6) months for\ncompletion at a total cost of $100,000.",
