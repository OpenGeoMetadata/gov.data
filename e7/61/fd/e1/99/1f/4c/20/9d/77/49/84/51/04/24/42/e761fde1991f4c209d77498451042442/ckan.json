    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "With more missions at high data rates demanding use of limited spectral resources, NASA's SCaN office recently coordinated a study to identify a space communications architecture to support future missions.  The study recommends precoded GMSK and AR4JA LDPC codes as preferred options in most Space Network and Ground Network forward and return links and Deep Space Network return links.  This modulation and coding pair provides excellent bandwidth-efficiency and greatly reduced transmitter SWaP.  Unfortunately, there are no high-data-rate AR4JA LDPC devices currently available and existing GMSK receivers operate far from the performance predicted by theory, especially in the presence of severe channel and equipment impairments.\r\n\r\nPhase I provided a design of a soft-decision generating GMSK demodulator integrated with an AR4JA LDPC decoder and with estimation and compensation of a comprehensive set of severe impairments.  Fixed-point simulations show performance within a small fraction of a dB of the performance with far less bandwidth-efficient modulations such as BPSK.  The results of this effort show the technical and commercial viability of an integrated GMSK/AR4JA LDPC design.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Phase 2 effort involves the development and delivery of a prototype transmitter and receiver to demonstrate the superior capabilities offered by this innovation and enable subsequent commercialization.  A simple and highly flexible GUI system for prototype configuration and control and modular API design will allow Phase II refinement of the design and facilitate integration in future commercial products.\r\n",
