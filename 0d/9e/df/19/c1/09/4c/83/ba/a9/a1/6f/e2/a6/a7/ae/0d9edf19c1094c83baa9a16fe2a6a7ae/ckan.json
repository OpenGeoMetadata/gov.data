To create the parent data set, parcel data from the seven counties were assembled by Dakota County GIS staff into a common coordinate system and combined into one shapefile; no attempt was made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. To create this derived data set for use in EPPLViewer 2001, the data was converted from shapefile format to EPPL .dgt (line) format by LMIC. NO ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THIS DERIVED DATA SET. See metadata for each county's parcel data set for more information.",
