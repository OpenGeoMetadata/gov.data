    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) Level 3AT data product consists of daily vertical profiles of temperature, aerosol extinction and concentrations of HCl, HF, CH4, NO by gas filter correlation radiometry and H2O, NO2, O3 by broadband filter radiometry.  The instrument measured atmospheric infrared absorption at wavelengths from 2.43 to 10.25 microns.  HALOE was flown on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) to investigate upper atmosphere chemistry, dynamics and radiative processes, particlarly stratospheric ozone destruction and chlorofluromethane impact on ozone.  HALOE is a solar occultation experiment which typically views 15 sunrise and sunset events each day. Limb measurements were made in the altitude range between 15 km and 60 - 130 km (depending on channel) with about 2.5 km resolution. For a given day, the profiles were in two distinct latitude bands, for the sunset and sunrise events.  Coverage across the full range of latitudes between 80S and 80N was achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six weeks, depending on the time of year. The HALOE Level 3AT data were processed with the version 19 algorithm.\n                                                      \nThe HALOE level 3AT product consists of 13 granules per day. A data granule is one HALOE species or subtype per day.  The following subtypes are available:\n\n 1) AEXTCH4 - aerosol extinction at 3.46 um (CH4 gas filter)  [1/km]\n 2) AEXTCO2 - aerosol extinction at 2.80 um (CO2 gas filter)  [1/km]\n 3) AEXTHCL - aerosol extinction at 3.40 um (HCL gas filter)  [1/km]\n 4) AEXTHF  - aerosol extinction at 2.45 um (HF gas filter)   [1/km]\n 5) AEXTNO  - aerosol extinction at 5.26 um (NO gas filter)   [1/km]\n 6) CH4     - methane                                         [vmr]\n 7) H2O     - water vapor                                     [vmr]\n 8) HCL     - hydrogen chloride                               [vmr]\n 9) HF      - hydrogen fluoride                               [vmr]\n10) NO      - nitric oxide                                    [vmr]\n11) NO2     - nitrogen dioxide                                [vmr]\n12) O3      - ozone                                           [vmr]\n13) TEMP    - atmospheric temperature                         [Kelvin]\n\n*vmr = volume mixing ratio\n\nHALOE data are on the UARS standard pressure levels (in mbars) given by:\n\nP(i) =  1000 * 10**(-i/6)  for i = 0, 1, 2, ... 54\n\nEach of the 13 HALOE granules is accompanied by 2 additional parameter files, designated as level 3TP.  The first parameter file, subtype LAT, contains the latitude values for each pressure level of each event for the day.  The second parameter file, subtype LON, contains the longitude values.  The level 3AT files only contain the latitude/longitude location corresponding to the 30 km retrieval point. The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.",
