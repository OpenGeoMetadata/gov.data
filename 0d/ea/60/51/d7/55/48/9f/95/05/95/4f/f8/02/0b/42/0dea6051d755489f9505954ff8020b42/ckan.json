    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tRenewable energy sources, including wind and solar, can supply a significant amount of electrical energy globally, but their potential has not been fully exploited yet, due to their intermittent nature, which requires safe, cost-effective, and reliable electrical energy-storage systems. Such storage systems will also be critical to improve the robustness and efficiency of the electrical distribution grid by reducing power surges and balancing the load over time. Electrochemical energy-storage devices, i.e., batteries and fuel cells, are promising because of their scalability and versatility, but most fuel cells cannot be reversed electrically (i.e., charged) efficiently. Consequently, batteries, especially flow batteries, wherein the energy density can be increased independently of power density, remain as the preferred option for large-scale energy storage. Several types of flow batteries, i.e., including true redox systems, (ionic solutions comprising vanadium salts or iron-chromium salts), reversible fuel cells with gaseous reactants, and hybrid flow batteries (e.g., metallic anodes as in Zn-Br, or Zn-air), are being developed. The Vanadium Redox Battery is perhaps the most developed flow battery, but still has several deficiencies, such as: i) Low energy densities, (~ 25 Wh/kg, and 20-30 Wh/liter, which is about 1/5th of conventional Li-ion batteries), ii) Low efficiency of 60&#37;, and iii) Non-ecomomic cost (~ 6-20 times the target of $100/kWh, mainly due to high cost of Vanadium reactants and Nafion membranes. To mitigate these issues, new chemically-stable redox couples, with high cell voltage (possible only in non-aqueous electrolytes) are desired and being proposed here to improve energy and power densities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
