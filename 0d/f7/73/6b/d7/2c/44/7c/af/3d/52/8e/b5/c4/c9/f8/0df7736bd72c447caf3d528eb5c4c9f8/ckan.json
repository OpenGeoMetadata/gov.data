    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this NASA STTR program is to develop single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based ultracapacitors for energy storage devices (ESD) application, using NanoSonic's patented molecular level self-assembly process performed at room temperature. Specifically, we would combine advances in metallic SWCNTs, metal and oxide nanoclusters, and polymeric materials and electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) processes, to enable large-area, low-cost and integrated device manufacturing on rigid and flexible substrates. Such a combination of solution-based thin film deposition approaches to form ultracapacitor based devices and materials offers advantages over conventional high temperature and costly processes such as vacuum processes and vapour-phase deposition, in that very different materials can be incorporated uniformly at room temperature and pressure. We will perform synthesis of SWCNT and other precursors that can be used for ESA processing and transitioned to deposition of two-dimensional patterned materials.  Layer by Layer fabrication of multilayered CNT enhanced ultracapacitors leads to the analysis of chemical, physical and optical properties during and after synthesis, and verification of material morphology and response. We will study the cyclic voltammetric (CV) behavior and derive the power density from the inner integrated area. We will also investigate the specific capacitance as a function of discharge current density. From here, NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will develop an equivalent circuit model of the CNT ultracapacitor device for NASA applications. NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will also experimentally validate CNT ultracapacitor performance through extended field test evaluation, and possible testing with industrial partners, and produce first-generation ultracapacitors and energy storage systems for sale.",
