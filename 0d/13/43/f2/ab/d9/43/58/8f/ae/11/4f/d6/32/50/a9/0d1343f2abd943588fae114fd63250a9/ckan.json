  "notes": "This dataset represents sensitive wildlife data collected for the Center for Natural Lands Management (CNLM) at dedicated nature preserves in San Diego County, California. Data included were collected by CNLM staff, their subcontractors, as well as by biological consulting firms that conducted surveys for developers prior to preserve dedication to CNLM (which occurred in 2000), and spans from 1998 to 2007. Preserves were dedicated during different years, please call CNLM if you want information regarding year of preserve dedication. Most records in this dataset were collected during sensitive species research surveys, but some are anecdotal sitings. All sensitive bird species were located during focused U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protocol surveys for listed species such as the coastal California gnatcatcher (CAGN) and least Bell's vireo. For example, we (and our subcontractors) survey no more than about 100 acres per day for CAGN and note all sensitive species we detect. We conduct these surveys 2-5 Last, this dataset does not represent all sensitive species observed by CNLM. For example, CNLM has conducted surveys using bird point counts and herp arrays. For example, we have observed a high abundance of rufous-crowned sparrows at our Rancho La Costa Preserve during bird point counts, and this data will be incorporated at a future date. Data may be distributed.",
