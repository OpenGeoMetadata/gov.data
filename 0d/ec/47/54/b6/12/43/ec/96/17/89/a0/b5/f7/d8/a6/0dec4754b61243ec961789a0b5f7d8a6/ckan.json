    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The innovation proposed here is a complete, wireless remote sensing solution using passive SAW Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) sensors and a wireless interrogation system. Prior to the Phase I activity, wireless, passive sensors which could operate in a multi-sensor environment had not been successfully demonstrated. This is no longer the case. An experimental transceiver test bed has been built in Phase I and wireless temperature sensing has been demonstrated. Using OFC sensors developed by the University of Central Florida (UCF), remote temperature sensing at distances of up to several feet at 250 MHz has been accomplished. Further, work on electrically small antennas (ESA) has demonstrated that antennas more commensurate with the sensor size can be achieved. A smaller sensor/antenna package yields a more flexible sensor solution. Using the results form Phase I, it is proposed that a prototype interrogator be built and operation demonstrated at 915 MHz in a multi-sensor environment.\r\n\r\n",
