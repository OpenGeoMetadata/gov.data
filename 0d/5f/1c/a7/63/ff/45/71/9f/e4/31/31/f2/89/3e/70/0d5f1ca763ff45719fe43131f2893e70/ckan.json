  "notes": "These data consists of 81 watershed delineations in one seamless dataset of drainage areas called Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Major Watersheds. DNR Major Watersheds are the largest administrative Minnesota watershed unit delineation existing at the 4th defined level in the Minnesota DNR watershed unit hierarchy. These modern DNR Major Watersheds are derived from the DNR Catchment base-watershed dataset. Although the lineage of these watershed delineations dates back to the early 1970?s, this data is an updated version of the DNR Major legacy watershed dataset that has been in existence in various published formats since 1979. This new linework represents the general appearance of the legacy data. However, the geometry is considerably different. This has resulted from the DNR Watershed Delineation Projects? methodology, which incorporates modern data sources to delineate watersheds that reflect the current hydrology and topography of the landscape. These modern DNR Major Watershed delineations have been clipped to the Minnesota state boundary. For a more detailed background on this data, follow this link to the paper DNR Watershed Project: History, Methodology, Terminology, Attributes 2009(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us:8080/gis/ancillary/DNR_Watershed_Project_History_Methodology_Terminology_Attributes_2009.pdf) document (PDF).
