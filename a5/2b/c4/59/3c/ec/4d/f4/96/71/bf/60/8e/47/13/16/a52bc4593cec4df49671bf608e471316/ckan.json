  "notes": "Digital elevation model (DEM) data are arrays of regularly spaced elevation values referenced horizontally either to a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection or to a geographic coordinate system. The grid cells are spaced at regular intervals along south to north profiles that are ordered from west to east. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) produces five primary types of elevation data: 7.5-minute DEM, 30-minute DEM, 1-degree DEM. These datasets were derived from USGS 7.5' DEM Quads for the main 8 Hawaiian Islands. Individual DEM quads were converted to a common datum, and vertical unit, and subsequently mosaicked in ArcGIS 9.x. The DEM for Hawaii (Big Island) has a coordinate system of NAD83 UTM5N. The DEM for the remaining 7 islands (Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai and Niihau) have a coordinate system of NAD83 UTM4N. All rasters have a spatial resolution of 10 meters and are in the ESRI grid format. On this metadata sheet, the bounding coordinates and row and column counts are for a hypothetical 10m grid that would contain the 8 main Hawaiian Islands. For bounding coordinates and the number of rows and columns for each actual, individual DEM, users should consult their respective layer properties.",
