    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this Phase II project is to develop and demonstrate a compact and reliable oscillator technology for the frequency band from 100 ? 250 GHz for use in terahertz local oscillators and transmitters. The new oscillators rely on MMIC technology that is reliable and robust, offers the best overall performance and will be suitable for volume production and commercialization. These oscillators meet immediate needs for NASA's Earth Science program, specifically for terahertz radiometers for studies of the atmosphere and climate change. The oscillators are also useful for a wide range of other scientific, military and emerging commercial applications. The Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility of the new oscillators through the development and demonstration of an oscillator at 146 GHz suitable as a driver for an 874 GHz cloud ice radiometer being developed at NASA/GSFC. This new component greatly exceeds the performance of any other commercially available oscillator technology while maintaining a compact size, power efficiency and all solid-state construction. The Phase II research is focused on achieving greater power for higher frequency terahertz sources, improving power efficiency, achieving more compact integration of the subcomponents and extending the basic design concept throughout the 100 ? 250 GHz band.
