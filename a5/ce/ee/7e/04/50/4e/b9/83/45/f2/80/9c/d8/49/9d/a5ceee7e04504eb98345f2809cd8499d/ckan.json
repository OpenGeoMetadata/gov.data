  "notes": "We conducted a 6-year evaluation of the North Cascades Grizzly Bear Ecosystem (NCGBE) in north-central Washington to determine the suitability of the area to support a viable grizzly bear population. The presence of grizzly bears in the ecosystem was verified through the confirmation of field observations of bears. Of 238 reported observations, 22 were confirmed as grizzly bears and another 82 were rated as high reliability observations. Capture and marking of resident grizzly bears was unsuccessful. We surveyed areas of the ecosystem with self-activated cameras; no grizzly bears were documented using this method. Analysis of bear scats provided a preliminary list of probable grizzly bear foods in the North Cascades. We used Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery and a ground-based vegetative inventory to develop a map of vegetation for the NCGBE. An accuracy assessment of the interpreted data showed that the general vegetation types were properly mapped at an accuracy level of 94.8%; a detailed, modeled, vegetation map was produced with an accuracy level of 93.2%. We developed additional data layers in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate the availability and distribution of vegetation types seasonally, assess the impacts of human activities on the habitat, assess ungulate food sources, and estimate the abundance of probable grizzly bear foods in various vegetation types.",
