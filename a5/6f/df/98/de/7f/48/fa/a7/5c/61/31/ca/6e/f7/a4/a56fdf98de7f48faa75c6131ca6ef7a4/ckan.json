    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe optical design of RAISE is based on a new class of UV/EUV imaging spectrometers that use&amp;nbsp; only two reflections to provide quasi-stigmatic performance simultaneously over multiple wavelengths&amp;nbsp; and spatial fields. Figure 5 summarizes the RAISE instrument design, showing photographs of each of&amp;nbsp; the components or subsystems. The design uses an off-axis parabolic telescope mirror to form a real&amp;nbsp; image of the sun on the spectrometer entrance aperture. A slit then selects a portion of the solar image,&amp;nbsp; passing its light onto a near-normal incidence toroidal grating, which re-images the spectrally dispersed&amp;nbsp; radiation onto two array detectors. Two full spectral passbands over the same one-dimensional spatial&amp;nbsp; field are recorded simultaneously with no scanning of the detectors or grating. The two different spectral&amp;nbsp; bands (1st-order 1205-1243&amp;Aring; and 1526-1564&amp;Aring;) are imaged onto two intensified Active Pixel Sensor&amp;nbsp; (APS) detectors whose focal planes are individually adjusted for optimized performance. The telescope&amp;nbsp; and grating are coated with B4C to enhance short wavelength (2nd order) reflectance (Fig. 6), enabling the&amp;nbsp; instrument to record the brightest lines between 602-622&amp;Aring; and 761-780&amp;Aring; at the same time. Table 1&amp;nbsp; summarizes the main optical parameters for RAISE. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;strong&gt;TVLS Grating. &lt;/strong&gt;The single toroidal variable line space (TVLS) grating has a toroidal surface&amp;nbsp; (Sagittal Radius = 640.5 mm, Tangential Radius = 635.3 mm), with varied line space (VLS) rulings of the&amp;nbsp; type developed originally for spherical substrates by Kita, Harada, and collaborators (1983, 1995). By&amp;nbsp; combining this VLS concept with toroidal surfaces, RAISE is the first to exploit this new class of&amp;nbsp; spectrometers, as described by Thomas (2003). For RAISE, the grating is placed 400 mm behind the slit,&amp;nbsp; with focus at a distance of approximately 1700 mm, for a spectrometer magnification of 4.25. By&amp;nbsp; operating at high magnification, the RAISE spectrometer most effectively utilizes the full length and&amp;nbsp; width available in the sounding rocket payload. The first RAISE grating, mechanically ruled by Bach&amp;nbsp; Research, Inc., was delivered in August 2007 and tested for figure, ruling density and total grating&amp;nbsp; efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;strong&gt;Intensified APS Cameras&lt;/strong&gt;. The RAISE Intensified APS camera systems are 1k x 1k CMOS Active&amp;nbsp; Pixel Sensors using miniature digital camera electronics and fed by an MCP intensifier. APS cameras&amp;nbsp; were chosen for RAISE (rather than CCDs) because of their extremely fast readout, direct digital output,&amp;nbsp; low mass, low power, deep full well and high radiation tolerance. The RAISE cameras were developed at&amp;nbsp; DLR (Germany) using a Cypress/Filfactory Star 1000 APS and include a 12-bit external ADC and USB&amp;nbsp; 2.0 interface. We will operate the cameras at 5-10 frames/sec readout, making dark current negligible&amp;nbsp; compared to the incoming signal. The complete camera electronics including its controller is integrated&amp;nbsp; on only one printed circuit board, and uses a rigid-flex 3D-interconnection between the boards to form a&amp;nbsp; lightweight, compact sensor head. Flight detectors were delivered by DLR in August 2008.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAISE Chromospheric Slit Jaw Camera (SJC)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To co-align the RAISE spectra with observations from SDO, HINODE, and IRIS, and to collect&amp;nbsp; chromospheric disk images in C IV and the continuum between 1500-1700 &amp;Aring;, the solar image at the&amp;nbsp; telescope focal plane (spectrograph entrance slit plane) is re-imaged onto a SJC mounted on the bottom&amp;nbsp; side of the optical bench. The slit plane is tilted 5 degrees to reflect incident light onto a pair of flat relay&amp;nbsp; mirrors that fold the light down through the optical bench to a re-imaging system mounted to the bottom&amp;nbsp; side of the optical bench, through a 200 &amp;Aring; wide interference filter centered at 1600 &amp;Aring;, and then onto an&amp;nbsp; intensified APS camera identical to those discussed above. The SJC re-images the 4&amp;#39; x 16&amp;#39; region of the&amp;nbsp; slit plane onto the camera with 4.25:1 magnification (matching the magnification of the spectrograph) for&amp;nbsp; an image plate scale of 1.0&amp;quot;/pixel.&amp;nbsp; The primary purpose of the RAISE Slit Jaw Camera (SJC) is to provide co-alignment context images&amp;nbsp; for the spectroscopic observations with those from other ground and space-based platforms. The&amp;nbsp; relatively broad passband (1600 &amp;plusmn; 100&amp;Aring;) SJC image consists of largely chromospheric continuum and a&amp;nbsp; large contribution (20&#37; of the signal in the quiet-Sun) from the C IV line at 1550&amp;Aring; and provide &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;nbsp; loop&amp;rdquo; and evolving supergranular context for the spectral observations discussed above. The SJC&amp;nbsp; observations will also enable us to actively study the connection, if any, of broad-frequency spectrum&amp;nbsp; oscillations in the chromosphere, how they dynamically interact with the magnetic fields that thread the&amp;nbsp; line of sight of the spectrograph slit and how they connect to the spectroscopic signals in the upper&amp;nbsp; chromosphere, transition region and low corona (e.g., McIntosh &amp;amp; Poland 2004).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
