    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A key component to solving many engineering challenges of UAS integration into the National Airspace System is the ability to state the numbers of forecasted UAS by airframe and mission/operation type being performed within discrete airspaces. UAS growth is a function of locational based businesses and public use needs, in addition to increases in UAS uses and future aircraft types. Being able to forecast this growth requires time consuming and highly detailed configuration and model development, consensus between different organizations, and flexible tools tunable to changing perspectives. Availability of a common cloud based application integrating varying growth curves and linking geospatial aspects of UAS operations will greatly enhance and stabilize system level analysis of issues such as: radio spectrum usage, safety case analysis, economic forecasts, etc. Individuals and organizations would benefit in using a community centric tool with the ability to shared data and projections while still allowing individual researchers to set up paradigms for their own, unique forecasts.  The overall project objective is to design, develop, and study the feasibility and potential benefits of a UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density (UAxpan) system which allows for common solutions in complex forecasts of growth and uses of numerous unmanned systems and mission/operational types. This will be accomplished by developing and testing a prototype system and performing the key functionality objectives using real industry, UAS, geographic, and NAS data.",
