    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

The HALOE instrument typically views 15 sunrise and\n                  sunset events each day, scanning the solar disk from limb to limb\n                  during each event.  The latitude/longitude location of the HALOE data\n                  varies with the spacecraft-Earth-Sun position.  For a given day, the\n                  locations tend to be in two distinct latitude bands and to sweep\n                  across the full longitude range.  Coverage across the full range of\n                  latitudes is achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six\n                  weeks depending on the time of year.  The latitude coverage extends\n                  from 80 degrees north to 80 degrees south.\n                  \n                  The HALOE level 3AT data consist of 13 granules per day.  A data\n                  granule is one HALOE species or subtype per day.  The following\n                  subtypes are available: 1) AEXTCH4 - aerosol extinction at 3.46 um\n                  (CH4 gas filter), 2) AEXTCO2 - aerosol extinction at 2.80 um (CO2 gas\n                  filter), 3) AEXTHCL - aerosol extinction at 3.40 um (HCL gas filter),\n                  4) AEXTHF - aerosol extinction at 2.45 um (HF gas filter), 5) AEXTNO -\n                  aerosol extinction at 5.26 um (NO gas filter), 6) CH4 - methane, 7)\n                  H2O - water vapor, 8) HCL - hydrogen chloride, 9) HF - hydrogen\n                  fluoride, 10) NO - nitric oxide, 11) NO2 - nitrogen dioxide, 12) O3 -\n                  ozone, and 13) TEMP - atmospheric temperature.  Aerosol extinction\n                  coefficients are measured in units of 1/km, chemical species are given\n                  in parts per million by volume (ppmv), and temperature is in units of\n                  degrees Kelvin.\n                  \n                  Each of the 13 HALOE granules is accompanied by 2 additional parameter\n                  files, designated as level 3TP.  The first parameter file, subtype\n                  LAT, contains the latitude values for each pressure level of each\n                  event for the day.  The second parameter file, subtype LON, contains\n                  the longitude values.  The level 3AT files only contain the\n                  latitude/longitude location corresponding to the 30 km retrieval\n                  point.\n                  \n                  The HALOE level 3AT data product consist of profiles that have been\n                  interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original\n                  profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS\n                  project for all limb-viewing instruments.  The level 3AT format is\n                  common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.  The\n                  level 3AT data product consists of time-ordered profiles, and are\n                  spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or about 495 km\n                  along the tangent track (horizontal resolution).  The vertical\n                  resolution for the level 3AT HALOE profiles is defined by the UARS\n                  pressure levels (in mbars) given by:\n                  \n                  P(i) =  1000 * 10**(-i/6) for i = 0, 1, 2,...",
