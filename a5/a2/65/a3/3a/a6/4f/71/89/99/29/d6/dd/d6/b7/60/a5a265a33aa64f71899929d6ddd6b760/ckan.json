By achieving its goals the NCL will provide a comprehensive set of baseline characterization parameters that will enable cancer biologists, drug and diagnostic developers, and clinical oncologists to apply their tools to solving problems that most affect cancer patients. This work will also lay a scientific foundation that will enable the FDA to make sound decisions concerning the testing and approval of nanoscale cancer diagnostics, imaging agents, and therapeutics. To achieve its Mission, the NCL has established the following six objectives:   Establish and Standardize an Analytical Cascade for Nanomaterial Characterization    Facilitate the Clinical Development and Regulatory Review of Nanomaterials for Cancer Clinical Trials    Identify and Characterize Critical Parameters Related to Nanomaterials&amp;#39; Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity Profiles of Nanomaterials Using Animal Models    Examine the Biological and Functional Characteristics of Multicomponent/Combinatorial Aspects of Nanoscaled Therapeutic, Molecular and Clinical Diagnostics, and Detection Platforms    Engage and Facilitate Academic and Industrial-Based Knowledge Sharing of Nanomaterial Performance Data and Behavior Resulting from Pre-Clinical Testing (i.e. Physical Characterization, In VitroTesting, and In VivoPharmaco- and Toxicokinetics)    Interface with Other Nanotechnology Efforts  "
