    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project aims to provide Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for radiation-tolerant, wide-temperature-range digital, analog, mixed-signal, and radio-frequency electronic components suitable for operation in the extreme environments of the Moon, Mars, and other deep space destinations.  All such exploration systems will need reliable electronics able to operate in a wide temperature range (-230?C to +130 ?C) and high radiation levels. There is very little knowledge of semiconductor device behavior in extreme low temperatures (currently ongoing research) and no reliable models or design tools. CFDRC will develop first commercial-quality validated models and CAD tools for predicting the electrical performance and reliability of electronic components in extreme low temperatures, with included radiation effects and reliability analysis, using coupled semiconductor and thermal-mechanical simulation. This work will use and implement the newest data from the ongoing NASA Exploration Systems and Research Technology (Code ES&amp;RT) program, led by Prof. Cressler at Georgia Tech (subcontractor in this proposal), involving JPL, BAE, Boeing, Vanderbilt, and others, aimed at developing electronics technology for mixed-signal circuit applications for lunar (to -230?C) applications. Reliable and validated CAD tools will help to predict electronics performance and radiation response in the extreme temperatures, and reduce the amount of testing cost and time.",
