  "notes": "The Fish and Wildlife Service prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for migratory bird hunting seasons. The effect of this final rule is to facilitate the States' selection of hunting seasons and to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. This dataset contains the administrative High Plains Mallard Management Unit delineation that is used by states in this process. The High Plains Mallard Management Unit consists of all areas in the Central Flyway west of the easternmost areas/boundaries described below. North Dakota High Plains Unit: That portion of the State south and west of a line from the South Dakota State line along U.S. 83 and Iâ94 to ND 41, north to U.S. 2, west to the Williams/Divide County line, then north along the County line to the Canadian border. South Dakota High Plains Zone: That portion of the State west of a line beginning at the North Dakota State line and extending south along U.S. 83 to U.S. 14, east on U.S. 14 to Blunt, south on the Blunt-Canning Rd to SD 34, east and south on SD 34 to SD 50 at Leeâs Corner, south on SD 50 to Iâ90, east on Iâ90 to SD 50, south on SD 50 to SD 44, west on SD 44 across the Platte-Winner bridge to SD 47, south on SD 47 to U.S. 18, east on U.S. 18 to SD 47, south on SD 47 to the Nebraska State line. Nebraska High Plains: That portion of Nebraska lying west of a line beginning at the South Dakota-Nebraska border on U.S. Hwy. 183; south on U.S. Hwy. 183 to U.S. Hwy. 20; west on U.S. Hwy. 20 to NE Hwy. 7; south on NE Hwy. 7 to NE Hwy. 91; southwest on NE Hwy. 91 to NE Hwy. 2; southeast on NE Hwy. 2 to NE Hwy. 92; west on NE Hwy. 92 to NE Hwy. 40; south on NE Hwy. 40 to NE Hwy. 47; south on NE Hwy. 47 to NE Hwy. 23; east on NE Hwy. 23 to U.S. Hwy. 283; and south on U.S. Hwy. 283 to the Kansas-Nebraska border. Kansas High Plains Zone: That portion of the State west of U.S. 283. Oklahoma High Plains Zone: The Counties of Beaver, Cimarron, and Texas. Texas High Plains Zone: That portion of the State west of a line extending south from the Oklahoma State line along U.S. 183 to Vernon, south along U.S. 283 to Albany, south along TX 6 to TX 351 to Abilene, south along U.S. 277 to Del Rio, then south along the Del Rio International Toll Bridge access road to the Mexico border. Central Flyway--includes Colorado (east of the Continental Divide), Kansas, Montana (Counties of Blaine, Carbon, Fergus, Judith Basin, Stillwater, Sweetgrass, Wheatland, and all counties east thereof), Nebraska, New Mexico (east of the Continental Divide except the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation), North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming (east of the Continental Divide). This boundary was defined as the result of an assessment of mallard band-recovery and harvest distributions conducted back in the early 1970s.",
