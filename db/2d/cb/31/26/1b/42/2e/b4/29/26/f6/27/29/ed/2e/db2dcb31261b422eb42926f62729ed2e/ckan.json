    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Further refinements to the FOSS technologies are focusing on &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; sensing techniques that adjust sensing parameters as needed in real time so that only the necessary amount of data is acquired &amp;ndash; no more, no less. Traditional FOSS signal processing is based on Fourier transforms that break up the length of the fiber into analysis sections that are equal in length along the whole fiber. If high resolution is required along one portion of the fiber, the whole fiber must be processed at that resolution. Wavelet transforms make it possible to efficiently break up the length of the fiber into analysis sections that vary in length. If high resolution is required along one portion of the fiber, only that portion is processed at high resolution, and the rest of the fiber can be processed at the lower resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;/strong&gt;: The team has developed a C language prototype of a wavelet-based signal processing algorithm. This static form currently operates at half the speed of the Fourier-based algorithm but it will be able to operate 3-4 times faster when optimized.&amp;nbsp;The team has also developed a LabVIEW prototype of the adaptive form of the algorithm. This form provides real-time adaptive spatial resolution.&amp;nbsp;For example: when strain on a wing increases during flight, the software will automatically increase the resolution on the part of the fiber that is under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;: Next steps involve optimizing the code and implementing it on a digital signal processing (DSP) chip.&amp;nbsp;A patent application for the wavelet algorithm has been filed with the USPTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: Offers precision measurement only where it is needed rather than on the entire fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster signal processing&lt;/strong&gt;: Data can be processed at different resolutions at different fiber segments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive&lt;/strong&gt;: Automatically selects optimum resolution based on data received&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strain sensing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Temperature measurements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
