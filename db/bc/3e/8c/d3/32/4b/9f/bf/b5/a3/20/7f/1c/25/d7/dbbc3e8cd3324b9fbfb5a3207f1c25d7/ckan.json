    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NanoSonic has demonstrated that Shape Memory Metal Rubber&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; (SM-MR) adaptive skins exhibit reconfigurable and durable RF properties.  It is hypothesized that such morphing skins shall also exhibit durable radiation resistance upon morphing; a property that few, if any, flexible materials offer.  Typical highly filled or metal evaporated nanocomposites crack and spall upon flexation, and cannot be repeatedly mechanically stretched without rupture after a few cyclic strains.  SM-MR nanostructured morphing materials are based on self-assembled high z, dense, Au and Ag nanoparticles, rather than Pb.  Our manufacturing process yields tough skins that can be repeatedly and severely mechanically morphed without loss of EMI shielding (-88dB).  NanoSonic, together with Colorado State University, have demonstrated that SM-MR is up to 50&#37; lighter in weight and provides greater gamma ray attenuation relative to commercial off-the-shelf shielding materials, without emitting harmful secondary radiation under a 137Cs source.  During Phase I, radiation shielding would be verified for SM-MR during potential disparate space array morphed configurations to demonstrate durability, stowability, and reconfigurability for space tolerant structures with self-healing properties to reach TRL6.  TRL8 and 9 shall be reached during Phase II and III with assistance from our space systems prime partner upon flight testing and integration.",
