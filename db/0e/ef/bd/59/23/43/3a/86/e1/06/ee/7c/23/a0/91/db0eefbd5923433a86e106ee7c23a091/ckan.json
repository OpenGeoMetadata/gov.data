    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;quot;Deformable mirrors (DM) are key to achieving high contrast for any mission to image expolanets. Currently Northrup Grumman Xinetics is the only viable source for high-contrast capable deformable mirrors. This proposal will help to develop a deformable mirror with integrated driver electronics, eliminating traditional bulky external driver electronics and the associated cabling. The DM will have reduced mass and volume and will consume less power than traditional DMs. In addition to the reduced mass and volume, the approach incorporates a number of innovations to improve overall DM performance. The actuator uses single crystal giant-piezos offering up to 10 times the energy density of conventional ceramics, and a force-focused and cantilevered configuration to maximize the transducers energy efficiency in generating mirror motions. In addition, it utilizes a bulk micromachining process for DM fabrication in order to create a single crystal architecture at low cost and with a high optical quality surface figure. When fully developed, the DMs are expected to have large stroke (8-um), low-voltage (~40V), low weight, fast rise time (10 microseconds) and low manufacturing cost. Our price/performance goal is 10,000 actuators with a 10 kHz framing rate for $40k. The technology is scalable from hundreds of actuators to millions of actuators. Microscale delivered a first generation DM to JPL under an SBIR grant in early March 2011. This first generation DM driver was delivered with a simple Microchip-based serial interface from the ASIC to a control computer, and detailed documentation on the ASIC interface protocol. JPL will develop an FPGA high-speed ASIC/computer interface, one capable of operating the DM at its full frame rate. Once the high-speed DM driver is complete, JPL will characterize the delivered 32x32 DM in the lab. We will measure the frame rate of the DM, actuator response speed, maximum stroke, go to positioning accuracy, number of dead ac&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
