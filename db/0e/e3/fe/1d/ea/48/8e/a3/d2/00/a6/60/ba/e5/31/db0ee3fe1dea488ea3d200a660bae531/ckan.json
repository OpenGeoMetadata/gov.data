    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The proposed technology reduces crew reliance of ground and paper procedure support in deep-space human spaceflight missions by providing real-time, in situ task guidance,&amp;nbsp;and reducing the training burden by providing all relevant information into the operator field of view. AR has the potential to assist crew in many nominal and off nominal operational procedures execution, thus enabling crew autonomous operation and reducing their dependency on ground support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marker-less AR system that minimizes tagging logistics and registration is especially attractive for space operations.&amp;nbsp; This technology uses a camera and image processing technique to create a &amp;ldquo;point cloud&amp;rdquo; map to register the real-world objects, which then enables the crew to get overlay information directly in the crew&amp;#39;s field of view through the AR glasses. Procedure steps and animated 3D overlays of the device being worked on can significantly minimize the maintenance operations difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is proposed as a multiyear effort.&amp;nbsp; Three AR prototypes were developed in year one to assess and to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology in the context of electronic procedures and maintenance operations.&amp;nbsp; The second year objectives are to enhance the vision processing capability and to improve robustness of the year one prototypes.&amp;nbsp; If successful, the third year will focus on assessing the feasibility to fly the proposed system as an ISS DTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
