    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "MRi is proposing, with its partner, Exotherm Corp (Camden, NJ) to demonstrate the feasibility of using exothermic brazing to join RCC (or C:SiC) composites to itself and/or to metal structures as an in orbit repair technique. The proposed Phase I work would be aimed at developing powder based brazing performs that would contain elements and compounds in powder particles that have been formed to have nano-phase dispersions of reactant compounds. These powder based performs would be placed in joints that upon ignition by spark or laser would self-propagate, releasing sufficient heat to braze reinforced carbon:carbon (RCC) composite materials to RCC or to refractory metals such as tantalum or niobium. In the proposed effort MRi and Exotherm will produce nano-phase particles of two candidate precursor materials (Ti-Si-C-based and WO3-Al-Zr-SiO2), demonstrate their exothermic properties, make RCC/RCC and RCC/(Nb or)Ta joints, characterize the joints and run lap shear strength\r\n\r\nThe goal is to advance innovative, cost effective and reliable joining processes that would enable the in-flight repair of space shuttle or other reentry vehicles structures where RCC is being used. Although RCC structure repair is the specific application that is targeted, exothermic brazing technology would offer opportunity in the assembly of structures in space and on interplanetary missions, where high-energy heat sources would be difficult or impossible to use for in-flight joining, assembly and/or repair.",
