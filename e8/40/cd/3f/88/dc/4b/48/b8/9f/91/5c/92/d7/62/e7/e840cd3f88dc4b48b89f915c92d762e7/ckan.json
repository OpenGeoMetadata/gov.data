  "notes": "There is a well-documented history of disturbance and contamination from previous activities on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. In April 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a formal process to remove/modify a CERCLA land use restriction to allow the refuge to manage its bison herd similar to other bison herds across the country, which would include removing surplus bison from the site. Bison were sampled for organochlorine pesticides and mercury. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was created from a former Department of Defense installation. There is a well-documented history of disturbance and contamination from previous activities on this site. In April 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a formal process to remove/modify a CERCLA land use restriction to allow the refuge to manage its bison herd similar to other bison herds across the country, which would include removing surplus bison from the site. To remove/ modify this restriction, defensible data is needed to support a risk determination demonstrating that there is not an unacceptable risk from consumption of refuge bison. Sample design was based on the pharmocokinetics of organochlorine pesticdes, especially dieldrin. Samples were collected from both sexes and a wide range of ages. All animals tested were born or have spent the majority of their lives on the Refuge. A goal was to create a method to sampe bison tissue from live animals. Such a method would provide a relatively cost-effective surveillance technique to allow detection of any contaminants without sacrificing animals. In addition, a set of samples was provided to the USDA Food Inspection Service for testing under their methods.In 2014 and 2015, 112 tissue samples collected from necropsies were analyzed to support risk-based site-specific assessment. Only one sample yielded a dieldrin detection. Dieldrin is known to accumulate in fat tissue and this detection (21 ppb) was found in tail-head fat tissue. This detection in fat and not in other tissues within the animal further confirms the lipophilic nature of these chemicals. Even with the reported dieldrin concentrations in fat in this single detection, bison meat samples have very low fat content (2%), so the dieldrin concentrations in meat from this animal were well below site-specific screening levels for organochlorine pesticide residues. This result is also consistent with the USDA analysis, although the USDA detection levels were not as low as for this study.Inorganic mercury is known to accumulate in kidneys. A total of 10 animals had low mercury concentrations (0.02 â€“ 0.03 mg/kg) in kidney. These low levels of mercury are consistent with the low soil concentrations of mercury in RMA surface soils and with what is known about demethylation in the digestive organs of ungulates. In addition, inorganic mercury is poorly absorbed from plants so it is rarely detected in meat. The EPA has adopted a standard for methylmercury in fish (30 ppb) as well as a FDA action level (1.0 ppm). No standards exist for inorganic mercury in terrestrial biota.It appears current bison grazing activities on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge do not result in animals encountering contaminants that could present any risk to humans through direct consumption. Analysis of samples collected from multiple tissues and organs during the necropsy of eighteen animals reaffirms past studies demonstrating that even extremely low levels of contaminants are not present in potentially edible tissue. This information can be utilized to complete required data summary and evaluation reports to support a change in the CERCLA land use restriction affecting possible consumption of refuge bison. Data may also be used in combination with existing information on the site to support: (1) elimination of further sampling for mercury in bison; and (2) the decision to proceed with a surveillance program as bison experien",
