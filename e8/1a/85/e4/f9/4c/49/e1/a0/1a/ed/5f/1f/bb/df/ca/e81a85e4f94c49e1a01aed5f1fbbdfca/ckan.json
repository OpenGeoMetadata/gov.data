    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to develop a novel compact, efficient and high-temperature power module, based on unique co-packaging approach of normally-off silicon (Si) MOSFET with silicon carbide (SiC) normally-on power JFET in a cascode configuration. A much desired silicon MOS gate control is provided readily compatible with the conventional gate drivers, making a proposed module a plug-in replacement for conventional Si IGBT modules offering smaller size and higher power density, lower conduction and switching losses, and higher operating temperature for a wide range of civilian, aerospace and military applications, where compact power converters are needed with minimum cooling requirements.\r\nThe proposed hybrid Si/SiC cascode approach offers substantial improvement in module power density, by up to 50&#37;, with unique packaging approach, greatly reduced size of a power switch, and elimination of separate antiparallel diode, which is replaced with an intrinsically fast and efficient body diode of a low-voltage Si MOSFET. Significant reduction in static and dynamic power losses compared to Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs are achieved by utilization of a fast switched normally-on SiC JFET with ultra-low on-resistance and hence much lower static and dynamic losses than state-of-the-art Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs.\r\nIt is hard to understate the need for compact power converters in aerospace applications, where the allowed on-board space and the weight for the power management systems are very limited. The proposed cascode power module will also enable circuit designers to provide significantly smaller, more reliable, more efficient and lower cost solutions for more mainstream applications such as power factor correction circuits, photovoltaic micro-inverters, power supplies, motors &amp; pump drives, industrial power converters, and consumer appliances\r\n.",
