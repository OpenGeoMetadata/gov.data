  "notes": "The astronomical high tide line was compiled from National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) 1:24,000-scale habitat maps that were photo-interpreted from color-infrared aerial photography acquired between November 1988 and March 1989 at a scale of 1:65,000. Inland extent of tidal influence was then determined from the 1988 Chabreck and Linscombe marsh vegetation maps, photo-interpretation, field review, and information gathered from discussions with regional and local experts. Only semi-diurnal and diurnal gravity tides are considered in the NWI classification because of the general lack of information on wind-influenced tidal fluctuations and ranges. All saltwater wetlands (saline, brackish, and intermediate) in coastal Louisiana were considered to be tidal unless impounded, and tidally influenced freshwater wetlands were included in the tidal zone as well. In general, the division between salt water and fresh water is considered to be the limit of gravitation tidal influence for coastal Louisiana. Arcs that close delineate isolated areas above the astronomical high tide line, but are not built into topological polygons.",
