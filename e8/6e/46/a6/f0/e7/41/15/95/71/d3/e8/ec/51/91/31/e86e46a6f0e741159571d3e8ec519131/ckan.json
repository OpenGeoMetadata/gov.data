The focus of this program is to evaluate the stratigraphic trap potential and reservoir quality of coal-bearing Cenozoic strata in upper Cook Inlet basin and the reservoir quality of Mesozoic strata throughout the basin. The samples included in this report were collected in the Tyonek, Kenai, and Seldovia Quadrangles from September 2006 through July 2010. All samples in this report were processed by Russ Harms in Medicine Toenail Alberta, Canada. Prepared slides of recovered palynomorphs were analyzed by Dr. Pierre Zippi (Biostratigraphy.com, LLC). Sample collectors include Paul Decker (DOG), Emily Finzel (Purdue University); Bob Gillis (DGGS), Trystan Herriott (DGGS), Dave LePain (DGGS), Dave Mauel (DGGS), Jacob Mongrain (UAF and DGGS), and Marwan Wartes (DGGS).",
