    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose that the Membrane Aperture Shell Technology (MAST) approach be expanded with a specific focus on space exploration orbiting comm network RF aperture applications.  The approach is based on a proven combination of 1) thin film materials with space heritage, 2) inherent low areal density (40 to 200 g/m2), 3) structural shell stiffness provided through the induction of permanent curvature, 4) sufficiently low surface roughness and thickness variation (verging on optical grade), and global figure to satisfy all RF wavelength operations, 5) proven  RF reflectivity, 6) compact stack or roll stowage, 7) robust passive self deployment with stowed strain energy, and when needed, 8) compatibility with boundary control/adjustment to provide initial phasing, rigid body fine pointing and environmental disturbance effect rejection.  Recent advances in shell fabrication technology enable easily scaleable aperture systems based on hexagons segments.  By optimizing local segment figure and alignment large scale on axis (or even off axis) parabolas can be adequately approximated.  In the PI we will demonstrate fabrication of suitable hexagon shaped segments, determine optimal system architectures, confirm RF performance, numerically show sufficient stiffness in the face of environmental and launch loads, review figure mitigation and control techniques. This prepares the way for a detailed PII focused on demonstrating performance in realistic environments (TRL 6), a key step in any realistic commercialization plan for space hardware.",
