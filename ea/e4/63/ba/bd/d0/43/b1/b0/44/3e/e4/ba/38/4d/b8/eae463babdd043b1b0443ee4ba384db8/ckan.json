The map focuses primarily on agricultural land-use: crop and pasture lands. The maps consist of a broad based inventory of land-use and land-cover. Map categories fall with 6 broad \"Level 1\" categories: water, forest, barren, herbaceous, agricultural lands, and urban. Specific Level 1 land-use categories: agriculture and urban are broken into more discrete, \"Level 2\" land-use subcategories: e.g. crop type, pasture type.
