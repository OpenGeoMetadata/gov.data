  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides for the analytical thermal design and analysis of any spacecraft. This includes conceptual design, analytical thermal model development, definition of requirements, worst-case environments and design conditions, and temperature predictions for all cases. The facility provides the means to turn an &amp;quot;analytical thermal design&amp;quot; into a working temperature control subsystem ready for flight-i.e., provides the means to go from design and analysis to hardware qualification and acceptance testing and then to orbit. DESCRIPTION: This facility provides computer support to accommodate six thermal analysts. The software required to create and run analytical thermal models includes TRASYS/TSS and Thermal Desktop for radiation exchange and orbital flux determination, and SINDA/FLUINT for thermal model formation and temperature prediction. Thermo-optical surface properties of &amp;quot; real&amp;quot; surfaces must be known accurately for reliable temperature prediction. Thus, two types of reflectometers are used to measure short wavelengths for solar absorptions and long-wave infrared for room-temperature emittance. Detailed thermal design and analysis are followed by fabrication and test phases. Capabilities within the facility include fabrication, assembly, and qualification of flight hardware, and flight support. Technicians have expertise in the manipulation of all contemporary and advanced thermal control hardware including, but not limited to, multilayer insulation materials (for thermal blankets) and flight-qualified temperature sensors, thermostats, and heaters. This facility is capable of and has supported the incorporation of specialty technologies such as &amp;#8226; Cryogenic thermal blankets and cryo coolers; &amp;#8226; Diode, loop, constant, and variable conductance heat pipes; and &amp;#8226; Capillary pumped loops and other advanced two-phase systems. INSTRUMENTATION: A computerized data acquisition and control system (CDACS) is used during thermal testing for the display, collection, storage, and retrieval of temperature and power data, and for the automated control of all power supplies that feed various simulation heaters. The CDACS consists of &amp;#8226; Two workstations with displays; &amp;#8226; Signal conditioners for over 1,000 thermocouple and low-voltage inputs; and &amp;#8226; 40 rack-mounted, digital power supplies with appropriate bus connectivity for output control.
