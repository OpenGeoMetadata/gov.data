  "notes": "'Cwilocs_nps' is a shapefile of well locations created from wells listed in the Minnesota Geological Survey's County Well Index (CWI) data base. Specifically, this coverage contains wells for which the locations have been verified by the Minnesota Geological Survey, the Minnesota Department of Health, or another agency, and a well location has been obtained either by digitizing the location from a USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle map, by field survey, or by GPS location. Attribute information about the wells includes key fields from County Well Index, including owner name, use type, location, aquifer, and water levels. Additional descriptive information about the wells is found in the full County Well Index data set. The information in County Well Index was entered by the Minnesota Geological Survey from the Water Well Driller Log form, which was submitted by the well driller to the Minnesota Department of Health at the time the well was constructed. Submission of a Water Well Driller Log is a requirement of the Minnesota Water Well Construction Code, passed by the State Legislature in 1974. While the County Well Index does not represent all wells in the state, it is the single most complete listing of wells. Accuracy and completeness of CWI are discussed elsewhere in this document.",
