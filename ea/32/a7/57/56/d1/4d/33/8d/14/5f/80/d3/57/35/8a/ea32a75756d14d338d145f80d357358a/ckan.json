  "notes": "This is one of several important historical documents associated with remediation activities at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge was once of 13 nuclear weapons production facilities in the United States during the Cold War and was managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The plant operated from 1952 to 1994 with manufacturing activities taking place in the center portion of the site with a large buffer zone around the area. In 1989, nuclear production work stopped to address environmental and safety concerns. Although work resumed in 1990, the mission was terminated when President George H. W. Bush canceled the W-88 Trident Warhead program in 1992. Nuclear and nonnuclear production stopped in 1993, and in 1994 the last shipment of defense-related materials was sent off-site.When the facility’s mission changed from production to cleanup and closure, it was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). The site was added to the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List (Superfund List) in 1989. With oversight from the EPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE), the DOE completed the $7 billion dollar cleanup in 2005. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 (Pub.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1379, enacted December 8, 2001), mandated that once remediation was complete the site would become a national wildlife refuge. The refuge was officially established in 2007. This document presents the selected corrective actions/remedial actions for the Peripheral OU and the Central OU at Rocky Flats. These actions were chosen in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. The selected remedies/corrective actions were also chosen in accordance with the Colorado Hazardous Waste Act. The selected remedy/corrective action for the Peripheral OU attains the mandates of CERCLA Section 121, and to the extent practicable, the NCP. The selected remedy for the Peripheral OU is protective of human health and the environment, complies with applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements, and is cost-effective. The selected remedy/corrective action complies with applicable requirements of the CHWA. No accelerated actions were taken in the Peripheral OU, and no remedial action alternatives were evaluated for the Peripheral OU. Because no hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants occur in the Peripheral OU above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, a five-year review will not be required for the selected remedy/corrective action in the Peripheral OU.",
