  "notes": "A review, of the exotic ungulate industry in Florida was made by mailing  questionnaires to exotic ungulate permittees, phone interviews, interviews with  exotic ungulate owner/managers, interviews with law enforcement wildlife  inspectors, review of permit application forms on file with the Florida Game and  Fresh Water Fish Commission, and review of the International Species Inventory System list. There were 3,649 wildlife exhibits, game farms, and hunting preserves in Florida. All of these are intensively managed pen operations where there is relatively little contact between exotic and native ungulates. Of these, 64 (2%) maintained a total of more than 6,000 exotic hoofed-animals representing 103 species. The number of new game farms with exotic ungulates has increased dramatically in the past 10 to 15 years. The most common species are fallow (Cervus dama), axis (C. axis}, and sika (C. nippon) deer. These species have been shown to compete with native white-tailed deer in other states. The potential for competition probably is not as great in Florida. Florida has more of an abundance and diversity of vegetation types than most other states; therefore, even slight differences in food selection or habitat preferences would lessen competition between species. The biggest concern is the potential for introduction of diseases and parasites along with the exotic ungulates. Although there is not a market for the meat of exotic ungulates in Florida at this time, these animals are a potential source of high protein and low fat meat. Exotic ungulate operations in Florida provide additional income to some landowners, year-around hunting opportunity, preservation of threatened and endangered species, and non-consumptive recreational opportunities. The exotic ungulate industry needs to be monitored closely in the coming years, particularly with regards to diseases and parasites.",
