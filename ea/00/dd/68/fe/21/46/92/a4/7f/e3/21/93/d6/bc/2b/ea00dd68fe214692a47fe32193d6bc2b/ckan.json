    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project focuses on providing an infrastructure to aid the building\nof ontologies from existing NASA applications, in a manner that leads to\nlong-term risk reduction. Currently numerous stove-pipe systems are in\nexistence in the ISS (International Space Station) and Space Shuttle\nProgram (SSP) which need to be integrated for studying the operational\ntrade-offs through various risk-analysis tools. However, knowledge\ninside and across such systems has to be captured in ontologies for such\nsystems, at appropriate abstraction levels and in a reliable manner, so\nthat they can be analyzed holistically by existing tools. Based on our\nexperience in using a clustering approach for analyzing knowledge bases\nfrom both NASA and non-NASA systems, we propose to build a semantic\nmediation toolkit that focuses on providing various types of ontological\nengineering aids during knowledge entry, leading to long-term quality\nassurance and interoperability of NASA systems. In Phase I of this\nproject, the feasibility of applying Pragatiys MVP-CA methodology on a\ncandidate system relevant to NASA will be demonstrated. In particular we\nwill demonstrate feasibility of automating detection of ontological\nconcepts, quality assurance issues and mapping and merging of concepts\nfrom NASA systems so as to lead to long-term risk reduction. The\nultimate aim of the project is to reduce the risks involved in utilizing\nontologies built for NASA systems.",
