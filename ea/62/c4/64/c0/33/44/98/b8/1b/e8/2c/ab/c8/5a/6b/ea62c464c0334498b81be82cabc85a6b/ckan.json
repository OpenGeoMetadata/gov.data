  "notes": "The IT Performance Dashboard is a trusted source for IT performance information across VA. This is available only on the VA intranet.  The dashboard is a collection of information from Regions, VISNs, Facilities, and other VA offices across a range of departments within the Office of Information & Technology (OIT)ï¿½from Product Development and Information Security to Human Resources to Finance. It presents often-complex information in easy-to-understand dashboard reports.\r\nCurrently, you can see performance reports relating to Customer Service, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Systems, Monthly Performance Reports (MPR), IT Assets and Debt Score, Human Resources, and Network/Security. There is also a Facility CIO Center tab where you can see Quarterly Performance Reviews, an OIT Daily Brief tab where you can access OIT Daily Brief Reports, and a Product Delivery tab that takes you to the PMAS Dashboard. As the IT Performance Dashboard continues to evolve, you will be able to see a broader range of performance information ï¿½ including custom reports, upon request.\r\nThis page displays Customers Service Dashboard Reports on the IT Dashboard:\r\nï¿½\tAmerican Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) by # of Facilities:  This report captures the number of participating VA facilities within the range of American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) scores from 40-100. Only facilities which have 35 or more respondents are included. Clicking on any of the bars on the chart will enable the user to drill down and view the facilities that fall within that range.\r\nï¿½\tAmerican Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) by Administration:  This report captures the ACSI scores (IT customer satisfaction levels) of the Administrations from the three most recent national VA IT customer satisfaction surveys. For each Administration, the ACSI values from the three surveys are set side-by-side for a high-level performance comparison.\r\nï¿½\tAverage Speed of Answers per Region ï¿½ (last  6 months):  This report captures the average wait time for a call to be answered, including times where the call was answered immediately. Clicking on any of the lines on the chart denoting Regions will enable the user to drill down and view the Campus level data.\r\nï¿½\tOverall First Contact Resolution for All Regions ï¿½ (last 6 months):  This report displays the First Contact Resolution Rate which is defined as a ticket being opened, resolved and closed by the same OIT entity that received the initial contact. Clicking on any of the lines on the chart denoting Regions will enable the user to drill down and view the Campus level data.",
