The subject file represents the Arkansas portion of power line routes derived from 1:100,000-scale (\"\"intermediate-scale\"\") Digital Line Graph data created by the USGS. Digital Line Graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources. Intermediate-scale DLG data are derived from USGS 1:100,000-scale 30- by 60-minute quadrangle maps. If these maps are not available, Bureau of Land Management planimetric maps at a scale of 1:100,000 are used. Intermediate-scale DLG's are broken down into five categories: 1. Public Land survey, 2. boundaries, 3. transportation 4. hydrography, and 5. hypsography.",
