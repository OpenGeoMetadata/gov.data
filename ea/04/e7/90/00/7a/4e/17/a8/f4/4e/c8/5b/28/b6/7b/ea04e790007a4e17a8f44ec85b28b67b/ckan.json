  "notes": "This is a region dataset delineating the areas of offshore Louisiana having Regional Response Team VI (RRT 6) pre-approval for the use of in-situ burning, according to the RRT VI In-Situ Burn Plan, to remediate the effects of an oil spill. This preapproval area is defined as 'seaward of three (nautical) miles (from) the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, with areas excluded offshore in the vicinity of certain reefs and an area off Grand Isle Louisiana.' Three nautical miles from the nearest shoreline for Louisiana corresponds to the state's territorial limits. For the purposes of defining a seaward limit to this data set, the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary, at a nominal 200 nautical miles from the shore, was used. This data set is bounded on the west by the Galveston Marine Safety Office zone and on the east by the Mobile Marine Safety Office zone.",
