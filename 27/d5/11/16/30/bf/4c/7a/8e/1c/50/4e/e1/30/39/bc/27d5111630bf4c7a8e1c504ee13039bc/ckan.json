    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Reliable diagnostic tools to support system health monitoring are critical both for liquid rocket experimental ground test facilities and flight systems.  Here, flow induced instabilities can generate flow anomalies such as large scale pressure fluctuations that may couple with other system components and generate deleterious structural vibrations or lead to system malfunction as was evidenced in the RS-68 engine on the Delta IV system.  Identifying the source of these flow  instabilities is extremely difficult since they may arise from a variety of coupled phenomena such as hydrodynamics, valve timing and scheduling, and cavitation related events in cryogenic propellant and oxidizer feedlines.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed Phase II program addresses this deficiency; the product of this effort will be a reliable predictive tool that can characterize flow instabilities, identify dominant frequency modes, and  elucidate structural response in valve and feed systems.  Phase I activities demonstrated the simulation capability for instabilities in varied flow devices (e.g.  venturis, orifices)  used in the E-1 test facilities at NASA SSC. The Phase II work will extend this to include fluid-structure interaction for analysis of system vibration, structural damage and gauge valve response.  Extensive validation will result in a predictive diagnostic tool for liquid rocket propulsion systems.",
