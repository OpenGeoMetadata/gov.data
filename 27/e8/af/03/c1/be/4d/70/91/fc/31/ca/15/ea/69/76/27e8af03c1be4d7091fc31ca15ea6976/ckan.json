    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan  \n                                    satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation   and to\n                                    estimate its associated latent heating.\n                                    \n                                    The primary objective of the 2A21 is to compute the path integrated\n                                    attenuation (PIA), using the surface reference technique (SRT).  The\n                                    SRT relies on the assumption that the difference between the\n                                    measurements of the normalized surface cross section within and\n                                    outside the rain provides a measure of the PIA.\n                                    \n                                    Two types of non-rain surface cross section (sigma-zero) reference\n                                    estimates are used: spatial and temporal.  In the spatial surface\n                                    reference data set, the mean and standard deviation of the surface\n                                    cross sections are calculated over a running window of Ns fields of\n                                    view before rain is encountered.  These operations are performed\n                                    separately for each of the 49+2 incidence angles of TRMM\n                                    (corresponding to the cross-track scan from -17 degrees to + 17\n                                    degrees with respect to nadir).  The two additional angle bins (making\n                                    the total 51 rather than 49) are to account for non-zero pitch/roll\n                                    angles that can shift the incidence angle with respect to nadir\n                                    outside the normal range.\n                                    \n                                    For the temporal surface reference data set, the running mean and\n                                    standard deviation are computed over a 1 degree x 1 degree (latitude,\n                                    longitude) grid.  Within each 1 degree x 1 degree grid cell, the data\n                                    are further categorized into incidence angle categories (26).  The\n                                    number of observations in each category, Nt, are also recorded.  Note\n                                    that, for the temporal reference data set, no distinction is made\n                                    between the port and starboard incidence angles.  So, instead of 49\n                                    incidence angles, there are only 25 + 1, where the additional bin\n                                    corresponds to angles greater than the normal range.\n                                    \n                                    When rain is encountered, the mean and standard deviations of the\n                                    reference sigma-zero values are retrieved from the spatial and\n                                    temporal surface reference data sets.  To determine which reference\n                                    measurement is to be used, the algorithm checks whether Nt >= Ntmin\n                                    and Ns >= Nsmin, where Ntmin and Nsmin are the minimum number of\n                                    samples that are needed to be considered a valid reference estimate\n                                    for the temporal and spatial reference data sets, respectively.\n                                    (Presently, Ntmin = 50 and Nsmin = 8).  If neither condition is\n                                    satisfied, no estimate of the PIA is made and the flags are set\n                                    accordingly.  If only one condition is met, then the surface reference\n                                    data which corresponds to this is used.  If...",
