  "notes": "  Research Area: Chiropractic  Program:Developmental Centers for Research on CAM  Description:The purpose of this Developmental Center is to build our expertise in clinical research and to serve as the focal point to strengthen and enhance our established and evolving relationships with conventional institutions and thereby facilitate three synergistic and novel research projects. The central scientific theme is to evaluate non-rotary chiropractic spinal manipulation (SM) for cervical spine and related dysfunctions. The long range importance of this approach is that it provides valuable information for understanding the appropriate clinical role of spinal manipulation in our evolving health care system. We will also contribute to the development of models for the rigorous conduct of clinical and translational research involving manipulative techniques. Project 1 is a phase II study looking at the effect of upper cervical manipulation techniques in lowering blood pressure in patients with Stage I hypertension. Project 2 is a study investigating the effect of a mechanically assisted manipulative technique used for treating temporomandibular disorder. Project 3 is a study to develop and evaluate a sham manipulation in the cervical spine using both a clinical and a biomechanical component. Investigators will use pilot data to submit competitive grant applications to NIH, and will provide research training experiences for future CAM investigators. The ultimate goal of this Center is to create a translational research program inchiropractic.  ",
