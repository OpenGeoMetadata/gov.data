  "notes": "In the late 1960s, severe reproductive impairments were reported for nesting colonies of the California brown pelican (Pelicanus occidentalus californicus) in the Southern California Bight.  In 1970, West Anacapa Island (WAI) was home to the last active colony in the California portion of the Southern California Bight (SCB), and that colony produced as few as 1 fledgling from 552 nest attempts.  The low fledging rate was due to poor hatch rates caused by eggshell thinning and breakage of eggs.  Eggshell thinning and possibly other impairments were attributed to exposure to organochlorine (OC) compounds, primarily DDE (a breakdown product of the pesticide DDT), and PCBs discharged into coastal waters and accumulated in the tissues of fish consumed by pelicans.  Data on eggs collected between 1970 and 1992 indicate that exposure by WAI pelicans to OC pesticides and PCBs started to decline in the 1970s when uses of many OC compounds in the United States were either curtailed or banned.  There were also corresponding increases in eggshell thickness and overall productivity of the WAI pelican colony.  Data on contaminant exposure by WAI pelicans had not been collected since 1992, when although thicker, eggshells still exhibited some thinning, concentrations of DDE in individual eggs still exceeded thresholds for crushing, and nest productivity was still below what was expected. This study was conducted to update the data on contaminant exposure by WAI pelicans, and to evaluate temporal trends and the potential role of contaminants as a limiting factor for productivity in the WAI colony.",
