    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA seeks to develop high specific energy primary batteries that are safe and capable of performing under a wide temperature range, for manned space missions. To meet this goal, CFX Battery Inc. proposes to develop, characterize, and establish technological feasibility of a new Li/SF-CFx based high capacity lithium primary battery that offers higher rate capability and enhanced safety than conventional Li/CFx primary systems. In Phase I of the project, CFX Battery will develop the sub-fluorinated CFx cathode materials that offer high capacity (&gt;700 mAh/g) and rate capability. In addition, novel non-flammable electrolytes that are highly conductive and electrochemically stable at a wide temperature range will be developed to increase the safety of the Li/SF-CFx system. The technological feasibility of the sub-fluorinated CFx cathode and non-flammable electrolyte combination will be demonstrated using small coin and pouch cells. Phase II of the project will implement the developed technology in large cell formats and perform any refinement and optimization that will be needed to bring the technology to a commercially usable stage.\r\n\r\n",
