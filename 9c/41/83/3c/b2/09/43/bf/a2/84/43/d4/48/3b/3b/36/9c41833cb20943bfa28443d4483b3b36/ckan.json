    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;The replacement of hexavalent chrome [Cr (VI)] in the processing of aluminum for high-reliability electronics applications in the aviation and aerospace sector remains a goal of great significance.&amp;nbsp; Aluminum is the major structural manufacturing material used for avionics type packages both the aircraft (military and commercial) and space flight arena.&amp;nbsp; The processing and maintenance of this material against degradation and corrosion is of prime importance to the electronics community in preserving our defense and space operations capabilities.&amp;nbsp; This includes preserving the integrity of the structure and electronics components within, maintaining proper electrical conductivity, and minimizing impact on radio and electromagnetic interference qualities of the electronics package.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the operability and preservation of aluminum substrates for electronic housings and avionics has been the use of chromated coatings, typically conversion coatings on interior spaces and coating systems (conversion coatings, primers) for exteriors and sometimes hard-chrome plating. Hard chrome plating on components is accomplished through an electrochemical process; the electrochemically adhered chrome provides barrier protection to the substrate by forming a dense self-healing oxide layer on the surface.&amp;nbsp; Though some electronics applications may use hard-chrome plating, it is outside of the scope of this project.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, with applied coatings, the high corrosion resistance offered by chromated films is attributed to the presence of both hexavalent and trivalent chromium in the coating.&amp;nbsp; The trivalent chromium is present as an insoluble hydrated oxide, whereas the hexavalent chromium imparts a &amp;ldquo;self-healing&amp;rdquo; character to the coating during oxidative (corrosive) attack.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chrome coatings also play a critical role in supporting and enhancing the adhesion of the primer coating to the substrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) studies have determined that hexavalent chromium poses significant medical risks to users.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chromium is considered a potential lung carcinogen.&amp;nbsp; Studies of workers in the chromate production, plating, and pigment industries consistently show increased rates of lung cancer.&amp;nbsp; It has also been shown that direct eye contact with chromic acid or chromate dusts can cause permanent eye damage.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chromium can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs and repeated or prolonged exposure can damage the mucous membranes of the nasal passages and result in ulcers.&amp;nbsp; In severe cases, exposure causes perforation of the septum (the wall separating the nasal passages).&amp;nbsp; It has also been proven that prolonged skin contact can result in dermatitis and skin ulcers. Some workers develop an allergic sensitization to chromium and kidney damage has been linked to high levels of dermal exposures.&lt;/p&gt;",
