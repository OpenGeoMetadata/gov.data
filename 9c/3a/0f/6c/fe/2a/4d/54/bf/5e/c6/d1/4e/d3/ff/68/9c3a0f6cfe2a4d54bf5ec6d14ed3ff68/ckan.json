The data are available in two formats. The first used a detailed genus-level classification scheme and was used to classify Mississippi River Navigation Pools 4 through 26, the Open River between Grand Tower and River Mile 32, and the Peoria navigation Pool on the Illinois River. The second classification scheme was developed in 1998 in response to a scientific and programmatic review of the center's mapping projects. This classification scheme identifies plant communities and associations. This second classification scheme was used to interpret data for Mississippi River Pools 1 through 3, the Open River between Lock and Dam 26 and Grand Tower, and the Alton, Starved Rock, Marseilles, Brandon, Dresden, and Lockport navigation pools on the Illinois River. At the time this metadata document was prepared data classified underneath the first classification scheme were being cross-walked to the new scheme. This metadata document has been prepared to document the second classification scheme.",
