    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "HIRMLS3IWC is the Joint EOS High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) monthly 10 deg lat x 20 deg lon gridded product for ice water content (IWC) data. This is version 2 released to the public, with the original input coming from v3.3 MLS and v7 HIRDLS. The grid spatial coverage is near-global (-80 deg to +90 deg latitude). The product contains HIRDLS and MLS IWC data for the time of the HIRDLS mission from February 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The vertical range of the data is from 215 to 82 hPa for both HIRDLS and MLS, and the vertical resolution is about 1.5 km for HIRDLS and 3 km for MLS. Users of the HIRMLS3IWC data product should read the Version 2 HIRDLS-MLS Level 3 IWC Data Description and Quality document for more information\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5), which is based on the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format, or HDF5. The data file contains two grid objects (one with HIRDLS data, the other with MLS data), each with a set of data fields, attributes, and metadata. Each grid contains data fields with IWC values, and the HIRDLS grid includes data fields with volume density, cloud top pressure and frequency of clouds. Time, latitude and vertical pressure information are also included in each grid.\n\nParameters contained in the data files include the following:\nVariable Name|Description|Units\nIWC|Ice Water Content|g/m3\nEnd of parameter information",
