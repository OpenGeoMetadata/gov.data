    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "High-temperature passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors are highly desirable for improving safety and efficiency in aviation and space vehicles. This proposal addresses the growth and processing of a new class of high temperature material into acceptable SAW wafers, the production of SAW temperature sensors, and the integration of the SAW and thin film antenna (SAWtenna).  \r\nThe project will provide a new, unique material grown in the US (no other US manufacturer is known, produce high temperature, radiation hard, solid state, passive wireless sensors for use in harsh environments. In this project, we will:\r\n\r\n1) Develop a crystal material for SAW wafers suitable for high-temperature SAW fabrication.\r\n2) Design orthogonally frequency coded OFC (up to 1000 degrees C) SAW temperature sensors .\r\n3) Integrate the SAW and antenna onto the wafer such that there are no external connections. \r\n\t   \r\nIn Phase I the capability for the production of LGT crystals was established and 2in diameter boules were grown. The crystals were processed into SAW wafers and confirmed to be of excellent quality, as evidenced from SAW parameters extraction.  A thin film process using simple metallization demonstrated extended device operation at 700 oC and short-term operation at 800 oC. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of high-temperature SAW devices, and a clear path in the Phase II effort for 1000 oC device operation. During Phase II, we will explore variations of the metallization and encapsulation, which will extend device life.  SAW OFC high temperature sensors, operating in the 915 ISM band, will operate simultaneously over temperature and will be delivered to NASA.  \r\nPhase II will develop a fully integrated sensor antenna and upscale the crystal growth for 3-4in SAW wafers. Probability for Phase III commercialization of both the wireless SAW sensors and SAW wafers is very high.",
