    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advanced microcontrollers having digital signal processing features have enabled the capability to distribute on-board computation for remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).  Distributed processing can result in a lighter weight avionics suite with improved performance, by locating data conversion units adjacent to the sensors and control actuators, and reducing EMI through minimization of the amount of interconnection wiring.  The proposed work will leverage CDI's and AMDI's substantial prior experience in the development and operation of flight control avionics for ROVs in the design of a new system for supporting advanced research using these systems.  The avionics suite to be developed consists of serially interconnected distributed nodes that may be programmed through a Matlab graphical interface to perform control and sensing functions in support of custom requirements from the research community.  The flexibility of custom-configured distributed computing nodes for use in a research context ensures that \"just enough\" instrumentation and control is provided for the specific test requirements at hand.  Phase I will provide risk reduction by demonstrating the operation of the subcomponent technologies, culminating in a simplified flight test of the avionics system.  Phase II continuation will develop the complete system to support testing activities at a NASA research center of interest.",
