    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Through this Phase I program, Agiltron has successfully produced an innovative transparent conductive nanocomposite paint that holds the promise of meeting space application requirements.   The paint can be easily applied to many surfaces and forms a clear conductive coating at temperatures as low as 130 &lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.    These coatings exhibit high visible transparency of ~ 85 &#37; (&gt; 95&#37; with additional AR coating) and good conductive sheet resistance in the range of 106  to 108 ohm/sq.  Agiltron has also performed harsh environmental testing in which the coatings show no degradation after undergoing UV radiation up to 32 J/cm2 irradiation, low temperature cycling down to 77 oK, high vacuum pumping, and collision with fragmented debris. The proposed robust clear conductive coating is therefore well suited for NASA space environment resistant polymer coating related applications.  The high performance paint will also find wide commercial applications, such as in flexible displays.  In Phase II, we will continue these efforts through a concentration on optimization and scale-up of stable ITO/polymer suspensions and the development of low-cost, large-scale deposition and patterning processes for the practical applications of this new class of transparent conductive coatings.",
