EDNA's 3D hydrologic layers are vertically consistent by their very nature, meaning that hydrologic drainage always flows from a higher elevation to a lower elevation and that reach catchment boundaries always follow the elevation drainage divide. This consistency allows for transfer of valuable information from digital elevation models onto EDNA-derived drainage lines and watersheds, including stream gradient, minimum and maximum elevation within a watershed, average watershed slope, and elevation.",
