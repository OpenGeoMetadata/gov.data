    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Recovery of water from brine is critically important for manned space\nexploration.  Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for extended\nmissions.  It is anticipated that NASA will pool urine, hygiene water\nand humidity condensate into a combined waste stream that will\nsubsequently be concentrated into a brine while recovering some but not\nall of the water, 90-95&amp;#37;.  The concentrated brine that results from\nprimary water recovery systems contains a significant amount of water.\nThe proposed innovation will recover virtually all of the remaining\nwater.  This will be accomplished by ultrasonically creating nebulized\ndroplets of the brine that can be readily dried under a partial vacuum\nwith moderate temperature microwave heating.  The process bears some\nresemblance to spray drying, but uses much smaller droplets (1.6 m as\ncompared to ~100 m).  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their\nhigh relative surface area.  This is particularly important when drying\nwastewater brines which contain ingredients that are thermally labile\nand require drying at relatively low temperatures.  The proposed system\nhas no nozzles to become plugged, requires no chemical additives, uses a\nminimal amount of power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut\nattention and uses a continuous, closed cycle process that is gravity independent.",
