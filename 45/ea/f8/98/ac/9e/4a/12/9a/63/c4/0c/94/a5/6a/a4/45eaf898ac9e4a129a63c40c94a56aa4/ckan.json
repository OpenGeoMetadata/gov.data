  "notes": "To better understand potential responses of subalpine forests to future climatic variability and change, we studied the effects of interannual and interdecadal climatic variability on radial growth of a subalpine conifer, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), at 31 sites spanning the latitudinal and elevational ranges of the species in the Pacific Northwest. Factor analysis identified three common patterns of interannual growth variability that displayed spatial coherence with respect to latitudinal and elevational gradients and were correlated with climatic variability. The first growth pattern was common to most upper and middle elevation sites in Washington and northern Oregon, and reflected the negative influence of deep snowpack, late snowmelt, and cool summer temperatures on growth. The second growth pattern, associated with chronologies from the southern Oregon Cascades, showed a negative growth response to spring snowpack and a negative growth response to warm, dry summer conditions. The third common growth pattern, shared by several low elevation chronologies, appeared to track annual and multiyear variations in fall and winter precipitation. Decadal-scale variations in the first and third growth patterns tracked decadal oscillations in spring snowpack depth and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), an index of spatial patterns of sea surface temperatures in the northern Pacific Ocean. Periods with warmer winters and reduced snowpack, associated with the warm phase of the PDO, produced above-average growth at most high and middle elevation locations and below-average growth at several low elevation sites. Regional climate models predict warmer winter and summer temperatures in the Pacific Northwest in the next century in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, with decreased snow accumulations. Our study suggests that such changes would have a positive effect on tree growth and productivity in most mountain hemlock forests in Washington and northern Oregon. Increased summer drought stress and reduced productivity is likely, however, in some mountain hemlock stands near the current lower limit of the species elevational range and on southern Oregon sites with coarse-textured soils.",
