    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The main objective of this proposal is to perform a feasibility study for the use of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) as the provider of communication services for NASA aircrafts. The feasibility study will lead us to the end goal of defining an airplane communication system architecture through TDRSS. The driver of this effort is to reduce costs of airborne missions and improve communication&amp;rsquo;s reliability. The NASA Airborne Science Program is an important part of the Earth Sciences Division within the Science Mission Directorate that provides &amp;ldquo;aircraft systems that further science and advance the use of satellite data&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It includes aircraft, e.g. the Wallops P3, and Dryden ER-2 and Global Hawk, with instruments that continue to advance the science achieved from these platforms, used by investigators from NASA, other government agencies and universities.&amp;nbsp; Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a successful history of airborne scientific instruments, for example the ER-2 Doppler Radar (EDOP), Cloud Radar System (CRS), the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL), Conical Scanning Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (CoSMIR), and others that have provided advances in cloud and precipitation remote sensing. The aircraft program also provides an avenue to test and fly instruments that can later be extended for observations from space. It is then logical to assume that as science advances, and higher data rates are desired for observations from space, this translates into the need for higher data rate communications from aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASA aircraft platforms vary in the altitudes they can achieve, hence different communication needs are likely to exist. This study will look into trades including: available TDRSS services, required coverage, required data rates, communication links, communication frequency comparison (S vs. Ku vs. Ka-bands), and spectrum requirements. The end goal is to make a recommendation for the on-board communications system architecture to communicate airborne science data through TDRSS. This architecture would include recommendations on information data frames and packet formats to meet the existing infrastructure, modulation selection, number of instruments that can communicate through this architecture, and comm. subsystem hardware, including the antenna needed to meet the required links for tracking TDRSS. As part of this study, we would evaluate if one solution could exist that would be feasible for all NASA aircraft platforms. In addition, we would investigate the use of TDRSS in the Long Duration Balloon Program, which currently uses S-band TDRSS Services, and developments done for communications of sounding rockets. In the future, the process and savings outlined by achieving a NASA TDRSS Service for other platforms could be presented to the Global Hawk Operation offices for primary or secondary (backup) communications.&lt;/p&gt;",
