    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a hybrid cooling loop technology for space thermal control. The proposed technology combines the high heat flux performance of active cooling loops with the effective fluid management of passive cooling devices. The result is a simple, robust and high performance cooling technology that allows maximum degree of packaging flexibility. Phase I has demonstrated the technology in cooling high heat fluxes in excess of 350W/cm2 from large areas in excess of 4cm2 with low thermal resistances (0.008 to 0.065&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C/W/cm2). The prototype hybrid loop was tested at various orientations to verify its robust operation. The Phase I results indicated that the hybrid loop is capable of substantially outperforming the state of the art heat pipes, loop heat pipes and spray cooling systems. The principal Phase II objectives are to develop advanced performance features and qualify the hybrid loop technology for space thermal control through testing of multiple generations of prototypes and ground qualification testing of engineering units. The Phase II results will elevate the technology to a TRL 6: Prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. The follow-on Phase III will conduct flight qualification testing of the technology to address micro gravity operation issues. ",
