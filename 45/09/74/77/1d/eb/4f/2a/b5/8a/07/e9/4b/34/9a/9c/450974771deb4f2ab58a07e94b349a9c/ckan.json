    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "      Next generation air traffic management systems are expected use multiple software tools and quantitative methods for managing traffic flow in the National Airspace. NASA and other aerospace research centers are involved in developing advanced numerical algorithms for strategic traffic flow management. These algorithms can be invoked at fixed time intervals, or can be employed whenever adverse traffic flow conditions occur. In order to avoid spurious responses, the control algorithms should be used only when actual traffic flow problems are likely to arise, and not in response to normal flow variations. Queuing models describe the aggregate stochastic behavior of the national airspace, and can provide not only mean flow characteristics, but also the expected variations. This proposal advances the development of a queuing model-based methodology for triggering traffic flow management algorithms. The approach , based on the measured state of the national airspace system. The approach exploits recently-developed queuing models of the NAS, together with recent advances in estimation theory. \r\n\tPhase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of developing the traffic flow management triggering system using a simulation model of the national airspace system. Phase II research will integrate this methodology with NASA's traffic flow management algorithms, and assess the overall system performance n the ACES environment. Algorithms and software developed under the SBIR project will be delivered to NASA at the end of Phase II work. \r\n",
