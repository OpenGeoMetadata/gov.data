  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 10x10 meter cell size representing the backscatter (intensity) of several deep coral priority areas off the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in September 2009. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 9/3/09 to 9/7/09. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.x software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.",
