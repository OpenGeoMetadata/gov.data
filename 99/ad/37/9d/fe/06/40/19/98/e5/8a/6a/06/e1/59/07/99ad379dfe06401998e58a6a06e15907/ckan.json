    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to design, build, and test a major new instrument capable of both measuring and polishing the surface of aspheric mirrors up to 1.2 meters in diameter, and up to f-0.5 in speed, either concave or convex.  In the successful Phase I proposal, we laid out the instrument to the component level, and laid out and analyzed every critical subsystem.  We also investigated and experimented with the fluid jet polishing to be used by this instrument, setting the stage for further experiments and ultimate usage in Phase II.  The metrology accuracy goals, supported by previous measurements, are 1 nanometer rms for full aperture figure, and 0.1 nm rms for mid-frequency and micro-roughness.  The full-aperture and mid-frequency metrology approaches are based on previous successful SBIR projects, while the micro-roughness metrology is an improvement on standard Total Integrated Scatter measurements developed under Phase I.  All of the metrology instrumentation is integrated into a single measurement head.  At the end of the project, we will polish and measure an f-1.1, 560 mm parabola, and possibly an 890 mm, f-2.5 sphere.\r\n\r\n",
