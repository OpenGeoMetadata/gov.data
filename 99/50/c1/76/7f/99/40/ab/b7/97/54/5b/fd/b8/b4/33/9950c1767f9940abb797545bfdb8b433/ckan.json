    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Created in 2009 as part of NASA&amp;#39;s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate&amp;#39;s Integrated Systems Research Program, the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project explores and documents the feasibility, benefits and technical risk of vehicle concepts and enabling technologies to reduce aviation&amp;rsquo;s impact on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current-generation aircraft already benefit from the NASA investments in aeronautical research that have improved fuel efficiencies, lowered noise levels and reduced harmful emissions. Although substantial progress has been made, much more needs to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forecasts call for the nation&amp;#39;s air transportation system to expand significantly within the next two decades. Such an expansion could bring adverse environmental impacts. To neutralize or reduce these impacts is the goal of the ERA Project and its focused research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project is organized to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mature promising technology and advanced aircraft configurations that meet mid-term goals &amp;mdash; in the next five to 10 years &amp;mdash; for community noise, fuel burn and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions as described in the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/aero-rdplan-2010.pdf\"&gt;National Aeronautics Research and Development Plan&lt;/a&gt; and;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine the potential impact of these advanced aircraft designs and technologies if successfully implemented into the air transportation system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enable advanced aircraft configurations that might enter service by 2025, the ERA Project is working on technologies that will simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce aircraft drag by 8&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce aircraft weight by 10&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce engine specific fuel consumption by 15&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce oxides of nitrogen emissions of the engine by 75&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce aircraft noise by 1/8 compared with current standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ERA Project is comprised of three subprojects: Airframe Technology, Propulsion Technology and Vehicle Systems Integration. Work within the project is coordinated with system-level research performed by other programs within NASA&amp;#39;s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate as well as other federal government agencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NASA has also put mechanisms in place to engage academia and industry, including working groups and technical interchange meetings; Space Act Agreements for cooperative partnerships; and the NASA Research Announcement process that provides for full and open competition for the best and most promising research ideas. The ERA Project disseminates all of its research results to the widest practical extent.&lt;/p&gt;",
