The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Primary roads are generally divided, limited-access highways within the interstate highway system or under State management, and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges.  These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll highways.  The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1100 for primary roads.",
