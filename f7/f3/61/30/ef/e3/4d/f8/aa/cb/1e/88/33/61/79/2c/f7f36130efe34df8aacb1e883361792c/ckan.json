  "notes": "The Road Centerline data layer (TransRoad_RDS) contains all town and state highways, as well as many private roads. The centerlines were originally developed under contract by Greenhorne and O'Mara under the guidance of VCGI (1992). VCGI was the original steward of the road centerline data between 1992 and 2004. The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) then took over the update and maintenance of the road centerline data layer and is now considered the steward of it. The data layer has been revised to match \"Official\" highway mileage. NOTE: Prior to 2013, TransRoad_RDS met the requirements articulated in the VGIS Road Centerline Data Standard (http://vcgi.vermont.gov/resources/standards). In 2013, there was a significant change in its schema as part of the effort between VTrans and E911 to merge their two datasets. The data layer includes the field structure agreed to by both entities, but most of the fields that are E911's have not been populated in this release. This layer is the most reliable source for official VTrans road class (AOTCLASS) information. However, this layer may not include every private road, and the road name information may not match exactly the EmergencyE911_RDS data layer. The EmergencyE911_RDS road centerline layer, maintained by Vermont's E911 Board, has the most up-to-date road name and address range information and includes all private roads.",
