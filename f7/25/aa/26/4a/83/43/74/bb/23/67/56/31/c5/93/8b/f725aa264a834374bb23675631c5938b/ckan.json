    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop the next generation MicroShutter Array (MSA) as a multi-object field selector for missions anticipated in the next two decades. For many applications, this field selector improves instrument efficiency proportionally to the number of shutters opened simultaneously. We have successfully developed and built the JWST microshutter array system, which increases the observing efficiency of the Near Infrared Spectrometer by two orders of magnitude. As a result of this development, there is a significant scientific demand for these devices for space-based and ground based applications. The availability of large format microshutters can significantly increase the scientific reach of spectroscopic survey instrument such as WFIRST and future missions such as ATLAST. The basic design of the JWST MSA cannot be extended to such a large scales due to the design limitations set by the required magnetic actuation. We have recently demonstrated shutter operation using DC plus AC resonant pumping. The breakthrough demonstrates that we are able to eliminate bulky permanent magnets used for JWST MSA actuation, thus opening an avenue to create a very large focal plane field selector that can be built at much lower cost. in this program, we will fabricate electrostatically actuated microshutter arrays and demonstrate their performance for use as UV, visible, and infrared field selectors.\n",
