  "notes": "This line theme contains facilities and features for WMAs that are best represented as lines. WMAs are part of the Minnesota state recreation system created to protect wildlife habitat and provide wildlife-based recreation. Facilities and features are labeled based on a hierarchical classification system developed by the MN DNR, Section of Wildlife. Line features may represent any facility or feature that may need to show the length and direction of the feature. Several examples of features that may be represented as lines include roads and trails, fence, dike, ditch or stream, drainage tile, fire breaks, water control structures, gates, culverts, bridges, docks, and utility or rail road lines. Disclaimer: The only features in this theme are WMA user facilities such as parking lots, water accesses, trails and blinds. WMA management facilities such as water control structures, restricted roads, gates and habitat structures have been removed from this layer.",
