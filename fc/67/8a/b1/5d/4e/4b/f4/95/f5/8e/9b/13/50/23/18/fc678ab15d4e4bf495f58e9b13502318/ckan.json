  "notes": "Global Synoptic Climatology Network is a digital data set archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). This record combines the various types of data that make-up DSI-9290. DSI-9290a - Canada These files are a compilation of in situ hourly meteorological observations for Canada initially obtained within the framework of joint efforts to create The Global Synoptic Climatology Network among the Meteorological Service of Canada (Downsview, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia), Research Institute for Hydrometeorological Information, of the Russian State Committee for Hydrometeorology, Obninsk, Russian Federation, and NCDC. The data were then pre-processed according to a standard quality control routine and derived variables were generated (e.g., some humidity characteristics were derived from others). Currently, there are approximately 170 active stations, which can be operationally updated from the entire list of 768 locations, and another 350 stations are updatable with a delay. The maximum period of the data span is from January 1, 1953 to February 21, 2005. Variables in the data set include sea level and station pressure, surface air temperature, water vapor pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, several characteristics of cloudiness, and present weather. Each data file (extension .dat) is accompanied with a companion flags file (extension .flg). Thus, each data value is characterized by four flags: data measurement flag, quality control flag, confidence level/status flag, and data source flag. A lot of the original data are also available from the web site of Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC): http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climateData/canada_e.html. Archive contains three types of data files: 1. STN_ID.dat (768 files, 1 per station) 2. STN_ID.flg (768 files, 1 per station), and 3. Canadian_hly_stn.list.txt (1 file with essential station metadata such as station identifier, latitude, longitude, elevation, date of the first and the last records, and station name and province). More information on the digital data set is included with the data itself in a Microsoft Word document. DSI-9290c - Former USSR These files are a compilation of in situ hourly meteorological observations for the former USSR initially obtained within the framework of joint efforts to create Global Synoptic Climatology Network among the Meteorological Service of Canada (Downsview, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia), All- Russian Research Institute for Hydrometeorological Information-World Data Center of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, Obninsk, Russian Federation, and NOAA National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, North Carolina. The data in this archive have been compiled from several sources that include information delivered via the Global Telecommunication System, international exchange, and random data acquisitions. This information was verified versus the original data holdings at the national hydrometeorological archive of the Russian Federation and appended when it was necessary. These data were then pre- processed according to a standard quality control routine and generation of derived variables (e.g., some humidity characteristics were derived from others). Currently, there are mostly data for Russia but prior to 1991 the entire former USSR was covered by 2095 stations. The maximum period of the data span is from January 1, 1871 to January 1, 2001. Synoptic measurements were made three times a day prior to 1936 and four times a day at mean astronomic times during the 1936-1965 period. Since January 1, 1966, the measurements were made 3-hourly at Moscow Standard times (UTC+3) that can be easily converted into local standard times (LCT). There were only 75 stations with 8-hourly data prior to 1891. In the 1890s, 1900s, 1910s, and 1920s, archive was enriched with 8-hourly data from 28, 23, 32, and 30 stations respectively. Twenty six stations were added in the 1930s prior to 1936 and 463 stations were added in the 1936 alone. The increase in 1936 (and the following increase in the number of stations with available data in 1966) was not due to jump-wise increases in the network. Better archiving and digitizing of the available data were the causes. This means that some information can be (eventually) digitized and brought to light for research needs (\"rescued\"). The data set includes approximately 1,000 stations (mostly Russia) with 3-hourly data in the 1990s. Nine hundred ninety eight stations stopped reporting during the period from 1990 to 1993 with the peak years (415 and 364) in 1991 and 1992 respectively. In year 2000, the archive contains 3-hourly data of 757 stations. Variables in the data set include sea level and station pressure, surface air temperature, water vapor pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, several characteristics of cloudiness, and present weather. Each data file (extension.dat) is accompanied with a companion flags file (extension.flg). Thus, each data value is characterized by four flags: data measurement flag, quality control flag, confidence level/status flag, and data source flag. Archive contains three types of data files: 1. STN_ID.dat (2095 files, 1 per station) 2. STN_ID.flg (2095 files, 1 per station), and 3. ussr_hly_stn.list.txt (1 file with essential station metadata such as station identifier, latitude, longitude, elevation, date of the first and the last records, and station name).
