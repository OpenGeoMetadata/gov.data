    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan\n                        satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation\n                        and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully\n                        launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space\n                        Center in Japan.\n                        \n                        The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave\n                        radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor\n                        Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense\n                        Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation\n                        is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within\n                        clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in\n                        upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy\n                        rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above\n                        19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to\n                        discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of\n                        rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this\n                        method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the\n                        radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are\n                        10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz\n                        (vertical polarization only).\n                        \n                        The TMI Gridded Oceanic Rainfall Product, also known as TMI Emission,\n                        consists of 5 degree by 5 degree monthly oceanic rainfall maps using\n                        TMI Level 1 data as input. Statistics of the monthly rainfall,\n                        including number of samples, standard deviation, goodness-of-fit (of\n                        the brightness temperature histogram to the lognormal rainfall\n                        distribution function) and rainfall probability are also included in\n                        the output for each grid box. Spatial coverage is between 40 degrees\n                        North and 40 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the\n                        TRMM satellite.\n                        \n                        TMI brightness temperature histograms at 1 degree intervals are\n                        generated based on the 19, 21 and 19-21 GHz combination channels\n                        obtained from the Level 1B (calibrated brightness temperature) TMI\n                        product. Monthly rainfall indices over the ocean are derived by\n                        statistically matching monthly histograms of brightness temperatures\n                        with model calculated rainfall Probability Distribution Functions\n                        (PDF) using the 19-21 GHz combination data. Retrieved monthly rainfall\n                        data must pass a quality test based on the quality of the PDF fit.\n                        \n                        The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which\n                        includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the TMI\n                        measurements. A file contains 12 arrays of rainfall data and\n                        supporting information each of dimension 72 x 16, with a file size of\n                        about 40 KB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS &quot;grid&quot; structure is used to\n                        accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There is 1 file\n                        of TMI 3A11 data produced per month.",
