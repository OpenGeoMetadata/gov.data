  "notes": "These data consists of over 10,000 polygon delineations in one seamless dataset of drainage area delineations called Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Catchments. The DNR Catchment dataset extends into adjacent states where water flows into Minnesota and or where DNR Catchment delineations extend across the state boundary. Minnesota DNR Catchments are the smallest delineated and digitized drainage area mapped by the Minnesota DNR Watershed Delineation Project. The overall goal of this mapping effort is to produce the best drainage area delineations available that reflect the current hydrology of the landscape as interpreted from as many data sources necessary to derive acceptable watershed delineations. Minnesota DNR Catchments are delineated from the perspective of hydrologists who refrained from allowing cartography to drive the delineation linework. This was accomplished by excluding political boundaries and cartographic esthetics during the delineation procedure, focusing instead, on landscape hydrology. Minnesota DNR Catchments contain all of the land area(s), including noncontributing inclusions, and all water features upstream from, or between DNR Pour Points. Therefore, Minnesota DNR Catchments are not scale dependent. There is no size limit as to how large or small the delineation may be, an individual DNR Catchment in the dataset may represent the drainage area of a 1-acre prairie wetland or a 100-acre recreational lake. For a more detailed background on this data, follow this link to the DNR Watershed Project: History, Methodology, Terminology, Attributes 2009(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us:8080/gis/ancillary/DNR_Watershed_Project_History_Methodology_Terminology_Attributes_2009.pdf) document (PDF).
