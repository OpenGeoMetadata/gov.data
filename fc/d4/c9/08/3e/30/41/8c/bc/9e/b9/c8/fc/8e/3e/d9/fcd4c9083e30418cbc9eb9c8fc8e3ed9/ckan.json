    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set includes solar surface irradiance from Kipp and Zonen CM-21 pyranometers, both total unfiltered and filtered (RG695), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from Skye-Probetech SKE-510 PAR sensors. Measurements were made at six sites acrosss the Brazilian Amazon during the period from 1999 to 2004. These sites were co-located with AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) program sites. There are 17 comma-delimited data files (.csv) with this data set. The AERONET program is an inclusive federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by AERONET and  the PHOtometrie pour le Traitement Operationnel de Normalisation Satellitaire (PHOTONS) and greatly expanded by AEROCAN (the Canadian sunphotometer network) and other agency, institute and university partners. The goal is to assess aerosol optical properties and validate satellite retrievals of those properties. The network imposes standardization of instruments, calibration, and processing. ",
