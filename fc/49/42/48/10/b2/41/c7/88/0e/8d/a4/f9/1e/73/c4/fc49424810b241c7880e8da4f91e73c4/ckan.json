  "notes": "This line layer represents cross sections (XS) created from FEMA Flood Rate Insurance Maps (FIRM). These lines represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. These locations are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazard. Of 92 counties in Indiana, 86 are included in this DFIRM data set and 61 counties have XS information. The following 6 counties are omitted  Allen, DeKalb, Johnson, Lake, Marion, Vanderburgh. These counties will be completed as work on the IDNR project progresses. This floodplain data may be used with an associated floodplain polygon shapefile and base flood elevation line shapefile. IDNR documentation states - This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database. It does not fully meet all DFIRM specifications as found in Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database. A fully compliant product is expected in 2005. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",
