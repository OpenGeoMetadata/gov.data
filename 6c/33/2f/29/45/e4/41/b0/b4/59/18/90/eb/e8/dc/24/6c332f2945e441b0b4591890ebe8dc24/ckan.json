    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of the High Specific Energy Battery project element is to develop high specific energy battery technologies that enable new capabilities for future human space exploration and scientific missions. Several mission concepts require the large amounts of energy storage of and on-demand supply of high of power.&amp;nbsp; Development of low-cost high-energy storage capabilities can fulfill the strategic goals for NASA, by developing radical, high-payoff technologies, and enabling missions otherwise cost and energy-prohibitive.&amp;nbsp; The availability of abundant battery power will expand the capabilities of every human mission, including future missions to asteroids, planets, moons, libration&amp;nbsp; points, and orbiting structures.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, abundant battery power provides benefits for all phases of spaceflight: vehicle operations, electric propulsion systems, and destination applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high specific energy battery technology included within this project element has been selected to fill technical gaps identified by NASA as critical for human exploration.&amp;nbsp; Batteries have been identified as being critically important for a variety of elements and missions being studied by NASA&amp;#39;s Human Spaceflight Architecture Team (HAT), and address needs described in the Office of the Chief Technologist&amp;rsquo;s Space Technology Roadmaps specifically: Space Power and Energy Storage Technologies (TA-03).&amp;nbsp; The technology development within this project element aims to provide the best combination of reliable and power for low mass, volume and /or cost, with safe operation within human systems a paramount objective. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the project element will be to develop space qualified batteries that exceed key performance parameters for exceeding specific energy goals of &amp;gt; 200 Wh/Kg and energy density goals of &amp;gt; 460 W/liter at the cell level.&amp;nbsp; Meeting and/or exceeding these key performance parameters will allow for extending current EVAs (Extra Vehicular Activities) missions by an hour (Typical EVA&amp;rsquo;s performed on ISS normally do not exceed 5 hours in duration.), while reducing EVA battery mass by 20&#37;.&amp;nbsp; At the conclusion of this project element critical battery sub-system technologies, currently at TRL 2/3 (i.e. battery cell level) will be demonstrated at TRL 4/5 by the end of FY14, while establishing novel components that when integrated into a battery assembly have the capability provide approximately 7-hours of continuous power for EVA&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
