  "notes": " The NIOSH Mobile Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Work Environment Laboratory is a 2005 Wheeled Coach Type III ambulance mounted on a Ford E-450 cut-away van chassis. The vehicle was specially outfitted to allow its use as a mobile laboratory for the evaluation of mobile occupant restraints, patient compartment ergonomics, and potential design changes intended to improve EMS worker safety during ambulance crashes. The laboratory conforms to the General Services KKK-1822E Specifications for the Star-of-Life Ambulance. The vehicle has been outfitted with a video monitoring system to record human subjects in the patient compartment as they perform various EMS tasks. A Road Safety RS 3000 vehicle monitoring system is installed to record vehicle operating parameters during subject testing while the vehicle is operated over closed driving courses. The patient compartment is also outfitted with additional mounting locations for various occupant restraint systems that allow EMS workers to access patients and equipment while still providing crash protection. A PDA Stat EMS training manikin is part of the vehicle equipment.  ",
