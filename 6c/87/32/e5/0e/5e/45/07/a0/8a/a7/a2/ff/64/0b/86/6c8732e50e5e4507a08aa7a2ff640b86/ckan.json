The documentation in the Entity and Attribute Overview section of the metadata, and the README referred to in that section, are integral parts of the Regulatory Freshwater Wetlands data. Failure to use the documentation in conjunction with the digital data constitutes a misuse of the data. 2. The digital freshwater wetlands data provided are not a legal substitute for the official Regulatory Freshwater Wetlands maps maintained by the Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law Section 24-0301. Should a discrepancy exist between the digital data and the official maps, the official maps are the correct source of information. 3. The official regulatory freshwater wetlands maps may be amended from time to time; digital data obtained at an earlier date may therefore become obsolete. Digital data also may be altered independently of official map amendments in order to make improvements. These digital data cannot be relied on as a definitive statement of the location of freshwater wetlands. Wetland boundaries are subject to delineation by Department of Environmental Conservation regional personnel. 4. The borders of wetlands shown on both the official maps and the digital data are approximate at a scale of 1 to 24,000. Traditional cartographic or digital comparison of the wetland maps to mapped information that is collected and digitized at a larger scale than 1 to 24,000 is not cartographically acceptable and is subject to error. 5. It is inappropriate to make further distributions of the data, because digital wetlands data are not official regulatory maps and are subject to change. All requests for the digital wetlands data should be referred to the Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository <http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu> or to the Habitat Inventory Unit, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, 5th Floor, Albany, New York 12233-4754, telephone (518)402-8961.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
