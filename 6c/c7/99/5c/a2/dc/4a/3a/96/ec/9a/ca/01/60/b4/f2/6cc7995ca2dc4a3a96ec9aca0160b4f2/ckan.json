  "notes": " \n        The Ghana Community Services Activity was designed to complement the Agriculture Project by providing educational, water and sanitation and rural electrification infrastructure in the Intervention Zones and by enhancing the capacity of local governments to deliver the related services. These \ninterventions were part of a larger effort by the Government of Ghana to expand the provision of basic community services throughout Ghana, and were specifically expected to enhance the sustainability of the Agriculture Project by providing the necessary infrastructure to improve health of communities, to enhance skill development through access to education, and to facilitate small-scale post-harvest processing of agricultural products. \n\nThe water and sanitation component of the Community Services Activity was designed to provide improved water systems to 137 selected communities in the Afram Basin Zone, Southern Horticultural Belt, and the Northern Agricultural Zone. Over the course of the compact, a total of 392 water points were constructed, including boreholes, small town water systems and pipe extensions.\n\nThe Millennium Development Authority (MiDA), MCC's partner in Ghana, contracted the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) to design a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the improved water supply services and to conduct the baseline survey.  Following closure of the Ghana Compact, MCC hired the University of Notre Dame Initiative for Global Development (NDIGD) to complete the endline survey and evaluation using the same methodology developed by NORC to estimate the impact of the water improvement project. The evaluation was designed to answer the following six hypotheses:\n\n1. The incidence of diarrhea will decline, particularly in children 5 years old and younger.\n2. Time devoted to acquiring water will fall significantly.\n3. The price paid for drinking water will decline significantly, where water has been previously purchased.\n4. Households will consume a greater quantity of water for domestic purposes.\n5. Household consumption expenditures will increase.\n\nThis evaluation employs a pretest-posttest with pair matched comparison groups.  In order to assess the impacts of the water points, the research design uses a difference-in-difference estimate of the program impacts.  These estimates account for changes over time (before and after the intervention) in the treatment and control groups and for differences in those changes between the treatment and control groups.  The measure of the program impact is thus a double-difference estimate.  In this study, difference-in-difference estimates of the program impacts will be obtained for each of the main outcomes of interest as defined in the evaluation design (i.e., incidence of diarrhea amongst children 5 years and younger, time savings in acquiring water, water expenditures, water consumption, and changes in household assets as a proxy for consumption).\n      ",
