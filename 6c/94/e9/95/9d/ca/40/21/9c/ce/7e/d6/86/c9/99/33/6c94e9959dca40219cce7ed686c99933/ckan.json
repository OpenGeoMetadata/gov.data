    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The International X-Ray observatory (IXO) is due to be launched in 2021. The core of the instrument is a very large (3.2 meter diameter) Wolter I optic, to be assembled from approximately 13,000 individual elements.  Each element will, in turn, be created by 'slumping' glass over a precision mandrel, of which there must be in excess of 700.  In\r\naddition to the very large size of the mandrels (up to 1.6 meter radius), figure and size tolerances are exceedingly tight, ranging from 2 nanometers (axial figure) to 200 nanometers (radius variation).  The combination of size, accuracies, production rate requirements and the number of individual component designs defy standard optical metrology techniques.\r\nWhile polishing equipment that can meet these tolerances exists, the polishers must be controlled by continuous or near continuous (process intermittent) feedback.  In this effort we propose to develop a unique \"point-defined\" metrology instrument that can be incorporated into the polishing machine itself, to control the manufacturing process to the required levels of accuracy.  In Phase 1 we will develop conceptual designs for both stand-alone and on-machine instrumentation.  In Phase 2 we will develop a stand-alone metrology instrument, and in Phase 3 we will fully incorporate the technology onto a commercial polishing instrument.\r\n",
