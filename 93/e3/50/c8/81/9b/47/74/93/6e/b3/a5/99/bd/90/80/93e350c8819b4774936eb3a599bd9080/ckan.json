    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to demonstrate a fully automatic capability for generating a global, high resolution (30 m) land classification map, with continuous updates from satellite imagery and crowdsourced ground truth, and an annual publication cycle. The resulting map will be fully extensible, supporting many layers including Anderson type land cover categories, specific crop types in agricultural areas, and even continuous variables such as crop yield estimates. Our methodology involves fusing imagery with existing raster and vector ground truth data sets, applying a novel classification technique to enable vastly improved spatial/temporal model portability, and continuous updating as additional imagery and crowdsourced ground truth data becomes available. By employing a systematic crowdsourcing strategy that is responsive to local and regional market incentives, the map's accuracy will improve most over time in those geographic regions where higher accuracy is most needed. The resulting map product will find immediate use for a multitude of applications in agriculture, commodities trading, ecological forecasting, wildlife conservation and climate change studies. We foresee monetizing the continuous production effort by obtaining stakeholder funding to make a standard product freely available to the global public, but we also intend to develop higher precision, commercial products for lucrative applications such as precision agriculture in targeted locations worldwide.",
