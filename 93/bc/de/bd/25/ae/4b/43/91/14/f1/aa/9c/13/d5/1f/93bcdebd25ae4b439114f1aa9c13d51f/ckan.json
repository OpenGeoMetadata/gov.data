    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The incorporation of viscous analysis in design is vital for a complete\r\nunderstanding of aerodynamic problems.\r\n\r\nThis proposal offers to develop and integrate with RotCFD a method for semi-automatically generating grids suitable for viscous\r\nanalysis on complex configurations as well as parallelize the solver in RotCFD to take advantage of today's\r\nmulti-core machines.\r\n\r\nThe principle idea behind the semi-automation of the grid generation is to divide the geometry surface into patches and\r\ngenerate body-conforming grids from these patches.\r\n\r\nThis partitioning allows for automatic generation of grids with\r\naspect ratios suitable for viscous flows.\r\n\r\nConvection dominates the outer region, so unstructured Cartesian meshes\r\ncan be generated quickly and easily here.\r\n\r\nThe outer grid will be conformed to the inner grid so the entire grid\r\ncan be treated as one unstructured grid with an unstructured\r\nsolver, or as a hybrid grid with multiple zones and solvers.\r\n\r\nIn the hybrid approach, viscous solvers can be used for the inner zone\r\nwhile the faster inviscid solvers can be used in the far-field.\r\n\r\nIn Phase I a proof-of-concept grid generator, and a conceptual methodology for solver\r\nparallelization will be developed and demonstrated to work with RotCFD the\r\nrotor aerodynamic design tool.\r\n\r\nIn Phase II, the features of the grid generator and solver will\r\nbe fully developed and expanded.",
