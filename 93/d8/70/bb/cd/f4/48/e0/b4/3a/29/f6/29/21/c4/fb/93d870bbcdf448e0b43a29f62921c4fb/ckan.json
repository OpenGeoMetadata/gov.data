    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters have gained\nconsiderable attention for spacecrafts disturbance compensation because\nof excellent characteristics.  The application of current FEEP has been\nslow in developing mainly caused by high specific power, which limit the\nmilli-Newton thruster development due to insufficient onboard power.\nDramatic field improvement from nanometer carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a\nbig advantage to increase the FEEP thrust more than 10 times under\nconstant specific impulse (power).  Phase I study showed a lower power\nconsumption of 0.027 W/?YN from the CNT based ion source, comparing with\nthe power consumption of 0.063 W/?YN from the traditional thruster.  The\nCNT based FEEP ion source will be developed innovative in several\naspects: integration of CNTs into the ion emission anode, buildup of the\nedge anode structure by the combination of the metal tip emitter and the\nslit emitter, and construction of a edge anode array capable of\nselective operation of different thrust unit. The power consumption of\nfor ion thrust is expected to be reduced by a factor of 5 and more. The\napplication of the room temperature carbon nanotube field emission\nelectron neutralizer will further reduce the total power input to the\nion engine.",
