    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of the regenerative fuel cell project element is to develop power and energy storage technologies that enable new capabilities for future human space exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; Abundant power expands the capabilities of every human mission, including missions to asteroids, planets, moons, libration points, and orbiting structures.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, abundant power provides benefits for all phases of flight: vehicle operations, electric propulsion systems, and destination applications.&amp;nbsp; Development of high powered energy storage capabilities, such as regenerative fuel cells, can fulfill the strategic goals for NASA, by developing radical, high payoff technologies and enabling missions otherwise energy-prohibitive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to harness abundant power will expand the capabilities of every human mission, including future missions to asteroids, planets, moons, libration points, and orbiting structures.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, abundant power provides benefits for all phases of spaceflight: vehicle operations, electric propulsion systems, and destination applications.&amp;nbsp; Primary fuel cells and regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems provide&amp;nbsp; numerous benefits for planetary missions that require power while in extended/long&amp;nbsp; periods of eclipse (i.e. shadowed portions of planetary orbits), where batteries and photovoltaic/solar arrays have a limited operational range.&amp;nbsp; Regenerative fuel cells also have the potential to provide the necessary consumables (i.e. water, oxygen) for human missions and for planetary in-situ resource utilization. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of high powered regenerative fuel cells fills the technical gaps identified by the NASA Spaceflight Architecture Team (HAT) as critical for long duration human exploration, and addresses the needs described in the Office of the Chief Technologist&amp;#39;s Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap (TA-03).&amp;nbsp; Technology development within this project aims to provide the best combination of reliable power and energy storage, with safe operation within human systems a paramount objective.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The main focus of the Regenerative Fuel Cell project element will be to develop a highly reliable passive regenerative fuel cell capable of providing 10,000 hours of continuous operation&lt;strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;At the conclusion of this project element, critical fuel cell sub-system technologies will be demonstrated at TRL 5 and regenerative fuel cell system technologies will be demonstrated at TRL 3 by the end of FY14.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
