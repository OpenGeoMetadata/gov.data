  "notes": "Issue: Relative Potential Benefit to Sustainable Forest-Based Wood Products Markets The intent of this issue is to characterize where forest markets are and/or where communities are most impacted economically by changes in forest product production. Layers Developed 1) Mill travel distance: This layer was developed using known mill locations and the time needed to haul timber to them. The mills where divide into two categories based on their raw resource needs and production capabilities, then a cost distance analysis was performed using a travel time surface layer. The resulting layer was then stratified into 1, 2, 3, 4, and greater than 4 hour travel time categories. 2) Woody Biomass Facilities travel distance: This layer was developed using known and proposed biomass facilities and the time needed to deliver biofuels to them. The facilities where divided into two categories based on their operational times and raw resource needs, then a cost distance analysis was performed using a travel time surface layer. The resulting layer was then stratified into 1, 2, 3, 4, and greater than 4 hour travel time categories. 3) Forested Areas: The National Land Cover Dataset 2001, produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium, a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov). For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. Within this dataset are classifications of land cover, including forested areas. For this issue, the following classifications were used: Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, Mixed Forest, Shrub/Scrub, Woody Wetlands, Palustrine Forested Wetlands, Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetlands, and Estuarine Forested Wetlands. Issue Process: The composite layer shows a high timber priority close to mill and biomass facilities with diminishing priority as timber is further from mill or biomass facilities. The Mill distance layer and the biomass facilities layer were combined to create a composite layer. Large mills and large biomass facilities were the basis of a time travel classification. Small mills and biomass facilities were used for only 1 hour travel distance indicating their influence is limited and smaller than the large facilities. This layer was then reclassified 5 categories ranging from low to high priority. Calculations were limited to timber and shrub areas from the NLCD_2001_Landcover layer as described in 3 above.
