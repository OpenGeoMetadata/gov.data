    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Studies of potential space missions have highlighted the need for very small electric power supplies for a variety of applications.  The light weight radioisotope heat unit (RHU) offers a long-life, reliable energy source for such systems which is independent of the surrounding environmental conditions, but a device is needed to convert radioisotope heat into electrical power.  In Phase 1, Sest, Inc. investigated and fully defined a complete energy conversion system utilizing a very small Stirling-based convertor powered by a single RHU. It has conversion efficiencies greater than twice that of proposed thermoelectric convertors. Sest, Inc. proposes to complete the detailed design, fabricate, extensively test, and deliver to NASA a functional prototype of a Milliwatt Radioisotope Stirling Convertor (MRSC) system which will clearly demonstrate the performance characteristics of a low power Stirling-based conversion system. The reference MRSC system is designed to produce a net 100 mW or more of useful electrical power from a single RHU over an operating life of 10 years. The overall size of the prototype MRSC package is approximately 80 mm in diameter by 115 mm in length and has an estimated total mass of 250 g, for a specific power of 0.4 We/kg.",
