  "notes": "The Hart Mountain Refuge maintenance yard and borrow pits are currently heavily infested with numerous invasive weeds, the most problematic being Russian thistle (Salsola spp.), clasping pepperweed (Lepidium perfoliatum), tumblemustards (Sisymbrium spp.), and numerous Amaranth species (primarily pigweeds and other similar goosefoots); cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is also common/dominating in some areas of the borrow pits but is not yet dominating in the surrounding native habitats. These infestations are largely resulting from extensive ground work conducted in the refuge work yards in the last few years that opened new areas for infestation, coupled with mistimed mechanical control efforts that ended up spreading seeds rather than preventing their formation. Hart Mountain Refuge currently has very limited equipment to implement effective IPM prevention strategies; this equipment currently consists of an inoperative consumer-grade (home-owner) cold-water pressure washer and a standard-pressure garden hose with a spray nozzle. Better than nothing, but not by much. The work yard infestations, and the efforts needed to control them and prevent their spread, are distinct problems that have advanced beyond the Refuge’s current ability to control using base funds.Grant funds would be used to purchase the following as part of an integrated IPM strategy: 1) herbicides and adjuvants to get the work yard infestations under control; 2) native grass seed to establish vegetative buffer zones between the work yards and surrounding native habitats; 3) a hot-water pressure washer system for use on equipment and vehicles at the headquarters maintenance yard; and 4) a water tank trailer with draft pump, a (functional) professional-grade cold-water pressure washer system, and misc. parts and accessories, for use at project sites. Chemicals will include pre-emergent and generalist tank mix partners (e.g., Viewpoint®, Esplanade 200SC® and glyphosate) to re-establish and maintain bareground in the graveled vehicle use areas, and broadleaf herbicides (e.g., MCPA, 2,4-D amine, fluroxypyr, bromoxynil, dicamba) to be used in tank mixes to develop/augment and maintain native grass-based buffer zones between the work yards and the surrounding native shrub-steppe habitats. To minimize the risk of developed resistance, herbicides will be used in subsequent years (as necessary) following a BMP rotational strategy/tank mix partnership based on mode of action, chemical group/family and chemical structure. Native grass seed mixes will be applied in these buffer zones to develop a zone that can be easily maintained against invasive broadleaves using competitive, chemical and/or mechanical methods with minimal staff effort. The pressure washers and water tank trailer will be used to prevent spread of invasive species by vehicle/equipment from the work yards to native habitats, from project sites to other areas of the refuge, and between refuges/other areas (note: Sheldon Refuge already has a hot-water pressure washer system at their maintenance yard).",
