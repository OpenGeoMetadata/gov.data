  "notes": " The CERL PTC supports the Corps&amp;#39; painting activities by offering assistance through consultation, specification testing, training, research, and inspection or management aids.   The PTC has conducted research on surface preparation for wood, concrete, and metallic substrates and has studied various types of application equipment. The center has identified the necessary equipment and procedures to follow for a thorough inspection. Research projects aimed at improving 1) high solids coatings, 2) abrasion resistant coatings, 3) coatings for use on aluminum, 4) coatings which meet air pollution regulations, and 5) coatings for high temperature applications have been conducted.   The PTC has developed paints for civil works hydraulic structures both in this country and abroad. The center has also evaluated coatings for use on Navy torpedoes and developed a kit to rapidly test paints commonly used in facilities painting.   The center has conducted on-site inspections and evaluations of coatings for the Riyadh District, Egypt, Korea, Japan, the Panama Canal Commission, and COE Civil Works and Military Construction projects nationwide. The PTC also conducted investigations to provide evidence of criminal fraud in painting done on military installations.  ",
