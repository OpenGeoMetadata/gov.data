  "notes": "Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are together termed Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of the county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one urban core (urbanized area or urban cluster) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core.  Categories of CBSAs are:                             Metropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urbanized areas of 50,000 or more population; and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, based on  urban clusters of at least 10,000 population but less than 50,000 population\r\n     The CBSAs boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.\r\n            ",
