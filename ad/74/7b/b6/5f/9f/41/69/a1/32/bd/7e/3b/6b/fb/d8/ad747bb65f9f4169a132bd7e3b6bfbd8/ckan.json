    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the results of (1) synoptic streamwater sampling and analyses from numerous sites across Rondonia and (2) corresponding watershed characteristics derived from remote sensing and historical/available data sources. Sixty streams, in both forested and non-forested sites, were sampled once during the dry season in August of 1998 and 49 of the same streams were sampled again during the wet season in January-February of 1999. Analyses included sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), silica (Si), chloride (Cl), sulfate, pH, and acid neutralizing capacity. Watershed characteristics, including soil cation content, pH, watershed lithology, area, percent deforested, and urban watershed population density, were derived and calculated from digitized soil maps and available soil profile analyses, digitized topographic maps, land use mosaics from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, and Brazilian census data. The objective of the study was to determine the relative influence of watershed soil exchangeable cation content, rock type, deforestation, and urban population density on stream concentrations of base cations, dissolved silicon, chloride and sulfate in both the dry and wet seasons in a humid tropical region undergoing regional land use transformation. There are three comma-delimited data files with this data set.",
