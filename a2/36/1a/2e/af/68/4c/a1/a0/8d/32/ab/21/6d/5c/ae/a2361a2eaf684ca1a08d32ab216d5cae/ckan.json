    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase II proposal overcomes technology barriers for developing highly efficient all electric aircraft systems for the future, with limited impact to the environment. Turboelectric propulsion for aircraft applications is envisioned, and cryogenic and superconducting components are sought. In particular, low AC loss superconducting wires for the stator windings and superconducting wires with filaments less than 10 micrometers in diameter are of interest. There is an intense push in the aircraft industry to ultimately develop an all-electric aircraft, with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells being considered as the prime generation source for aircraft propulsion. The U.S. is in competition with Europe for the development the next generation all-electric aircraft.  Superconductivity especially magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors are considered an enabling technology that is being investigated by NASA, Air Force, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and EADS.  This means the need for a low cost, low AC loss (fine filament superconductor) that can operate in the 10-25K temperature range in 0-2 tesla fields for superconducting stators for motors and generators.  This wire is need by 2016-2017 time frame so all cryogenic motors and generators can fabricated and tested in the NASA test bed.  In the Phase I Hyper Tech has shown that fine filament MgB2 wires can be fabricated and there is potential for low AC losses in the 60-400 Hz range for stators.  In the Phase II Hyper Tech will continue to work on developing, manufacturing, and testing fine filament MgB2 wire.  The wires will also be twisted to reduce coupling losses.  The wires will be tested for their superconductor and engineering current density and AC losses.  The result of this work will be a low AC loss MgB2 superconductor wire for enabling all-electric aircraft development and allow the U.S. industry to lead the world in this needed and rapid developing technology.",
