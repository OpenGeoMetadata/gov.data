    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains modeled estimates of carbon flux, biomass, and annual burning emissions across the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso from 2000-2006. The model, DEforestation CArbon Flux (DECAF), was used to provide annual carbon fluxes from large deforestation events (>25 ha) based on post-deforestation land use, and the frequency and duration of active fires during the deforestation process. Carbon fluxes associated with the conversion of Cerrado to mechanized crop production, fires in Cerrado, and managed pasture cover types were also estimated. Model data outputs provided include:  * Estimated aboveground live biomass from DECAF in 2000 and 2004.* Annual biomass burning emissions estimates for 2001-2005 from low, middle, and high emissions scenarios with DECAF. There are 15 GeoTIFF files for annual emissions which represent the carbon emissions per pixel in grams of carbon per m2 (g C m-2). Model data inputs provided include: * Annual burn trajectories for 2001 - 2005, including deforestation, Cerrado land cover conversion, and fires in pasture and Cerrado ecosystems unrelated to agricultural expansion. These data were assembled from three sources: MODIS 500-m burned area maps, annual deforestation based on data from the INPE PRODES program, and the conversion of Cerrado savannah/woodland to cropland estimated from land cover information from MODIS phenology metrics.* Annual land cover data 2001-2004 for the portion of Mato Grosso covered by MODIS phenology metrics, tile h12v10, updated based on annual land cover changes in Amazon forest and Cerrado cover types.* Monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for MODIS tile h12v10 from 10/2000 - 09/2006, based on cloud and gap-filled 16-day NDVI data from MODIS Collection 4 16-day NDVI composites  MOD13 product (Huete et al., 2002).There are six compressed (*.gz) files with this data set.",
