    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Phase I SBIR proposal describes, &amp;quot;A New Approach to\nCommercialization of NASA's Human Research Program Technologies.&amp;quot;\nNASA has a powerful research program that is developing cutting-edge\ntechnologies for use in the space program, and these technologies can\nbecome important in many non-NASA commercial and medical markets. NASA\nis looking for new ways to increase the number of valuable biomedical\ndevices that are being commercialized. Virtual Incubation Company (VIC)\nis a technology venture development firm that creates successful new\nenterprises by focusing on developing early-stage technologies into\nmarket-focused products. We currently have 11 portfolio companies\nranging from new established companies (at TRL 2) that are seeking first\nfunding to established ventures (at TRL 9) with growing production and\nsales. Our business development team has proven expertise in executive\nmanagement, strategy development, financial management, funds\nacquisition, IP management, legal support, grant writing, market and\ntechnical research, and negotiating sublicense and partnering\nagreements.  This proposal outlines VIC's business development model,\ndemonstrates the breadth of its experience in creating actionable\nbusiness plans for various stage technologies, and provides examples of\nproduct development and company development successes.  Virtual\nIncubation Company has the experience and expertise necessary to help\ndrive improved commercialization of NASA's Human Research Program\nTechnologies by identifying and validating market opportunities,\noutlining go-to-market strategies, developing a funding strategy, and\nminimizing business development risks.",
