  "notes": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in cooperation with the States, biennially collects information regarding the generation, management, and final disposition of hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. Collection, validation and verification of the Biennial Report (BR) data is the responsibility of RCRA authorized states and EPA regions. EPA does not modify the data reported by the states or regions. Any questions regarding the information reported for a RCRA handler should be directed to the state agency or region responsible for the BR data collection.  BR data are collected every other year (odd-numbered years) and submitted in the following year.  The BR data are used to support regulatory activities and provide basic statistics and trend of hazardous waste generation and management. \n\t\t\t\t\nBR data is available to the public through 3 mechanisms. 1. The RCRAInfo website includes data collected from 2001 to present-day (https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/rcrainfoweb/action/main-menu/view).  Users of the RCRAInfo website can run queries and output reports for different data collection years at this site.  All BR data collected from 2001 to present-day is stored in RCRAInfo, and is accessible through this website.  2.  An FTP site allows users to access BR data files collected from 1999 - present day (ftp://ftp.epa.gov/rcrainfodata/). Zip files are available for download directly from this ftp site.  3. Historical data collected prior to 1999 may be ordered on CD. Please see contact information in this metadata file to order historical BR data.  BR data are typically published in December of the year following their collection.  Data must be received by authorized states and EPA regions if a state is not authorized to implement the BR program by March 1st of the year following collection, and are usually published in December of the year following collection. For example, data collected in 2001 would be received by states and EPA regions  by March 1, 2002 and states and EPA regions compile the BR data submitted by facilities and load the state data set into RCRAInfo, the system which EPA Headquarters (HQ) manage.  Then EPA HQ published the data files around December 2002. Additional information regarding the biennial report data is available here: ftp://ftp.epa.gov/rcrainfodata/rcra_flatfiles/rcrainfo_flat_file_documentation_v5.pdf and here: https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/biennial-hazardous-waste-report.  \n\t\t\t\t\nPlease note that the update frequency field for this data set indicates annual, but that the true update period is biennial (every other year).  There is no selection option for biennial for the update frequency field.\n",
