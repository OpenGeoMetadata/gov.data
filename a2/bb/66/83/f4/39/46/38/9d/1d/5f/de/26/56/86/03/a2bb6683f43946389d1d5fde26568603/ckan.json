    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "CLAIRE MONTELEONI*, GAVIN SCHMIDT**, AND SHAILESH SAROHA***\r\n\r\nClimate models are complex mathematical models designed by meteorologists, geophysicists,\r\nand climate scientists to simulate and predict climate. Given temperature predictions\r\nfrom the top 20 climate models worldwide, and over 100 years of historical temperature data, we\r\ntrack the changing sequence of which model currently predicts best. We use an algorithm due to\r\nMonteleoni and Jaakkola that models the sequence of observations using a hierarchical learner,\r\nbased on a set of generalized Hidden Markov Models (HMM), where the identity of the current\r\nbest climate model is the hidden variable. The transition probabilities between climate models\r\nare learned online, simultaneous to tracking the temperature predictions. On historical data, our\r\nonline learning algorithmâ€™s average prediction loss nearly matches that of the best performing\r\nclimate model in hindsight. Moreover its performance surpasses that of the average model prediction,\r\nwhich was the current state-of-the-art in climate science, the median prediction, and least\r\nsquares linear regression. We also experimented on climate model predictions through the year\r\n2098. Simulating labels with the predictions of any one climate model, we found significantly improved\r\nperformance using our online learning algorithm with respect to the other climate models,\r\nand techniques.",
