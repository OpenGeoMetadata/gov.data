    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The core planning algorithms to support the NGATS concepts will need\naccurate predictions of airport configuration over planning horizons of\nsix hours or more.  Such predictions are not currently feasible because\nthe configuration often is not completely determined by factors such as\nweather forecasts, future demand, and noise restrictions that might be\ninput to an automated predictor.  When this is the case, the air traffic\ncontrol tower personnel choose between the feasible configurations based\non factors such as staffing issues and individual controller\npreferences.  Furthermore, the primary meteorological forecasts\ncurrently available to the tower are not adequate to enable accurate\nrunway usage prediction.  In fact, they often fail to predict required\nchanges in flow direction, causing reactive rather than proactive\nairport configuration management.  In this SBIR, Metron Aviation and WSI\nCorporation will jointly develop an airport configuration planner\nincorporating optimized weather forecasts to assist tower controllers in\nplanning runway usage more accurately at longer time horizons than\ncurrently possible and to communicate the plan to appropriate National\nAirspace System (NAS) stakeholders and planning systems.  The\noptimization algorithms in this decision support tool will improve\nresource allocation not only at individual airports but also over all\nairports in a metropolitan area.",
