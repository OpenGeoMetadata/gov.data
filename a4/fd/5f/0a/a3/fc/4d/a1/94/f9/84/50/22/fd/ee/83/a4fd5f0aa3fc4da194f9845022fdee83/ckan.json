    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Model-based machinery diagnostic and prognostic techniques depend upon high-quality mathematical models of the plant.  Modeling uncertainties and errors decrease system sensitivity to faults and decrease the accuracy of failure prognoses.  However, the behavior of many physical systems changes slowly over time as the system ages.  These changes may be perfectly normal and not indicative of impending fail-ures; however, if a static a priori model is used, modeling errors may increase over time, which can ad-versely effect health monitoring system performance.  Clearly, one method to address this problem is to employ a model that adapts to system changes over time.  The risk in using data-driven models that learn online to support model-based diagnostics is that the models may ``adapt'' to a system failure, thus ren-dering it undetectable by the diagnostic algorithms.  An inherent trade-off exists between accurately track-ing normal variations in system dynamics and potentially obscuring slow-onset failures by adapting to failure precursors that would be evident using static models.  \r\nBarron Associates, Inc. and the University of Virginia propose an innovative solution that brings together Barron Associates' proven model-based diagnostic and prognostic algorithms with adaptive system identi-fication algorithms enhanced specifically for health monitoring applications that would benefit from online learning.\r\n",
