    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "USAGE OF DISSIMILARITY MEASURES AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING FOR LARGE SCALE SOLAR DATA ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nJuan M Banda, Rafal Anrgyk\r\n\r\nABSTRACT: This work describes the application of several dissimilarity measures combined with multidimensional scaling for large scale solar data analysis.  Using the first solar domain-specific benchmark data set that contains multiple types of phenomena, we investigated combination of different image parameters with different dissimilarity measure sin order to determine which combination will allow us to differentiate our solar data within each class and versus the rest of the classes. In this work we also address the issue of reducing dimensionality by applying multidimensional scaling to our dissimilarity matrices produced by the previously mentioned combination.  By applying multidimensional scaling we can investigate how many resulting components are needed in order to maintain a good representation of our data (in an artificial dimensional space) and how many can be discarded in order to economize our storage costs.  We present a comparative analysis between different classifiers in order to determine the amount of dimensionality reduction that can be achieved with said combination of image parameters, similarity measure and multidimensional scaling.",
