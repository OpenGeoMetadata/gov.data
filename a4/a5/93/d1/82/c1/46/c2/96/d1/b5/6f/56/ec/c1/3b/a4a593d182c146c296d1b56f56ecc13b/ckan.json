    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "With the increasing power demands and longer life spans of space\nvehicles, their thermal management becomes ever more critical.\nAccompanying this is an unprecedented need for reduction in spacecraft\nsize and weight.  However, reduced weight leads to higher power\ndensities, and waste-heat dissipation densities have grown by an order\nof magnitude with the use of smaller, more powerful electronics.  Active\nthermal control methods are needed to cope with the increasing heat\ndissipation requirements and environmental extremes.  In recent years,\nspacecraft have employed mechanically pumped fluid loops to efficiently\ntransfer large amounts of thermal energy between two points by means of\na forced liquid convention loop.  The development of long-life fluid\npumps, however, has not kept pace with the demands of advanced thermal\ncontrol systems.  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are\nheavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear.  Lynntech proposes to\nextend the operating temperature range of its long-life, low-power,\nminiature, electrochemically-driven pumps to -60&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;\nC to 110&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;\nC, which will allow their use in space and planetary environmental extremes.",
