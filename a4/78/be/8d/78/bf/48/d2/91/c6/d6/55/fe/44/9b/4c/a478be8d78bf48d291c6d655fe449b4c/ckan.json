  "notes": " he EPA Harvard Center for Ambient Particle Health Effects was established to address key scientific issues regarding the health effects of ambient particles. The specific aims of the Center reflected eight of the National Research Council&amp;#39;s ten highest research priorities for ambient particle research. To meet these objectives, the Center has focused on three research themes: exposure, susceptibility, and biological mechanisms/dosimetry. By building the Center around these three defined research themes, the Center has remain focused while maintaining an integrated and inter-disciplinary research approach, both of which was critical to our ability to address key particulate health effect issues in a timely manner. Each of our three research themes included projects that spanned several disciplines and that drew from the expertise and experience of our Center investigators.  ",
