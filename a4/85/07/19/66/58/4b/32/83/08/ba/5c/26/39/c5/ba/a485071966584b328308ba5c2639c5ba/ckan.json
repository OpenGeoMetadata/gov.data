    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Numerous spacecraft component databases have been developed to support NASA, DoD, and contractor design centers and design tools.  Despite the clear utility of component databases for improving and accelerating the spacecraft design process, they are observably uneconomic for individual organizations to build and maintain ?otherwise there would be several that were actively maintained and growing.  The problem is not the challenge of architecting the database or identifying the component types and data elements.  In fact, many organizations have succeeded in developing excellent solutions that have languished due to the cost of populating and maintaining them.  \r\nMicrocosm is focused on developing an economically viable solution to creating a sustainable component database.  The approach is four-fold: 1. Reduce the cost of gathering/maintaining data by leveraging web-based data with automated gathering and monitoring tools; 2. Drive sufficient value to component suppliers such that they are motivated to supply and maintain their own data; 3. Supply data to a broad range of users and organizations; and 4. Enable value-added contributions from users via venues like wikis, discussion rooms, links to relevant websites.  This solution will stand on its own as a viable business, and provide increasing value to customers (suppliers and users) over time.\r\n",
