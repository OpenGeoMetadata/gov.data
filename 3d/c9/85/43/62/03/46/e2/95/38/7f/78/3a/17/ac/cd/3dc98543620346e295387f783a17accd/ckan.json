  "notes": "This data set is derived from the Metropolitan Council's 2000 Digital Orthopohotos for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, but with modifications by the Land Management Information Center which include resampling to a 1-meter pixel size and compression of the data. The original Metropolitan Council data set contains 267 black and white digital orthophoto quarter-quadrangles (DOQs), 3.75' x 3.75', covering the 7 county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. The orthophotos are in UTM, Zone 15, NAD83 projection. Each image is approximately 115 Mb, with a .6 meter image pixel, and available in TIFF format. These orthophotos were produced using the USGS DOQ specifications except for the file format and the scan resolution (pixel size is .6m rather than 1 meter). The original imagery was collected at 20,000 ft. and centered on USGS quarter-quads. The resampled, compressed 1-meter DOQs for the year 2000 were created by LMIC for use with the EPPLViewer 2001 tool within the metropolitan area. The resampling and compression reduces the size of the data set from 78 CDs to 2 CDs.",
