  "notes": "Fish and sediments from the Missouri River and its major tributaries in North Dakota were collected in 1989 and 1991 and analyzed for organochlorines petroleum hydrocarbons, and elements. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PCB's were generally below detection limits in fish and sediments. Sediment samples were not contaminated with petroleum. Indicators of petroleum contamination gave conflicting results. However, these conflicts probably resulted from inapplicability of several indicators rather than from petroleum contamination. Laboratory confirmation of the applicability of these indicators to freshwater fish would aid interpretation of tissue concentrations of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Concentrations of elements in fish were compared to national averages and percentiles available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (NCBP). Concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and mercury were not elevated in the tributaries. However, arsenic and cadmium concentrations tended to be elevated in sediments. Zinc concentrations were not elevated except at sites where common carp were analyzed. Results of the NCBP indicate that carp tend to contain higher concentrations of zinc than most other freshwater fish species, so the elevated zinc levels in carp probably do not indicate environmental contamination. Mercury concentrations in fish were elevated at Garrison Dam on the Missouri River, a result consistent with results of NCBP samples from that site. These concentrations were below levels associated with toxicity. Concentrations of copper, lead, and selenium were elevated in fish from several tributaries, but were also below levels associated with toxicity. These elevated concentrations are probably not due to point sources of contamination because few point sources exist along the western tributaries of the Missouri River in North Dakota. Non-point source contamination from e energy development, agriculture, and erosion probably plays a larger role than point source contamination. Use of lead fishing gear may also contribute to elevated lead concentrations in fish from the tributaries. Energy development, agriculture, and other activities that may mobilize potentially toxic elements from soils in the watershed should be managed to minimize contamination of aquatic systems. This management need is greatest for selenium because the margin of safety between selenium concentrations in the fish samples and concentrations associated with toxicity was narrow.",
