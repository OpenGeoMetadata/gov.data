  "notes": "No effects of off-refuge placer mining within the refuge were found. However, this study was not designed to specifically examine the effects of placer mining on the refuge, but to provide baseline data in the event of mining near the refuge boundaries. Water quality characteristics of rivers sampled during this study are typical of uncontaminated rivers which are calcium- and magnesium-bicarbonate based. Except for iron and manganese, surface waters did not exceed state water quality standards and contained low concentrations of metals and other trace elements. Iron concentrations in water were elevated in all major and most minor drainages sampled during this study. Koyukuk River samples generally had the highest concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and zinc of the three major drainages addressed. Metals concentrations in sediment were generally indicative of uncontaminated sediments. The Koyukuk River generally had the highest concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc in sediment of the three major drainages addressed. The Wild River had the highest values of arsenic, barium, cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, thallium, vanadium, and zinc, and the second highest value of iron in sediment. Longnose sucker, least cisco, and slimy sculpin showed different patterns of metals accumulation. Least cisco accumulated aluminum, copper, iron, lead, manganese and nickel and, longnose sucker accumulated cadmium and copper. Slimy sculpin accumulated aluminum, barium, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, strontium, and zinc more than other species. Northern pike had the highest mercury concentrations. Concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and zinc were not elevated in fish tissue on the Kanuti Refuge. Copper concentrations in whole Arctic grayling, least cisco and slimy sculpin, and cadmium concentrations in 4 of 10 slimy sculpin from 1990 were as great as or greater than the NCBP 85th percentile for whole fish. Lead was detected in high concentrations in slimy sculpin composite samples. Concentrations of mercury in fish tissue were within the range reported for uncontaminated conditions. Sporadic high concentrations of nickel in fish tissue occurred within the refuge.",
