  "notes": "<p>The HRSA Data Warehouse (HDW) serves as the official enterprise repository for all data related to HRSA programs, grants and activities. The HDW provides both raw data sets as well as an array of visual and interactive tools for searching, accessing, viewing and displaying a broad range of HRSA programmatic information, related health resources, geographic data and demographic data. The HDW promotes information sharing and collaboration among HRSA staff, HRSA partners, grantees, care providers, health planners and policy makers and other audiences interested in HRSA's public health services and information. The current version of the HDW includes data from the following HRSA Bureaus and Offices: BCRS, BHPR, BPHC, HAB, MCHB, OA, OPAE, ORHP and OSHA, with additional Bureau and Office data added and updated on an ongoing basis. The HDW provides quick access to information that includes: - Find A Health Center - with search-by-address capabilities, maps and driving directions; - Identify HRSA Grants by Key Program Area or State; - Locate Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by address; - Identify HPSAs Eligible for Medicare Physician Bonus Payment; - Locate Medically Underserved Areas and Population (MUA/P) groups by address. In addition, the HDW provides the ability to explore data and maps that include: - Reports - traditional text-based reporting of the data is available in the HDW. Users can select, sort, export and view the data either by spreadsheet or preformatted reports; - Maps - visually explore the HRSA-specific information, health resources and demographic data in geographic relation to one another; - Map Data Services - utilize data from the HDW to create custom maps and incorporate your own data; and - Downloads - ability to download data on Health Professional Shortage Areas, Primary Care Service Areas, and National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The HDW data content and functionality are continually evolving so a What's New page is made available. The data is refreshed continually and most data are updated on a daily basis. Please see the Data Refresh Dates section of the website for more information. The HDW is designed to provide extensive tabular and spatial information available on HRSA-supported programs and related health resources. To do this, the warehouse combines data from various federal sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and various HRSA programs. For more information about where the data in the data warehouse comes from, see the Data Sources section of the website.</p>\n",
