  "notes": "National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) geospatial plan and the associated memo (Date: 20160304; FWS/ANRS/ITM/062385) from Cynthia Martinez (Chief, NWRS) to the NWRS Regional Chiefs  announcing the approval and release of the plan by the NWRS Leadership.\n\nThis five-year plan describes a framework to strengthen the geospatial capabilities of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) in the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). The charter of the NWRS Geospatial Advisory Committee (NWRS GAC) describes two primary avenues to do this: 1) developing GIS capability at field stations to support local decision making and 2) providing a national framework to enable efficient and effective application and sharing of geospatial information and tools across the entire organization. The refuges and regions continue to develop their local GIS capacities as needs and resources permit. The principle objective of this plan is the development of a national framework that can provide a coordinated and standardized system-wide geospatial capacity to address resource management and associated issues. \n\nThe GAC identified six priority data layers to enhance system-wide refuge management to focus efforts over the next five years: Assets, Water Resources, Management Units, Oil and Gas Locations, Monitoring Sites, and Vegetation. The NWRS GAC recommends implementing seven building blocks necessary to define, develop, manage, maintain and share each of these layers – Standardize IT System Architecture; Identify Data Owners and Establish Data Stewards; Articulate Data Products for Priority Layers; Define Data Standards and Requirements; Explore Additional Authority for Geospatial Accountability; Improve Workforce Geospatial Capacity through Personnel, Technical Support and Training; and Create, Maintain, Archive, and Publish NWRS Priority Data. Implementing this approach will allow the NWRS to leverage the full value of geospatial services in an enterprise system. Other data layers beyond the six that arise as priorities will follow the same strategies for development. \n\nThese recommendations are compiled with the acknowledgement of workforce constraints. While additional personnel would accelerate the process, we believe these recommendations can be achieved through adjustments to current staffing’s overall approach to developing and using geospatial data. Designating data stewards and adding authority to individual positions will enable workflows to become streamlined and remove redundant work. Improved data infrastructure will lead to less time spent on local data management and provide wider access to NWRS geospatial data both internally and externally.",
