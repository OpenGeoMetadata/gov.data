This shape file contains polygons representing the permitted boundaries of registered noncoal mineral production sites within the state of Iowa. Mines_2000 was developed from a database provided to the IDNR-GSB by the Mines & Minerals Bureau of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The data contained in Mines_2000 are data gathered, maintained and supplied to the IDNR-GSB by the Mines and Minerals Bureau of the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship (IDALS). The Mines and Minerals Bureau of IDALS gathers and maintainsThis information as part of their regulatory duties related to the enforcement of the Code of Iowa Chapter 208, Mines (Chapter 83A prior to 1993), and the Iowa Administrative Code, Soil Conservation Division[27] Chapter 60, Minerals Program. The IDNR-Geological Survey Bureau usually requests annual updates ofThis data from the IDALS Mines and Minerals Bureau. The data includes information on licensed mineral producers and registered mineral production sites in the state. The polygons were created from a program(s) written by John Schmidt which reads the legal description from the IDALS database and converts it to a series of polygons which are then combined into one polygon per mineral production site. The small number of mineral production sites which lay within so called \"irregular sections\" were manually digitized on screen in Arcview 2.1.",

The development of the coverages in the NRGIS Library represents a major investment of staff time and effort.
