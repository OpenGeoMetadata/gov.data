  "notes": "PCBs or other organochlorine compounds were not detected in water from any site sampled during this study. Detection limits reported by the analytical laboratory (0.1 ug/L) were less than the lowest PCB concentration reported by USGS (0.2 ug/L; 1990). One water sample container from Site 4 broke during shipment resulting in only 500 ml being analyzed. This caused the reported detection limit to double to 0.2 ug/L for this sample, which was still sufficient to detect the minimum concentration previously reported. PCBs or other organochlorine compounds were not detected in sediment from any site sampled during this study. Reported dry weight detection limits ranged from 0.068 to 0.147 mg/kg. All soil and sediment samples were subjected to particle size analysis, which determines the percentage composition of sands, silts, and clays. Grain size analysis for all soil and sediment samples is presented in Table A1. Total PCBs (0.37 mg/kg dry weight) were detected in the sample of red-rim melania snails collected from Site 2, near where USGS collected water samples in the earlier monitoring program. PCBs were not detected in any other samples collected at or downgradient of this site (Table 2). PCBs or other organochlorine compounds were not detected in any crayfish samples. Reported dry weight detection limits ranged from 0.222 to 0.303 mg/kg. PCBs or other organochlorines were not detected in pupfish (or mosquitofish; Site 4) from any site sampled. Reported dry weight detection limits ranged from 0.250 to 0.278 mg/kg. A sample of the bait used to capture pupfish and crayfish contained p,p '-DDE at 0.65 mg/kg on a dry weight basis; no other organochlorines were detected. DDE was not detected in any sample captured using the baited minnow traps even though the detection limits for all other samples were generally an order of magnitude less than the reported concentration in the bait sample. The placement of the bait in plastic bags in such a manner that the fish and crayfish could only smell it and not consume it may have resulted in the lack of DDE in any other sample. Also, we set traps for only enough time to collect a sample and removed organisms immediately, which prevented organisms from consuming the bait. Histologic examination revealed a few minor abnormalities in the six pupfish examined, but did not reveal any obvious health problems. Lipofuscin pigment, which is a breakdown pigment produced by oxidative cellular damage, was observed in the heart, liver, pancreatic and kidney tissue of all fish examined. It was unclear whether this is a sign of an environmental stressor or a normal aging characteristic. Other abnormalities, such as shrinkage of the kidneys and epithelial separation of secondary gill lamellae, could be attributed to problems with the fixation method used. These particular tissues may require a different fixation technique. One fish had pronounced vacuoles in the optic lobe (mesencephalon) of the brain. No indications of inflammation or parasites were observed in any of the fish (J. Scott Foott, FWS, written communication). All slides, tissue blocks, and remaining tissues were returned to the FWS Reno Field Office for educational purposes.",
