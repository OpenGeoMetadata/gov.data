    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. (ASC) has developed a number of 3D Flash LIDAR systems.  Flash LIDAR sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity for each pixel in real time.  ASC's Flash LIDAR has been used for autonomous berthing with the International Space Station and is currently under development for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid rendezvous mission.  Flash LIDAR is also being evaluated by JPL and NASA for Entry Decent and Landing for ALHAT and Mars. All of these applications use avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays in the camera focal plane array. APDs are complex epitaxially grown structures and biased at relatively high voltages (50-70V).  These arrays have a poor fill factor that is compensated by micro-lenses. These micro-lenses are restricted to F/#s greater than about 3.3 which in turn limits the effective receive aperture. If micro-lenses were unnecessary, an F/1 receive aperture could increase the collection area by a factor of 10 with no increase in noise.  This should result in an increased SNR of approximately 40&#37; but, because of the simplicity of PINs compared to APDs, an increase in reliability as well.  PINs are more radiation hard than APDs, are more operationally stable (therefore do not require individual fuses to protect against the development of high dark current pixels), inherently have lower dark current (lower noise), and are inherently more uniform. In addition low-voltage FPA drive electronics is easier to design than high voltage circuitry.  These improvements will result in a more reliable higher performance array.\r\n&amp;#8195;",
