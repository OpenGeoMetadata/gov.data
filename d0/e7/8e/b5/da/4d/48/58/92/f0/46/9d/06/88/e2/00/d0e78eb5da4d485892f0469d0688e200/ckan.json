  "notes": "The domain of the model is as follows: Row River from Dorena dam to the confluence with the Coast Fork; Coast Fork from Cottage Grove dam to the confluence with the Middle Fork; Silk Creek from River Mile 1.7 to the confluence with the Coast Fork. The basis for these features is the Willamette Flood Insurance Study â Phase One (2013). The hydraulics and hydrology for the FIS were reused in the production of these polygons; the reports and information associated with the FIS are applicable to this product. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) utilized for the Willamette FIS submittal was produced by combining multiple overlapping topographic surveys for the Middle Fork and Coast Fork of the Willamette River. This DEM was created from four sources: LiDAR of the Springfield area that was flown in 2008, LiDAR of Silk Creek that was flown in 2011, LiDAR of Fall Creek that was flown in 2012, and photogrammetry of the Middle Fork and Coast Fork of the Willamette River that was flown in 2004. In areas where no high-resolution elevation data were available, USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) data were used to supplement the DEM. The shapefiles Hi_Res_Extents.shp and Low_Res_Extents.shp define the limits of these areas. The horizontal datum of the DEM is NAD 1983 State Plane-Oregon South HARN with units of International Feet (NAD83). The vertical datum of the elevation model is NAVD 1988 with units of international feet (NAVD-88). In addition, some areas show surveyed bathymetry within the channel. These can be noted by the sharp increase in apparent depth, creating a stripe across the depth grid when compared to the LiDAR data, which represents the water surface elevation at the time of the aerial data collection. Bridge decks are generally removed from DEMs as standard practice. Therefore, these features may be shown as inundated when they are not. An effort to clip flood extents on bridge decks was made, but judgement should be used when estimating the usefulness of a bridge during flood flow. Comparing the bridge to the surrounding ground can be more informative in this respect than simply looking at the bridge itself. The features and depth grids stop as the Coast Fork approaches the Middle Fork on the northern end of the reach. See cfwgoshOR.shp for information regarding this file. This represents the depth grid for the 15,000 cfs profile.",

      "value": "[\"Use Constraints: The estimated inundated areas are based on flows at the Goshen gage (USGS 14157500), using the Willamette FIS Hydrology Report (phase one). The hydrology of a specific storm will likely be different than presented. This feature should never be separated from the feature classes Hi_Res_Extents and Low_Res_Extents, which delineate the areas of 1m LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and NED data. The area downstream of the confluence with the Middle Fork (forming the mainstem Willamette River) is shown in the Middle feature class. Flooding that is not due to the Coast Fork, Row or Silk Creek within the reaches shown above is not reflected in this feature class. Uncertainties and Limitations for Use of Flood-Inundation Maps: Although the flood-inundation maps represent the boundaries of inundated areas with a distinct line, some uncertainty is associated with these maps. The flood boundaries shown were estimated based on water stages and streamflows at the USGS streamflow-gaging station 14157500, Coastal Fork Willamette River Near Goshen, OR. Water-surface elevations along the stream reaches were estimated by steady-state hydraulic modeling, assuming unobstructed flow, and using streamflows and hydrologic conditions anticipated at the USGS streamgage. The hydraulic model reflects the land-cover characteristics and any bridge, dam, levee, or other hydraulic structures existing as of 2011. Unique meteorological factors (timing and distribution of precipitation) may cause actual streamflows along the modeled reach to vary from those assumed during a flood, which may lead to deviations in the water-surface elevations and inundation boundaries shown. Additional areas may be flooded due to unanticipated conditions such as: changes in the streambed elevation or roughness, backwater into major tributaries along a main stem river, or backwater from localized debris or ice jams. The accuracy of the floodwater extent portrayed on these maps will vary with the accuracy of the digital elevation model used to simulate the land surface. Additional uncertainties and limitations pertinent to this study may be described elsewhere in this report. If this series of flood-inundation maps will be used in conjunction with National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasts, the user should be aware of additional uncertainties that may be inherent or factored into NWS forecast procedures. The NWS uses forecast models to estimate the quantity and timing of water flowing through selected stream reaches in the United States. These forecast models (1) estimate the amount of runoff generated by precipitation and snowmelt, (2) simulate the movement of floodwater as it proceeds downstream, and (3) predict the flow and stage (water-surface elevation) for the stream at a given location (AHPS forecast point) throughout the forecast period (every 6 hours and 3 to 5 days out in many locations).
