    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The European Space Agency (ESA) Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow) snow water equivalent (SWE) v2.0 data record contains snow information derived for the Northern Hemisphere since 1979 to present day. The snow water equivalent describes the amount of liquid water in the snow pack that would be formed if the snow pack was completely melted. The data record is produced using a combination of passive microwave radiometer and ground-based weather station data. The SWE record is produced on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. SWE information is provided for terrestrial non-mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, excluding glaciers and ice sheets. The data are provided in HDF4 and NetCDF formats along with PNG browser images for quick viewing. A single file contains the data for a single day and contains two fields: the SWE estimate and an error estimate (standard deviation). \n\nThe GlobSnow SWE record, based on methodology by Pulliainen (Pulliainen 2006 and Takala et al. 2011), utilizes a data-assimilation based approach combining space-borne passive radiometer data (SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS) with data from ground-based synoptic weather stations. The satellite sensors utilized provide data at K- and Ka-bands (19 GHz and 37 GHz, respectively) at a spatial resolution of approximately 25 km. The SWE product is projected to Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) and provides the daily SWE estimates for whole Northern Hemisphere (lambert's equal-area azimuthal projection) in a single file. Although the EASE-Grid projection can represent data almost to the equator, the product is limited between latitudes 35° and 85° for physical reasons (extent of seasonal snow cover). The input satellite data for the SWE prototype products are from SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS sensors acquired from National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder Colorado, U.S.A. (NSIDC).\n\nThe snow water equivalent product is based on the combination of satellite-based microwave radiometer and ground-based weather station data.\n<ul>\n<li>The long term SWE data set spans from 1979 – to present day</li>\n<li>The SWE maps are produced as daily, weekly, and monthly composites</li>\n<li>Nimbus-7 SMMR, DMSP (F8/F11/F13) SSM/I, and DMSP F17 SSMIS are the main data sources: SMMR for 1979 - 1987; SSM/I for 1987 - 2009, SSMIS for 2010 - present</li>\n<li>Coverage: Non-mountainous of Northern Hemisphere, excluding glaciers and ice sheets</li>\n<li>The SWE maps are generated using EASE-Grid projection and a 25km spatial resolution</li>\n<ul>\n\nMore detailed descriptions are found within the project documentation accessible through the project Web pages.",
