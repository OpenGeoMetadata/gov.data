    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this activity is to develop a quantitative NDE\nsimulation tool for computed tomography suitable for desktop work using\nrealistic geometry descriptions of complex anisotropic geometry. The\nincreasing demands on NDE to address inspection reliability in the area\nof health monitoring and remaining life assessment demand that\nquantitative engineering tools be available so that cost effect\nengineering analysis on inspectibility limits and optimal inspection\nprotocols be done.  Most NDE techniques, as they move to a more digital\nformat, generate terabytes of data for a single scan.  X-ray methods\ngenerally have high computational needs.  Until recently extracting\ninformation from massive data sets was impossible due to limited\ncomputation capabilities.  By applying the emerging massively parallel\ngraphic processing cards (GPU) to a CT simulation, SimCT, we have a\nmeans to address the quantitative modeling in an important NDE method\nneeded to characterize materials in support of health monitoring\nactivities.  The computational techniques using GPU platforms and the\ndata analysis methods developed in the x-ray area apply to any NDE\nmethod.  This R&amp;amp;D effort will develop a GPU implementation of the\nkey subroutine in SimCT and demonstrate the capability to handle NDE\nsimulation needs using complex geometry in near real time.",
