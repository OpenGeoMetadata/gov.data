    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\tResearch on next-generation air traffic management systems is being conducted at several laboratories using custom software. In order to provide a more uniform research platform for en route air traffic management research, NASA has recently developed the FACET software package. While FACET incorporates most of the features required for conducting research, it is sometimes necessary to extend its capabilities. However, this can demand a significant programming investment.\r\n\tThe Phase I SBIR project developed the prototype version of scriptable software that allows simpler access to FACET functionality. This software is termed CARAT# (Configurable Airspace Research and Analysis Tool ? Scriptable). The first version of CARAT# is built upon a commercial software platform, while a second version employs a freely available, scriptable environment as its foundation. The use of CARAT# was illustrated by formulating four research problems during the Phase I research. By making the capabilities of FACET accessible to a larger population of researchers, CARAT# can help accelerate the pace of air traffic management research. \r\n\tThe complete version of the CARAT# software will be developed during the Phase II work. Additional research problems will also be formulated. The software will be commercialized to the ATM research community towards the end of Phase II research.\r\n",
