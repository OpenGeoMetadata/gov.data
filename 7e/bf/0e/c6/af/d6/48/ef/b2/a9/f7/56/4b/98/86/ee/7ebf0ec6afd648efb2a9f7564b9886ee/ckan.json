  "notes": "New England City and Town Area (NECTA) Divisions subdivide a NECTA containing a single core urban area that has a population of at least 2.5 million to form smaller groupings of cities and towns.NECTA Divisions are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of a main city or town that represents an employment center, plus adjacent cities and towns associated with the main city or town through commuting ties.  Each NECTA Division must contain a total population of 100,000 or more.  Because NECTA Divisions represent subdivisions of larger NECTAs, it is not appropriate to rank or compare NECTA Divisions with NECTAs.  Not all NECTAs with urban areas of this size will contain NECTA Divisions. The NECTA Divisions boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.\r\n",
