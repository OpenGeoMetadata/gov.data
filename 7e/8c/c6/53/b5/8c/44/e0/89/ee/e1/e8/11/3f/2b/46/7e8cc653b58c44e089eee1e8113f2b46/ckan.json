  "notes": "We studied the western Canada goose (B. c. moffitti) population at Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge in western Utah from March to July in 1996 and 1997 to determine the causes of low gosling production. Our initial interest was in whether water salinity was involved. We researched the effects of saline drinking water by conducting an experiment on captive wild-strain goslings that were collected as eggs from Cutler marsh in Cache County, Utah and by observing free-ranging broods in the brood-rearing impoundments. Mortality occurred in captive goslings at 18 uS/cm; effects on growth were evident at 12 uS/cm. We identified 12 hydrologically distinct areas within the 9 impoundments at the refuge. From 15 April to 15 July, conductivity measurements ranged from 3.1 to 25.4,uS/cm within these areas. Our results suggest that at the levels that goslings experienced during the critical hatchling period during 1996 & 1997, salinity was not a serious problem. During exceptionally dry years, if salinity levels rise during early spring, then its effects might be more directly related to gosling mortality. At the levels we measured during this study, mortality in free-ranging goslings was independent of specific conductivity. Rather, annual goose production appeared to be limited by predation and human disturbance. This conclusion is supported by 2 lines of evidence: a) low ground-nest success, and b) low gosling survival. Ground nests had lower nest success (56%-9 of 16 nests) in both years than artificial nesting platforms (90%-9 of 10 nests). Gosling survival to fledging was 25% and 52% in 1996 and 1997, respectively, well below survivorships levels reported in the literature. Our observations suggest that coyotes are abundant on the refuge and we observed them hunting for geese. Human disturbance appears to predispose goslings to mortality because goslings often became separated from their parents after disturbance. Low productivity also is related to the low number of breeding pairs on the refuge. During the summers 1996 and 1997, number of nesting pairs of geese averaged 26 and 39, respectively.",
