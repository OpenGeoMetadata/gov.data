  "notes": "This raster data set delineates the predicted probability of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the Eagle River watershed valley-fill aquifer, Eagle County, North-Central Colorado, 2006-2007. This data set was developed by a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological Survey, Eagle County, the Eagle River Water and Sanitation District, the Town of Eagle, the Town of Gypsum, and the Upper Eagle Regional Water Authority. This project was designed to evaluate potential land-development effects on groundwater and surface-water resources so that informed land-use and water management decisions can be made. This groundwater probability map and its associated probability maps was developed as follows: (1) A point data set of wells with groundwater quality and groundwater age data was overlaid with thematic layers of anthropogenic (related to human activities) and hydrogeologic data by using a geographic information system to assign each well values for depth to groundwater, distance to major streams and canals, distance to gypsum beds, precipitation, soils, and well depth. These data then were downloaded to a statistical software package for analysis by logistic regression. (2) Statistical models predicting the probability of elevated nitrate concentrations, the probability of unmixed young water (using chlorofluorocarbon-11 concentrations and tritium activities), and the probability of elevated volatile organic compound concentrations were developed using logistic regression techniques. (3) The statistical models were entered into a GIS and the probability map was constructed.",

This map does not show areas that are actually (currently) contaminated; rather, it shows the areas that have a high likelihood for being contaminated if nitrate was released to the environment in the terms of percent probability. Probability is a statistical measure of how likely an event will occur. Probability is not the same as certainty. A well in a high-probability area is not necessarily contaminated because contamination also can depend on the type of contaminant released, how much of that contaminant was released, and other factors not taken into account by the logistic regression models. Although the probability maps show predictions of detections as a percent probability, there is inherent uncertainty within these predictions that is not shown in the probability map. This probability map is intended to be a first approximation at developing a consistent rating method for the entire study area and may have several limitations for use at the site or field scale. The model and map does not account for local point sources of contaminants or features and processes that may promote focused recharge, preferential ground-water flow, or bypass mechanisms. Additional site-specific data are needed before site-specific decisions are made, such as the site-specific design of a wastewater-disposal system. The Eagle River watershed is rapidly being developed. As development activities continue, some variables such as surficial soils and irrigation networks may be altered through construction activities, which may have unpredictable effects on the ground-water probability ratings. This probability map should not be used at a scale any larger than 1:24,000, which is the scale of the SSURGO soils data. Probably the most appropriate scale to use this data set is 1:100,000, which would help take into account the combined inaccuracies of the input data sets used to develop this final data set.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
