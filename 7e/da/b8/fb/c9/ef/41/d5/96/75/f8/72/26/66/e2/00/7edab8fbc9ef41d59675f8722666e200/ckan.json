    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has undertaken a study to find environmentally friendly alternatives for the petroleum and solvent-based corrosion-preventive compounds (CPCs) used to protect flight hardware and ground support equipment. Film-forming CPCs leave either a soft or hard protective barrier that prevents moisture from directly contacting metallic surfaces, whereas thin and ultra-thin wicking CPCs displace moisture in cracks and crevices and leave a residue that repels further moisture. To protect an occluded region, the CPC must either form a barrier over the crevice mount or wick into the occluded region. In both film-forming and wicking CPCs, corrosion inhibitors are often suspended in a mixture of solvents and a base oil or grease. The base oil acts as a carrier fluid for the inhibitors and as a moisture barrier. The solvent, which is intended to evaporate after application, acts as a base oil and disperses the inhibitor. Although CPCs can be effective, the base oils are not environmentally benign and the solvents can be toxic and high in volatile organic compounds (VOCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidates tested for use at&amp;nbsp; KSC were soft-film CPCs, both common petroleum-based and newer environmentally friendly types. For this program, &amp;ldquo;environmentally friendly&amp;rdquo; refers to CPCs that are low in VOCs (less than 100&amp;nbsp;g/L), are not hazardous air pollutants, are nontoxic, and are non-carcinogenic. In Phase 1, the CPCs were applied to various steel and aluminum substrates, which were subjected to atmospheric exposure testing at KSC&amp;rsquo;s Beachside Atmospheric Corrosion Test Site, as well as to cyclic accelerated corrosion testing. Phase 2 consists of more rigorous testing of the down selected CPCs from Phase 1, new testing of hard-film CPCs, and a study of the failure mechanisms of the different CPC types. Phase 3 testing will determine end use application parameters, including material life cycles, application frequency, and compatibility testing with the specific end uses at the Kennedy Space Center so that they can be incorporated into current applications and future flight hardware and ground support uses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
