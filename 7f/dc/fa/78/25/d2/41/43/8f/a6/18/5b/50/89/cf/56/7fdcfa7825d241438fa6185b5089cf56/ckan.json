  "notes": " A\n               consolidated city is a unit of local government for which the functions of an\n               incorporated place and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged. This\n               action results in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD\n               continuing to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few or\n               no governmental functions and has few or no elected officials. Where this occurs, and\n               where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function\n               as separate governments, even though they have been included in the consolidated\n               government, the primary incorporated place is referred to as a consolidated city. The\n               Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated\n               city as place entities and creates a separate place (balance) record for the portion\n               of the consolidated city not within any other place. The Economic Census consolidated\n               city shapefile is similar to the current shapefile except that the boundaries are as\n               of January 1, 2012 in order to match the vintage of the 2012 Economic Census.\n            ",
