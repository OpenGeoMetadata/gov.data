    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the results of (1) field measurements of woody vegetation (shrubs) at 26 diverse sites across the North Slope of Alaska during 2010 and 2011, (2) field-based statistical estimates of site shrub structural characteristics, (3) high-resolution panchromatic satellite imagery-based estimates of the field site shrub characteristics using the Canopy Analysis with Panchromatic Imagery (CANAPI) model, and (4) adjusted CANAPI estimates of shrub characteristics at 1,013 selected sites widely distributed across the North Slope. A site characterization file is included with the assigned “Physiognomic vegetation class”, which was one of the criteria for the selection of the 1013 CANAPI sites, and with the sources of the high resolution imagery used to obtain CANAPI estimates. The CANAPI crown detection algorithm (Chopping, 2011) is also provided as a companion file.As part of a NASA-funded research project to map changes in tall shrub (taller than 0.5 m) abundance in Arctic tundra, a 3-week field campaign was carried out in 2010 and 2011 on the North Slope of Alaska to statistically survey shrub structural characteristics at 26 sites. The field data presented include genus, crown height, crown radius, and spatial coordinates of all shrubs sampled at each 250 x 250-m site. These measurements were correlated with raw CANAPI structural estimates and the derived regression coefficients were applied to adjust CANAPI estimates for the field sites and additional sites across the North Slope.",
