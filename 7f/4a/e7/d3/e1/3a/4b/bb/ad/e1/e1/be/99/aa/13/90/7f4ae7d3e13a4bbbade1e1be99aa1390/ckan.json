    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed innovation is a methodology for advanced process control and deposition analysis built around using signals generated by beam-component interactions in the Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3) system. These signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition.    Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process.    As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance.",
