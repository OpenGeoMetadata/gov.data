    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tOur approach is based on high-Q optical WGM resonators made with a nonlinear crystal. Such resonators have been demonstrated to dramatically enhance nonlinear optical processes involving optical, microwave and THz frequencies. Difference frequency polarization is generated from two optical beams via second order nonlinearity of lithium niobate (LN). Efficient difference frequency generation (DFG) requires three features. The optical beams should be near the surface due to large THz absorption coefficient of lithium niobate. The cross section of the optical beams must be smaller than THz wavelength to minimize far field phase mismatch of the THz beam. In addition, the optical beam intensities must be high for the conversion process to be efficient. The LN WGM resonators provide the highest figures of merit on all three requirements and are expected to outperform the Fabry-Perot resonator-based nonlinear optical THz generation. The required phase matching of the process is achieved with a structure represented either by the periodically poled domains or by a metal structure integrated with a resonator. The capability to produce micrometer-precision arbitrary domains in ferroelectric crystal chips is present at JPL. With collaboration at UCSB/ITST we fabricated metal structures on LN chip. These chips were then used at JPL to produce WGM resonators with an integrated metal phase matching structure. Intrinsic Q of these resonators was preserved at 10 million levels which is an important milestone. We then carried out an experiment aimed at simultaneous excitation of two whispering gallery modes inside the resonator. The outputs of two DFB lasers emitting at 1560 nm and 1548 nm (1.5 THz difference frequency) are combined and are coupled to the resonator with a prism coupler. Coupling efficiency exceeded 40 &#37;. We achieved two-wavelength pumping of the resonator and high optical Q.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
