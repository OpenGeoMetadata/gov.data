  "notes": "Data available online at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov Digital orthoimages combine the image characteristics of a digital image with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary dynamic digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DigitalGlobe DOQQ) is a 60 centimeter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast to the customer specified projection and datum defined in the Spatial Reference Information section of this metadata document. The geographic extent of the DG DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicing and ensure full coverage if the imagery is reprojected. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The digital orthoimage is formatted as a GeoTIFF image file with a separate FGDC compliant metadata file.",
