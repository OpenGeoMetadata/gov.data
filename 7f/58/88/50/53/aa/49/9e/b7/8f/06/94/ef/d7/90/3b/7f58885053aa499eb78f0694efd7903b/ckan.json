    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Metal patches were developed for the Juno Microwave radiometer instrument at P-band and L-band. The absence of dielectric in the metal patch design obviated issues with static discharge in the Jupiter orbital environment. However, metal patches readily scale to operation at other frequencies, and have excellent loss performance at W-band. Moreover, metal patches can be fabricated accurately using photo-lithographically defined microfabrication techniques that are dielectric free. The metal patch antenna elements that will be developed in this work are intended for use in an array-fed reflector system that is scanned in azimuth through the use of phase shifters in transmit and receive MMICs. This technology will support W-band cloud radar for the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystem (ACE) decadal survey mission, as well as other millimeter-wave applications. The focus of this work is to develop the antenna elements and associated feed networks; active electronics will be developed separately. The work will result in the design, fabrication, and testing of a 2x2 element array, termed a unit cell. A much larger feed array will be formed as the linear concatenation of these unit cells in subsequent development work. The unit cell (illustrated below) developed in this work incorporates all of the salient features that are critical to constructing larger scanning arrays, including the microfabricated feed network and the capability to predict scan performance. As a key part of the verification approach, a waveguide adapter fixture to measure network performance and element patterns of the unit cell device.&lt;/p&gt;",
