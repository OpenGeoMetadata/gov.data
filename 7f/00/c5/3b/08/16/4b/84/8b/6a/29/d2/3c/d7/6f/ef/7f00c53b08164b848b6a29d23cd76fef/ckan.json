  "notes": "This data set consists of digitized polygons of constant recharge values for the Elk City aquifer in western Oklahoma. The aquifer covers an area of approximately 193,000 acres and supplies ground water for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes in Beckham, Custer, Roger Mills, and Washita Counties along the divide between the Washita and Red River basins. The Elk City aquifer consists of the Elk City Sandstone and overlying terrace deposits, made up of clay, silt, sand and gravel, and dune sands in the eastern part and sand and gravel of the Ogallala Formation (or High Plains aquifer) in the western part of the aquifer. The Elk City aquifer is unconfined and composed of very friable sandstone, lightly cemented with clay, calcite, gypsum, or iron oxide. Most of the grains are fine-sized quartz but the grain size ranges from clay to cobble in the aquifer. The Doxey Shale underlies the Elk City aquifer and acts as a confining unit, restricting the downward movement of ground water. The recharge polygon boundaries were transfered from a figure in the ground-water model thesis for the Elk City aquifer to a photocopy of a paper map and digitized. The source map was published at a scale of 1:63,360. The Elk City aquifer was divided into three subareas based on soil type and topography and assigned the recharge rates 2.00, 3.92, and 4.00 inches per year in a ground-water model thesis. These subareas and recharge rates are used in this data set. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

Recharge polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site-specific. The recharge polygons were drawn onto and digitized from a plate size, 29 inches by 39 inches, paper map, with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.017 map inches (0.043 map centimeters) and 55.8 feet (17 meters) ground distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
