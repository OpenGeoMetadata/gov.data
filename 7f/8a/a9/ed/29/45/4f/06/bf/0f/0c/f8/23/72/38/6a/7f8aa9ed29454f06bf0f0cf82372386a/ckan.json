    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tIt is proposed that a very low cost wind tunnel could be developed at JSC to provide engineers with the ability to directly run small tests focused on improving existing capabilities without the cost and overhead of the traditional facilities. This capability, coupled with advanced data reduction technique development projects underway in EG3, could bring down the cost of future wind tunnel testing through improved testing, instrumentation, and data reduction techniques. Potential improvements to testing techniques aim to reduce the high-temperature constraints on testing facilities due to current data reduction techniques, increasing the number of facilities available for consideration and reducing cost and turnaround time for low-budget, rapid development projects across the agency. Furthermore, having engineers working directly with test hardware will improve product quality by bringing down barriers in understanding and communication often observed between computational engineers at JSC and experimentalists at our contracted test facilities and other NASA centers. A small Ludwieg tube wind tunnel will be designed. This type of tunnel is simple to operate and has low requirements for machinery and high-pressure equipment, making it safe and cheap. A review of &amp;#39;traditional&amp;#39; facilities will be conducted to define the tunnel operating conditions necessary to make it a relevant testbed for technique development. Once conditions are defined, the requirements of a necessary data acquisition system will be determined with the help of a bench test radiant lamp constructed to target heating levels expected from the Ludwieg tube. The extent to which the proposed tunnel will aid the development of test technique improvements will be studied. The intended product of this activity is a report detailing the specifications and cost of the proposed wind tunnel with discussion of the direct impact on several proposed test technique improvements.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
