  "notes": "This is a polygon dataset representing the extent of the LDNR regulatory area defined as the Louisiana Coastal Zone. This area comprises a band across the southern border of the state and ranges in width from approximately 30 miles at the west edge of the state to over 150 miles at the eastern and Mississippi River Delta areas of the state. A project to digitize the Coastal Zone boundary from the 7.5' quad maps was undertaken in June of 1997. This project was not only the creation of a digital line marking the boundary from digital maps, but also a thorough research project into where the line is actually located based upon records from legislative acts, the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program Final Environmental Impact Statement, and other information gathered from the files of the Coastal Management Division, the State Land Office and maps from the Office of Minerals Resources. This dataset is a product of that project. The data set Point of Contact has a file with copies of literature and references cited in this report.",
