  "notes": " FUNCTION: The calculation, analysis, and visualization of the spatially extended radar signatures of complex objects such as ships in a sea multipath environment and phased-array antennas. Radar signatures that are typically calculated include total radar cross section (RCS), high range resolution (HRR) profiles, and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images. The facility has been used on numerous Navy programs including the design and live fire test and evaluation of the DDG 51 and LPD 71 class ships. DESCRIPTION: The facility consists of several high-performance computers for calculating the radar signatures of complex objects such as ships and phased-array antennas. The radar signatures are calculated from computer-aided design (CAD) models that describe the geometry and material properties of objects. The facility includes models of the FFG 7, DD 963, DDG 51, CG 47, PC 9, LPD 17, and CVN 68 class ships. A large collection of CAD models of individual ship components such as antennas, weapons systems, and deck equipment is also available. The radar signatures of large objects are calculated using the Radar Target Signature (RTS) model. The RTS model is based on high-frequency scattering techniques and was developed by the Radar Division specifically for calculating the radar signature of ships in a sea multipath environment. The radar signature of smaller objects such as phased-array antennas can be accurately calculated using any of several low-frequency computational electromagnetic software packages available within the facility. INSTRUMENTATION: The facility consists of an SGI Origin 2400 parallel computer with 32 processors and 32 GB of physical memory, SGI Fuel and dual-processor Octane graphics workstations with 2 GB of physical memory each, several smaller UNIX workstations and INTEL x86 computers, and a General Dynamics TACLANE KG-175 for secure communications with a shared facility containing two SGI Origin 3800 parallel computers (one with 128 processors and 128 GB of physical memory, the other with 48 processors and 48 GB of physical memory).
