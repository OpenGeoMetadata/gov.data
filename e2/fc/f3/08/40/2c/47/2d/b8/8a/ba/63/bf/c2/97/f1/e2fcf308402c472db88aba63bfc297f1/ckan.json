    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture (IDAA) is a middleware architecture that facilitates the incorporation of heterogeneous sensing and control devices into a unifying system with standardized application interfaces.  The architecture is standards-based (IEEE wireless standards) and is an open architecture that can be easily extended.  This system is innovative from several perspectives: (1) the design explicitly supports multiple disparate devices ? to date, wireless middlewares have focused on single device types or single network types; (2) independent development is explicitly supported by means of a published application programmer interface (API) along with system client libraries that provide standard services; and (3) a Development Kit (\"DevKit\") that includes working examples and source code templates is provided to assist developers in the integration of a new monitoring device and/or the composition of a new application that is a consumer of the data produced by the system.  The proposed system will support the T3.01 Aerospace Communications topic by delivering a hybrid architecture that by design can incorporate multiple heterogeneous wireless devices and networks. Additionally, the IDAA system provides for multi-developer system extensibility, alleviating the problem of a monopolistic single-vendor implementation, where only the original developer of the middleware can efficiently extend the system functionality.",
