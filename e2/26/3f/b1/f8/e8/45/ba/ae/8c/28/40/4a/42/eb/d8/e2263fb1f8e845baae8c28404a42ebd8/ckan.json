    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a facility instrument aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors.  AIRS data will be generated continuously. Global coverage will be obtained twice daily (day and night) on a 1:30pm sun synchronous orbit from a 705-km altitude.\n                  \n                  The HSB level 1B data set contains HSB calibrated and geolocated brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. This data set is generated from HSB Level 1A digital numbers (DN), including 4 microwave channels in the 150 - 190 GHz region of the spectrum. A day's worth of data is divided into 240 scenes each of 6 minute duration. For the HSB measurements, an individual scene consists of 135 scanlines containing 90\n                  cross-track footprints; thus there is a total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 footprints per HSB scene, which coincide very closely with the AIRS infrared footprints.\n                  \n                  HSB is primarily a humidity sounder that provides information on snow/ice cover and precipitation using the 150 GHz window channel, and the coarse distribution of moisture in the troposphere using the 183 GHz channels. Combined with simultaneous measurements from the AIRS and AMSU-A instruments, the calibrated HSB brightness temperatures will be used to initialize the atmospheric moisture profile required for the retrieval of the final AIRS geophysical products. An HSB level 1B daily summary browse product is also available to provide users with a global quick look capability when searching for data of interest.  Summary Browse Products are high-level pictorial representations of AIRS Instrument (AIRS Infrared, AMSU-A and HSB) data designed as an aid to ordering data from the GSFC DISC or EDG.\n                  \n                  (The Shortname for this product is AIRHBRAD)\n                  Coverage: Global, Twice Daily (Daytime and Nighttime)\n                  Resolution: 13.5 km IFOV at nadir\n                  Spectral Range: 4 channels\n                  Channel 2 150.0 GHz\n                  Channel 3 183.31 \\x{00B1} 1.0 GHz\n                  Channel 4 183.31 \\x{00B1} 3.0 GHz\n                  Channel 5 183.31 \\x{00B1} 7.0 GHz\n                  Note: Channel 1 (89 GHz) has been deleted from HSB.",
