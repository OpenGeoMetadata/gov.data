  "notes": "For the past 18 months, the National Wildlife Refuge System has worked to create a vision that will guide the management of the Refuge System during the next decade and beyond. Conserving the Future is built on the foundation and inspiration of Fulfilling the Promise. This new vision seeks to not only further the System’s mission, but also to raise the Service’s profile in the broader national conservation effort. Consistent with our guiding legislation, Conserving the Future embraces bold, new ideas to realize the full conservation potential of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\nThe conservation landscape has changed, the playing field has changed and the stakes have changed. Human demands on the environment combined with environmental stressors are creating an urgent need for conservation choices. The scale of issues and challenges we face is unprecedented and impacts us all; no single entity has the resources necessary to address these challenges on its own. Conserving the Future acknowledges that strategic, collaborative, science-based landscape conservation – along with effective public outreach, education and environmental awareness – is the only path forward to conserve America’s wildlife and wild places. This document articulates the Refuge System’s role in this effort: leading when appropriate and supporting our partners when able.\n\n\nWe recognize all of our conservation partners, and explicitly acknowledge the unique and valued relationship, expertise, and authority of state wildlife agencies in managing fish, wildlife, and their habitats associated with the Refuge System. We also recognize that we must identify opportunities to engage new constituencies to help us meet our mission.\n\nConserving the Future was developed by Service employees in partnership with stakeholders through a transparent public process. Although focused on the Refuge System, this process catalyzed a national discussion on conservation that transcends the Refuge System. Several recurring themes emerged: relevance to a changing America, the impact of a changing climate, the need for conservation at the landscape scale, the necessity of partnership and collaboration, and the absolute importance of scientific excellence. These themes are woven throughout the document.",
