  "notes": "Sixty-six sediment samples, 105 samples of fish and 43 samples of bird tissue were cc during a 12 year period (1980-1991) from various locations on or near Sequoyah and Little National Wildlife Refuges in Oklahoma and analyzed for organochlorine compounds and selected elements. The purpose of this report is to summarize the data from these collections, evaluate status of these two refuges with respect to the contaminants analyzed, and suggest how this baseline information can be used to establish criteria for a long-term management program. Organochlorine (OC) compounds were detected at both Sequoyah and Little River, magnitude of contamination at the two locations differed greatly. At Little River, no OCs were detected in sediment. DDE, which was virtually the only OC found in Little River fish, occurred at low concentrations (0.02-0.88 mg/kg dry weight). Comparison of DDE concentrations from Little River with suggested guidelines for the protection of fish-eating predators, indicate risk to the latter. The ratio of DDE to total DDT homologs in fish was 1.0, thus, the source of contamination to the watershed was assumed to be old and well weathered. Conditions at River do not appear to warrant further action with respect to OCs. At Sequoyah, there was evidence for a greater severity of OC contamination. DDE found in 41% of the sediment samples. Fish contained several OC compounds; and some species (largemouth bass, white bass and channel catfish3 often exceeded the suggested predator protection guidelines of 4.0 mg/kg (dry weight) total DDT or 0.4 mg/kg total chlordane, heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin. The geometric mean ratio of DDE to total DDT was 0.84, suggesting a less weathered or more recent source of parent material. Since the use of OC products has been banned in the United States, the management objective at Sequoyah should be a steady reduction in concentrations and an increase in DDE/total DDT ratios in the aquatic food-chain. A monitoring program to verify the desired trend is outlined. No \"problem\" trace element contamination was evident at either Sequoyah or Little River, however some form of anthropogenic trace element enrichment is always possible at either location in the future. The management objective at each refuge should be to maintain present base concentrations, particularly with respect to those elements known to be potentially toxic (i.e. arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium and zinc). Therefore, a monitoring program for detection of element contamination is described and recommended for both refuges.",
