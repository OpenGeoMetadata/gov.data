    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA has a cross-project need for large format aspheric x-ray optics, which, demonstrate exceptionally low periodic surface errors. Available technologies to both measure and fabricate such surfaces are limited and have not been demonstrated to the precision required. The special requirements contemplated by future x-ray observatory missions include far off-axis hyperbolic and parabolic mirror segments used in nested Wolter Type-1 x-ray telescopes. Such mirrors are to be produced by replication on convex mandrels to meet aggressive manufacturing cost goals, however doing so will require breakthroughs in process, manufacturing and testing technologies.\r\n\r\nIn 2008-9, Aperture Optical Sciences Inc. designed and built a unique custom cylindrical grinding and polishing machine and delivered this machine to a customer for the automated production of cylinder optics. The machine embodied a fundamental technology that could be applied toward the low-cost production of x-ray optics mandrels including a fully scalable ? large tool computer controlled platform and an algorithmic approach to figure correction using programmable motion and pressure control.  Our proposed work would model the adaptation of this machine design and would model the technology and parametric machine controls required to produce full-aperture mirrors having low amplitude periods across the full power spectrum of interest.\r\n",
