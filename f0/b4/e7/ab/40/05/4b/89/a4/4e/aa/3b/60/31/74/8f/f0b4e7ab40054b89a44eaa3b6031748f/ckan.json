    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The suitport concept will enable three main improvements in EVA by providing reductions in: pre-EVA time from hours to less than thirty minutes; airlock consumables; and contamination returned to the cabin with the EVA crewmember. Suitports capitalize on the Atmospheres Working Group recommendation of an 8 psi and 32&#37; cabin environment for exploration spacecraft. The reduced cabin pressure allows the suitport and the suit to be exposed to full cabin pressure while maintaining a lightweight, EVA-friendly design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two different designs for a suitport were built and tested: the Marman and Pneumatic Flipper suitports.&amp;nbsp; Two generations of Marman suitports have been tested with mockup suits on rover cabins. &amp;nbsp;These tests have demonstrated the ability of test subjects to dock and undock from the suitport and have helped define the operational concepts and timelines, demonstrating the potential of suitport to save significant amounts of crew time before and after EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first generation Marman suitport has also been tested pressurized on a bench top engineering unit which has successfully demonstrated the pressurizable seal concept including the ability to seal after the introduction and removal of contamination (such as dust/soil) to the sealing surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second generation Marman suitport and the first generation Pneumatic Flipper suitport have also been tested with a spacesuit prototype using the pressure differentials of the spacecraft. The test was performed using the JSC B32 Chamber B, a human rated vacuum chamber. This test demonstrated the first ever pressurized donning and doffing of a rear entry space suit through a suitport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suitport operations rely on the Advanced EVA project to design the advanced suit in a suitport-compatible manner, which presents significant challenges. &amp;nbsp;The suit must add a SuitPort Interface Plate (SIP) and withstand harsher storage environments. Life support system interfaces must be plumbed to the front of the suit to insure operation when installed in the suitport. The components of the life support system must be packaged to support this plumbing configuration and to allow for hinging of the life support backpack for rear-entry donning and doffing of the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
