    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\tBalcones Technologies, LLC proposes to adapt technologies developed by and resident in The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (CEM) in the areas of superconducting Trapped Field Magnet (TFM) motors, magnetic bearings, terrestrial and space-based flywheel energy storage systems, and air-core generators to address STTR 2010-1 Subtopic T3.01, Technologies for Space Power and Propulsion.  In particular, our team will develop a concept design for high field intensity superconducting Trapped Field Magnetic Bearings (TFMB) for a space-based flywheel system, including magnetic field activation and cryogenic cooling subsystems.  The design will focus on exploiting approximately $47M of CEM technology to develop commercially viable superconducting magnetic bearings that significantly exceed the force density (developed force per unit of system mass) of today's magnetic bearings and will optimize the design for the space flywheel application rather than adapt terrestrial designs for space.\r\n\r\nRelevant features of our anticipated solution include:\r\n?\tMuch lower power usage than conventional non-superconducting magnetic bearings.\r\n?\tMuch stiffer magnetic bearings than conventional non-superconducting magnetic bearings.\r\n?\tMuch stiffer magnetic bearings than current superconducting magnetic bearing technology.\r\n?\tCapable of high rotational speeds.\r\n?\tOperation at magnetic fields of 2.5-3 Tesla to allow demonstration within a normal 24 month Phase II STTR, but with a design approach amenable to future systems at ~ 10 Tesla .\r\n?\tAir-core magnetic circuit design (e.g., does not employ iron to guide magnetic fields which limits magnetic fields to 2 Tesla or less and practically limits operational fluxes to ~ 1 Tesla).\r\n?\tTFM charging system to inject the magnetic field, most likely based on a system to cool the magnet while maintaining an applied charging field, but could also be a pulse charging system of a pre-cooled TFM.\r\n",
