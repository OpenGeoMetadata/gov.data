    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hot Corrosion of turbine engine components has been studied for many years.  The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II Hot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Modern turbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in part by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for nickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures approach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of Type II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by localized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing salts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the fatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at hot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools needed by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion effects are not currently available.\r\nThe overall objective of this research program will be to develop DARWIN-HC  a probabilistic Type II hot corrosion, fatigue cracking, and fatigue life prediction software tool for nickel-based superalloy turbine disks.    The Phase I research was based on data provided by both NASA and the research team. The key Phase I innovations included enhanced probabilistic models that are explicitly parameterized by the relevant environmental and material variables.  The models are a significant step towards modeling the spatial and temporal evolutions of corrosion pits  setting the stage for the development of fatigue life prediction capability.    Whereas the existing DARWIN software contains probabilistic models of hard alpha anomalies in titanium disk materials, DARWIN-HC will feature the probabilistic models of defect distributions due to Type II hot corrosion, which can lead to fatigue crack initiation.  In Phase II, the team will create a functional DARWIN-HC prototype software application for evaluation by NASA and industry.\r\n\r\n",
