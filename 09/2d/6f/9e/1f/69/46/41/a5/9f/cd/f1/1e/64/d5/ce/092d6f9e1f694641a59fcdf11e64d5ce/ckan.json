  "notes": "This dataset represents depth predictions from a bathymetric model developed for the New York offshore spatial planning area. The model also includes spatially-explicit uncertainty estimates represented in another raster dataset. The model used to derive depth estimates builds on previous predictive bathymetric modeling approaches in the region (e.g. Calder, 2006), provides a continuous gridded bathymetric surface, and allows users to view and explore spatial variation in the vertical accuracy of depth predictions. The spatial resolution of the model is identical to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Relief Model (CRM; horizontal resolution approximately 83.8 m) in the study area and was built from the same database of hydrographic survey points.",
