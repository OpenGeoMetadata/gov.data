    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hybrid-Electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) is becoming widely accepted and new tools will be required for future development.  This Phase I SBIR proposal creates a turbo-electric, hybrid electric propulsion system sizing and weight synthesis tool specifically designed for use in an MDAO framework.  It will offer significant flexibility regarding placement of the propulsive devices for top-level hybrid design, including over-wing, under-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and other configurations.  The user will supply power required, fan speed, fan torque, TOGW estimation, desired power split between engines and batteries, and selection for propulsion system locations.  Sizing and weight analysis for electric motors, generators, speed controllers, gearboxes, cables, transformers, batteries, and cooling systems will be considered including structural considerations for heavily modified aircraft components for each system.  The outputs will be hybrid electric propulsion system weight, sizes for the sub-system components, and revised HEDP specific TOGW calculation.  The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a tool within a framework for top-level and conceptual hybrid electric propulsion studies.  Additionally, the fidelity of the current NASA models is based on empirical-data and extrapolations.  This proposed tool will employ physic-based models with empirical corrections, when needed.  A Phase II and future commercialization plan have been identified.",
