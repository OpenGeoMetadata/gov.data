    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": " Abstract\r\n\r\nThe semiconductor industry is constantly searching for new ways to increase the rate of both process development and yield learning.  As more data is being collected and stored throughout the chip manufacturing process, it has become increasingly more difficult to analyze yield signals using traditional statistical methods.  Most of the serious yield issues manifest themselves as non-random electrical failure maps. Our semi-supervised fault\r\ndetection framework has elements of Spatial Signature Analysis (SSA) to capture yield signals for very large datasets without losing the critical details typically involved with summarization techniques.  It includes signature detection, de-noising, clustering, and purification that allow one to create a true spatial response metric of the yield issue. Once this has been accomplished, one can load process data to join with the spatial\r\nresponse and invoke customized rule induction algorithms that generate a set of hypotheses - likely process causes for a specific spatial target response.  The framework has been successfully used at Intel and represents an example of the growing influence of modern statistical learning in the semiconductor industry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Speaker:**\r\n\r\n**Dr. Eugene Tuv, Intel**\r\n\r\nDr. Eugene Tuv is a Senior Staff Research Scientist in the Logic Technology Department at Intel. His research interests include supervised and unsupervised non-parametric machine learning with massive heterogeneous data. Prior to Intel he worked as a research scientist in the Institute of Nuclear Research, Ukrainian Academy of Science. He holds postgraduate degrees in Mathematics and Applied Statistics.",
