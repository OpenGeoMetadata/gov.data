  "notes": " Evaluations were conducted to determine the detection characteristics and other operating parameters for two systems that are designed to protect workers on foot from being struck by construction equipment. The first system consisted of electronic tags worn by workers that transmit a pulsed radio frequency signal that is detected by tag readers mounted on mobile equipment. Time of flight signal measurements are used to determine distance to the tag. This system, developed by Tag Safety Systems, progressed to proof of concept, but was not far enough in development to progress to field trials. The second system tested was the TramGuard proximity warning system marketed by GeoSteering, Inc. for underground mining. This system uses tags on workers that detect a magnetic marker field generated by a loop antenna mounted on mobile equipment. Tests revealed modifications that were needed in order to use this system on construction equipment. Suggested modifications have been implemented on a new system called Hazardavert that will be tested at roadway and building construction sites.  ",
