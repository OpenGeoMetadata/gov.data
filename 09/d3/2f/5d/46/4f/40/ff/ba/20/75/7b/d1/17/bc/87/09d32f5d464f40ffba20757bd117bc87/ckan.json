  "notes": "Urvina Bay coral radiocarbon (14C) timeseries. (90 deg W, 0.5 deg S) Coral radiocarbon (Delta-14C) on untreated, low-speed drilled samples. Precision is +/- 4 per mil as documented by an in-house homogenized coral standard, and presented as AGE CORRECTED DELTA-14C [see Stuiver Polach, 1977]. The sample cores were made on a Porites lobata coral, in Urvina Bay, Isabella Island, Galapagos Archipelago by G. Wellington, and supplied by R. Dunbar. Cores were split and cleaned with distilled water. After identifying the major vertical growth axis, the coral was sequentially sampled at 2 mm increments with a low-speed drill. Splits (~1 mg) were reacted in vacuo in a modified autocarbonate device at 90 deg C and the purified CO2 analyzed on a gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The remaining sample splits (~7-8 mg) were placed in individual reaction chambers, evacuated, heated, and then acidified with orthophosphoric acid at 90 deg C. The evolved CO2 was purified, trapped, and converted to graphite in the presence of cobalt catalyst in individual reactors [Vogel et al., 1987]. Graphite targets were measured at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [Davis et al., 1990]. Radiocarbon results are reported as Delta-14C (\") as defined by Stuiver and Polach [1977] and include the d13C correction obtained from the stable isotope results. Analytical precision and accuracy of the radiocarbon measurements is +/- 4\" (1s) based on repeated analyses of an in-house homogenized near-modern coral and accepted secondary and tertiary radiocarbon standards. The coral died during the 1982/83 El Nino event. In keeping with the definition of \"high-precision radiocarbon\" ( less than 3 per mil, 1-sigma) data have been rounded to zero significant figures. The age model for these data was derived from a preliminary delta-13C age model which was then optimized by mapping the delta-18O data to a local instrumental SST record. A similar result was obtained using high-precision [Sr/Ca] analyses on aliquots of the same drilled powders used for d18O,d13C, and Delta-14C. Age model errors are estimated (brute force approach) at +/- 1 month.",
