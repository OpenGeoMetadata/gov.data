The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is\n          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n          \n          Combined New England City and Town Areas (CNECTA) are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of two or more adjacent New England\n          City and Town Areas (NECTA) that have significant employment interchanges.  The NECTAs that combine to create a CNECTA retain separate identities within the\n          larger combined statistical area.  Because CNECTAs represent groupings of NECTAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual NECTAs.  The CNECTA\n          boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.",
