  "notes": "The Lower Souris Migratory Waterfowl Refuge (now known as the J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge) is located just south of the Canadian border in North Dakota. The refuge was established and constructed by the CCC in 1935 to restore waterfowl habitat. This report gives an overview of events taking place on the refuge since June 1, 1936. Actual development work on the Lower Souris Refuge has been in progress for approximately a year. Over the course of the year, many miles of marshland were flooded, ducks have taken residence at the refuge, and many development projects have taken place. Much time was taken to improve habitat through nesting islands, nest boxes and fish shelters. Other projects focused on vegetation by means of seed collection and reforestation. A feed crop planting program was enacted and had been carried out as far as was practical.  In addition, erosion control became a large concern due to the droughts, over-grazing and winds. Windbreaks were constructed in areas of concern and/or trees were planted. The refuge headquarters took shape complete with an equipment shed and a goose pen. The report concludes with an update on refuge wildlife.",
