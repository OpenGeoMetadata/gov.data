    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Control surface free-play is important throughout the lifetime of a\nflight vehicle. Free-play can result in aeroservoelastic limit cycle\noscillations (LCO) with significant amplitude causing degraded mission\neffectiveness, possibly leading to structural failure. Specifications\nfor allowable free-play size can be overly conservative. Analytical\ntools are proposed for establishing free-play limits on aeroservoelastic\naircraft systems without adverse consequences, justifying relief, which\nmay otherwise be cost prohibitive or impossible to satisfy. The proposed\ntools include finite element modeling, model order reduction, nonlinear\nsimulation, describing functions, and wavelet transforms. These tools\nwill be integrated into the MatlabTM/SimulinkTM platform. A trade study\nis proposed that compares different free-play modeling techniques. Novel\ntechniques will be used to determine the airspeed range over which limit\ncycles can occur, including the frequency and amplitude of the limit\ncycles. Novel techniques for the inverse problem are also proposed,\nwhereby the free-play size is estimated based on diagnostic\nmeasurements. A general stabilator model will be used in Phase I to\ndevelop the analysis techniques and show feasibility. Wind tunnel test\nverification of the free-play analysis and estimation techniques will be\nconducted in Phase II using existing wind tunnel models and facilities\nat an industrial location.",
