    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Nimbus-7/THIR Level 1 Calibrated Located Radiation Data (CLDT) at 6.7 and 11.5 microns data product contains radiances expressed in units of W/m2/sr measured in the 10.5 - 12.5 (11.5) micron and 6.5 - 7.0 (6.7) micron channels. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from magnetic 9-track tapes. The data are archived in their original proprietary format.\n\nThe Nimbus-7 satellite was successfully launched on October 28, 1978. The Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) experiment on Nimbus-7 is basically identical to its predecessors flown on Nimbus-4, -5 and -6, except that the data were digitized on board. The THIR instrument is a two channel high resolution scanning radiometer designed to perform two major functions:\n\n* 11.5 micron channel provides both day and night cloud top or surface temperatures. The ground resolution at the sub-point is 6.7 km and operates day and night.\n\n* 6.7 micron channel gives information on the moisture content of the upper troposphere and stratosphere and the location of jet streams and frontal systems. The water vapor channel has a resolution of the sub-point is 20 km and operates mostly at night.\n\nThe THIR Principal Investigator was Dr. Larry L. Stowe from NOAA NESDIS. The Nimbus-7 THIR data are available from October 30, 1979 (day of year 303) through May 13, 1985 (day of year 133).\n\nThese data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC under the entry ID ESAD-00107 (old id: 78-098A-10C).",
