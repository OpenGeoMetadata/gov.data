    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Technologies include, but are not limited to, electric and advanced chemical propulsion, propellantless propulsion such as aerocapture and solar sails, sample return ascent vehicles, and Earth return systems. \n\nISP will enable access to more challenging and interesting science destinations, including enabling sample return missions. ISP continues to advance several propulsion technologies in support of future Flagship, Discovery, Mars, and New Frontiers missions. The ISP portfolio continues to invest in high-priority technology areas such as the electric propulsion and aerocapture/Earth entry, descent, and landing technologies identified in the Solar System Exploration Roadmap, the 2010 SMD Science Plan, and the 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey.  The ISP project is highly responsive to the Decadal Survey.\n\nThe ISP project will complete the 7kW NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) Power Processing Unit (PPU) repair in 2012, and will complete NEXT PPU characterization and integration testing and long duration validation testing of the NEXT thruster in 2013. ISP is completing the electric propulsion 4kW High Voltage Hall Accelerator (HiVHAC) thruster development task, is assessing commercial Hall systems, and will start long duration testing of the HIVHAC thruster in 2012. The Hall system power processing unit (PPU) and other subsystem technology development starts development in FY 2012.  High Voltage Hall Accelerator (HiVHAC) thruster technology is applicable to Earth return vehicles (ERV), transfer stages, and low-cost electric propulsion systems for Discovery-class missions. In FY 2012 ISP will continue development of NDI techniques and a detailed design for a lightweight propellant tank applicable to the Skycrane. ISP will continue completing Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV ) heat shield micro-meteoroid/orbital debris characteristics studies, a preliminary design of a multi-mission Earth entry vehicle (MMEEV) concept and continuing MMEEV technology development.",
