  "notes": "  Description:   Large &amp;quot;Truck&amp;quot; Chamber  The large &amp;quot;truck&amp;quot; chamber provides controlled air conditions from -7 &amp;#176;C (20 &amp;#176;F) to 65 &amp;#176;C (150 &amp;#176;F).  Air-Conditioner and Heat Pump Test Chambers  The indoor chamber can provide controlled air conditions for all ARI heating and cooling tests for split-systems, window units, and other unitary equipment throughout the range of 10 &amp;#176;C (50 &amp;#176;F) to 60 &amp;#176;C (140 &amp;#176;F) dry-bulb temperature with relative humidity controlled within &amp;#177;2 %.   Small Appliance and Refrigerator Chamber  This chamber is used to test small heating and cooling equipment such as radiators, heat exchangers, water coolers, refrigerators, and control devices.  Specifications / Capabilities:   Large &amp;quot;Truck&amp;quot; Chamber  The conditioning equipment can remove up to 35 kW (120 000 Btu/h) of heat at a dry-bulb temperature of 35&amp;#176;C (95&amp;#176;F) and 50 % relative humidity. Full range dry-bulb temperature control of &amp;#177; 1&amp;#176;C (2&amp;#176;F) with relative humidity control better than &amp;#177; 2 % is possible. At ARI heating and cooling conditions, control of dry-bulb and dewpoint temperatures are better than 0.1 &amp;#176;C (0.2 &amp;#176;F).   Air-Conditioner and Heat Pump Test Chambers  The outdoor chamber has a temperature range capability from -18&amp;#176;C (0 &amp;#176;F) to 60 &amp;#176;C (140 &amp;#176;F) with relative humidity controlled within &amp;#177; 2%. At ARI heating and cooling conditions, control of dry-bulb and dewpoint temperatures are better than 0.1&amp;#176;C (0.2&amp;#176;F). Units with cooling capacities up to 35 kW (120 000 Btu/h) may be tested.   Small Appliance and Refrigerator Chamber  Dry-bulb temperature may be controlled from -18&amp;#176;C (0&amp;#176;F) to 65&amp;#176;C (150&amp;#176;F) with relative humidity controlled within &amp;#177; 2% of setpoint. At ARI heating and cooling conditions, control of dry-bulb and dewpoint temperatures are better than 0.1&amp;#176;C (0.2&amp;#176;F). Maximum heat removal from this chamber is 11.7 kW (40 000 Btu/h).  ",
