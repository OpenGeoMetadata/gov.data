    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of Phase 2 is to build a reliable, lightweight, programmable, multi-mode, miniaturized EVA Software Defined Radio (SDR) that supports data telemetry, voice, standard and high-definition video.  The proposed radios would be part of an advanced, incrementally expandable wireless network for securing and accessing lunar data assets. For improved reliability and to assure stand-alone functionality, the network would support a real-time 3D location function using site-assisted navigation and utilizing TOA/TDOA methods.  To achieve unparalleled power consumption efficiency, Lexycom proposes the use of QoS-aware, data traffic dependent waveform selection.  We have estimated that additional reduction in power consumption can be obtained by utilizing cognitive selection of the operating mode of the EVA transceivers.  We plan to use an innovative RF packetization technique targeted toward eliminating negotiations between the network nodes prior to the change in the parameters of the transmitted signal on a packet-by-packet basis.  We anticipate that after the completion of Phase II, Lexycom will be more than capable of delivering production-ready operational EVA SDR prototypes for further advancements in the transceiver's Technology Readiness Level (TRL).  We strongly believe that such radio would facilitate flexibility, provide consistent functionality, and reduce implementation time for future NASA planetary explorations.",
