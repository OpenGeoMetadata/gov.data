    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Level-1B (L1B) Radiance Product OML1BRUG (Version-3) from the Aura-OMI is now available to public (http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/oml1brug_v003.shtml) from the NASA GSFC Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).\n      \n      OMI calibrated and geolocated radiances for the channels in the UV1(264-311 nm), UV2 (307-383 nm) and VIS (349-504) regions, spectral irradiances, calibration measurements, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products are archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC.\n      \n      (The shortname for this OMI Level-1B Product is OML1BRUG) \n\t    The lead algorithm scientist for this product is Dr. Marcel Dobber from the KNMI.      \n      \n      This Radiance product contains geolocated Earth view spectral radiances from the UV detectors in the wavelength range of 264 to 383 nm. In the standard global measurement mode, OMI observes 60 ground pixels (13 km x 24 km at nadir) across the swath for each of the 557 channels of UV2 (307-383 nm) and 30 ground pixels (13 km x 48 km at nadir) for the 159 channels of UV1 (264-311 nm). \n      \n      Once a month in one orbit OMI performs dark measurements, it does not perform radiance measurements.\n      \n      In addition, OMI performs spatial zoom measurements one day per month. For that day, this product also contains UV2 measurements that are rebinned from the spatial zoom-in measurements. In original spatial zoom mode the nadir ground pixel size is 13 x 12 km and measurements are available only for the UV2 and VIS wavelengths (306 to 432 nm). \n       \n       OML1BRUG files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS 2.4) which is based on HDF4.  The radiance for the earth measurements (also referred as signal) and its precision are stored as a 16 bit mantissa and an 8-bit exponent. The signal can be computed using the equation: signal = signal_mantissa x 10 exponent . For the precision, the same exponent is used as for the signal. Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes) and is roughly 484 MB in size. There are approximately 14 orbits per day.",
