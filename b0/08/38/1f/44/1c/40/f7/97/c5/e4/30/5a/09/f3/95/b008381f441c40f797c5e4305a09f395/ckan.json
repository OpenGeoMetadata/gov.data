  "notes": "The MN Department of Agriculture (MDA) is charged with periodically collecting and analyzing water samples from selected locations throughout the state to determine the identity, concentration, and frequency of detections of agricultural chemicals in Minnesota's ground and surface water resources. This file contains the locations of surface water monitoring stations that have been monitored, either historically or currently. MDA divides these sites into three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. These categorizations can change over time based on the monitoring results from the previous year. Tier 1 sites are sampled 4 times from mid-May to mid-July, Tier 2 sites are sampled up to 8 times per year from mid-May to mid-July, and Tier 3 can be sampled an unlimited number of times within a year. Results from this sampling can be found in yearly reports at: http://www.mda.state.mn.us/chemicals/pesticides/maace.htm Historical sites consist of locations that were sampled May, June and July (at most locations) from 1991 to 1993. Samples were collected by the MPCA and analyzed by the MDA Lab. Results from these samples were reported in the 1996 Common Detection Data Report by MDA.",
