    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The uncertainty quantification methods developed under this program are designed for use with current state-of-the-art flow solvers developed by and in use at NASA.  The Phase I program demonstrated the CRISP CFD&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; error quantification and reduction code with simulations conducted using the NASA unstructured solvers FUN3D and USM3D.  Phase I provided evidence supporting the suspected need for an error prediction code that matches the finite volume scheme of the Navier-Stokes solver itself.  Phase II will continue this work by expanding our Error Transport Equation (ETE) solver to treat both classes of unstructured grid finite volume schemes.  Support for the CGNS standard will be implemented and permit use of the Phase II product by a broader spectrum of potential users.  Specific issues that affect numerical accuracy of the error predictions and how they propagate into integrated quantities such as lift and drag coefficients will be addressed.  Reduction of error for large scale meshes is a matter of equal importance, and improvements are planned that will provide for anisotropic grid refinement within the existing CRISP CFD&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; mesh adaptation code.  Finally, error quantification approaches for transient applications will be explored to expand these developments to problems that involve inherent unsteadiness and/or moving boundaries.",
