    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Program, Syscom Technology, Inc. will implement an integrated processing scheme to fabricate a conductive multifunctional high-strength, high-modulus Metal/Polymer Composite Fiber (MPCF) for power and signal transfer and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications in space and aerospace vehicles. The Phase I study has successfully demonstrated that High phosphorous Electroless Nickel (HPEN) can be readily deposited onto properly etched PBO fiber. The HPEN coated PBO fiber showed the superior mass retaining (31.5 to 38.5) characteristic comparing to that of the uncoated PBO fiber in atomic oxygen erosion test. Additionally, the tensile mechanical strength and the DC conductivity of the MPCF essentially unchanged after a fluence of 5.04x1020 (atoms/cm2) atomic oxygen. In Phase II program, the revised processing scheme enables a full control of the processing conditions, such as fiber tension, bath chemistry during each step of the fiber preparation leading to the optimization of the mechanical and electrical properties of the PBO fiber. It is anticipated that the metal coating will not only protect the underlining polymer from harsh space environment, but also affords the resulting MPCF with advantages over metal wires in weight savings, mechanical flexibility, durability and strength.",
