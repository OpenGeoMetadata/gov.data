    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Data were collected in the logging concession at the Fazenda Rohsamar in the municipality of Juruena in northwestern Mato Grosso.  Estimates of damage associated with logging operations were made after logging operations were complete in 2003 and 2004. Damage associated with gaps created by felling single trees was estimated in 54 individual gaps. Characteristics of the single harvested tree were recorded and included species, DBH, commercial height, total height, and canopy proportions.  Damage to all surrounding trees was recorded. Stratified transects in two logging blocks were used to estimate damage associated with road building and skid trails. Twenty-six transects were established in Block 5 and 21 transects in Block 18 to assess the frequency of damage by log skidders and tree felling. The boundaries between different types of damage were noted along the transect  and the length in meters of that damage type along the transect was recorded. From this information, the area of the logging block affected by road building and skid trails was determined.The Gap Survey and the Logging Damage Transects Survey data are provided in comma-separated ASCII files. A third file provides the coordinates of the starting points for the Survey Transects.  ",
