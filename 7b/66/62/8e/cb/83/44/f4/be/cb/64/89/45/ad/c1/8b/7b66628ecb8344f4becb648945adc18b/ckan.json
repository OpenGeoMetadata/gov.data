    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Conceptual existence of circumnavigation routes was speculated in the proposing team&amp;rsquo;s Phase I NIAC research, but at that time terrain model resolution was too low to enable accurate route-finding, and fidelity of terrain knowledge was too low for validation of route existence. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Messenger missions have changed that fact: detailed surface maps now exist for the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and some asteroids, and the time is right for a great leap of viability for the visionary concept of Nomadic Exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed research will discover and characterize the first Nomadic Routes to encircle planets, dwell at peaks, and circumnavigate asteroids. Research thrusts in sensing and planning technologies for rover energetics, speed, and autonomy will make the great leaps necessary for Nomadic expeditions like equatorial circumnavigation. Magellan Routes on the Moon will be discovered by applying resource-aware planning methodology to terrain, solar, and thermal data acquired in recent missions. These concepts will be extended to asteroids with slow orbital periods that might allow for sun following in very low gravity and for seasonal polar missions to Mars. Demonstration of critical concepts will occur in simulated and physical test-beds tuned to emulate the parameters of terrain, illumination, temperature and gravity essential for these missions.&lt;/p&gt;",
