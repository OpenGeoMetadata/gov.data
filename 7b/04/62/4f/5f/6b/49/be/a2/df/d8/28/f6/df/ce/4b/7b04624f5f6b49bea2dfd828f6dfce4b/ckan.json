  "notes": "From Kristofik Thesis:Vegetative surveys were conducted within a 25 m-radius plot centered on each surveypoint. The protocol used was developed as part of a state-wide comprehensive monitoringprogram (A. Silvano, pers. comm). The site was categorized into one of four habitats based onobservation: river, field, forest, or forest-stream. A river was a large body of water and classifiedas navigable; while a stream was typically a smaller body of water and not navigable. Thehabitat designated as forest-stream had a stream running through the forested site, while a forestsite had no aquatic resources within the plot. In addition, any sites that were predominantlymountain longleaf pine or restoration sites with young pines were noted. Sites were separatedfurther into types of forest: pine, hardwood, or mixed. A grid of sampling points 6.25 m apartand aligned in the cardinal directions was established for 49 points/ plot. At each point, amoosehorn densitometer (GRS Densitometer, Geographic Resource Solutions, Arcata,California) was used to determine cover of canopy, mid-story, reproductive shrubs, andherbaceous shrubs. Estimates of cover types were based on percentage of points where eachrespective type of cover was present. Average height of the canopy was calculated using theheights of three dominant trees in the plot. In each plot, the tallest trees of the most abundantspecies were selected as the dominant trees and measured. The measurements were thenaveraged to determine the average height of the canopy. For each tree, total height, height to thefirst live branch, and proximity to center were recorded. Measurements were obtained using ameasuring tape (15 or 30 m), compass, and a clinometer. Each tree was flagged 2 m above theground and photographed, so that measurements could be validated. In addition, I recordedspecies, DBH, and distance to center of plot for each snag within the plot. A basal area anglegauge (Panama angle gauge, Panama Pump Company, Hattiesburg, Mississippi) was used toestimate basal area. For each tree indicated by the prism from the center of the plot, I notedspecies, DBH, and distance to center of the point.",
