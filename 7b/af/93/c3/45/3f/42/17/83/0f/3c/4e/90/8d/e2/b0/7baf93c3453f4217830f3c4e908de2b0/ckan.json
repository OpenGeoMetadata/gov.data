    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "To address NASA's need for L1 C/A-based navigation with better anti-spoofing ability and higher accuracy, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new Navigation Robustness and Accuracy Improvement (NRAI) system, based on BCI's innovative noise nulling and observable combiner technology. BCI's novel approach incorporates the innovations of the highly successful multiple-antenna detection technique and the optimized fast quad diversity combiner technique, enabling BCI to meet NASA's requirements for reliability, safety, and high accuracy by effectively nullifying the interference noise from GPS receiver data and eliminating errors and ambiguities in observables. The NRAI system offers a 4-6 dB SNR improvement factor over current techniques and increases the accuracy of L1 C/A navigation to less than 1 m and 1 cm/s, which directly fulfills NASA's requirement of anti-spoofing ability and high accuracy. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of the NRAI system by building and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate TRL-level 3-4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the anti-spoofing and high-accuracy navigation performance of NRAI. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capabilities of accurate and reliable navigation using L1 C/A code.",
