    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tAn ultra-compact superconducting on-chip-spectrometer has the potential to revolutionize far-IR through millimeter-wave observational astronomy and astrophysics, allowing for the first time wide-field mm- and sub-mm spectral surveys and efficient follow up observations of known sources. Our ultimate plan is to use planar lithography to fabricate superconductin g transmission line filters to sort incident radiation by frequency to an array of direct detectors such as MKIDs. However, for this task, we are only focusing on the antenna array element and coupling structures which will couple energy from the telescope to the spectrometer chip. We will design and fabricate a 2x2 array of multi-flare-angle smooth walled horn array to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept for the spectrometer-on-a-chip as well as other focal plane arrays in the submillimeter-wave frequency band. The 2x2 horn array antennas will be fabricated using a tool which can make hundreds of arrays of horn antennas without much difficulty. This is the key innovation of this approach. The horn array will be designed for the 190-320 GHz frequency band. We will also design and fabricate a 2x2 array of circular to rectangular transition block which will be used to test the performance of the horn array. Fig. 1 shows the design concept and that fabrication tool that will enable fabrication of antenna arrays with hundreds of pixels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
