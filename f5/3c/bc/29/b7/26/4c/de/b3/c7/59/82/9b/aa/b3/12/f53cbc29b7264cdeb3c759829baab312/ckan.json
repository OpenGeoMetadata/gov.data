    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Daylight Solutions proposes a miniaturized sensor package based on ECqcL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; and QEPAS technology that were independently developed by Daylight Solutions (San Diego, California) and the Laser Science Group Laboratory at Rice University (Houston, Texas)\r\n\r\nECqcL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; lasers and QEPAS detectors have been successfully combined into table-top experiments, and the detection of several atmospheric gases in the low ppb range has been demonstrated. ECqcL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; based portable sensors have also been used to demonstrate the detection of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues at atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\r\n\r\nThe ECqcL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt;-QEPAS technique involves tightly focusing an infrared laser beam between the prongs of a commercial quartz tuning fork (QTF). Absorption of the laser emission by the sample heats up the gas between the prongs of the QTF. The resulting pressure spike is detected as an electrical signal due to a deformation of the prongs that results in a charge separation on electrodes deposited on the QTF prongs. Acoustically a QTF is a quadrupole, which results in excellent environmental noise immunity.\r\n\r\nBy scanning the laser over a wide tuning range, the spectra of multiple atmospheric gas species can be recorded using only a single laser. The QEPAS technique does not require a sample chamber and air volumes as small as 1 mm3 containing atmospheric concentrations of 12CO2, 13CO2, CO, CH4, NO2, H2O2, H2CO, O3, and bromine oxides can be measured with ppb sensitivity.\r\n\r\nBoth QEPAS and ECqcL&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; technologies are amenable to miniaturization, monolithic construction, and mass production following a straightforward engineering path using established MEMS technologies. The result would be a small, battery-operated, rugged sensor package that can be mass produced at low cost. The sensor would be insensitive to environmental factors and deployment platform independent. Wireless communication, self-calibration, and remote servicing are inherent components of such a miniaturized monolithic sensor package.",
