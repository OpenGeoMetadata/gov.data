  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Aviation Information Systems Development Laboratory (AISDL) provides the tools, reconfigurability and support to ensure the quality and integrity of new system capabilities prior to production delivery to the ship. Specifically, the lab is essential to the integration of Aviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS) and Moriah Wind Systems (MWS) with Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) systems. The lab provides the ideal 360-degree man-machine interface by allowing developers to access new systems from above, below, front, back and side.  Function:  Located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, the AISDL offers a variety of capabilities such as design verification, software verification, system integration, functional testing and complete system check-out prior to a ship&amp;#39;s installation and deployment. The lab&amp;#39;s interconnectivity capability with multiple user workstations allows for full system check-out and verification.  Capabilities:  Prior to deployment, the AISDL has the capability to perform a variety of critical pre-installation events to ensure safe and efficient operations. These critical pre-installation events include: Design Verification Testing (DVT), Functional Qualification Testing (FQT), Operational Assessment (OA) and Quality Assurance (QA). In addition, the lab can support the integration of special design equipment to accommodate the design and development of new programs/technology or changes to existing ones. Equipped with special power outlets, the AISDL can also accommodate any shipboard and shore-based power requirement.  ",
