    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "DyMA-FM (Dynamic Multivariate Assessment for Fault Management) is a software architecture for real-time fault management. Designed to run in a distributed environment, DyMA-FM enables model-based reasoning and predictive modeling for FM applications. With the appropriate hardware, DyMA-FM can respond to signals at the device level while still placing each signals in context with the larger system and the overall mission objective. This functionality is enabled by a layered software architecture and decision-making hierarchy where each level receives signals from the level below and context from the level above. The contextual processing reduces false alarms and increases fault coverage. The distributed architecture, meanwhile, speeds processing time and reduces the burden on the communication system, enabling faster and more robust response to fault conditions. \r\n\r\nBuilding on our current and past experience with distributed system management and mathematical modeling, we will implement and test a prototype of the proposed software. Test data will be provided by Boeing Corporation and will consist of a representative set of signals from an actual spacecraft, collected either under actual use conditions or during a system test. Implementation will require the development of mathematical models that represent the relationships between the test signals, and this portion of the Phase I tasks will result in an analysis of the model's ability to support fault detection and management. Testing will focus on the software's fault coverage, the speed of the system responses, and the system's sensitivity to timing issues such as message lag and message collision. Results from initial tests will be reviewed, and suggested changes to the software will be documented. \r\n\r\nThe final output from the project will include the system prototype, test results, and an analysis of the DyMA-FM's ability to produce superior fault coverage.",
