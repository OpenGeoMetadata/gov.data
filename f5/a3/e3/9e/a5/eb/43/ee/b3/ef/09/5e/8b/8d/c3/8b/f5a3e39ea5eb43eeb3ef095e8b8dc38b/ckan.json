  "notes": "This digital dataset contains 61 sets of annual streamflow gains and losses between 1961 and 1977 along Central Valley surface-water network for the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM). The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the USGS's numerical modeling code MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid and others, 2006). This simulation is referred to here as the CVHM (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003. The total active modeled area is 20,334 square-miles. The CVHM includes complex surface-water management processes. The hydrology of the present-day Central Valley and the CVHM model are driven by surface-water deliveries and associated groundwater pumpage. The Streamflow Routing Package (SFR1) is linked to MODFLOW-FMP to facilitate the simulated conveyance of surface-water deliveries. If surface-water deliveries do not meet the farm-delivery requirement, the FMP invokes simulated groundwater pumping to meet the demand. The surface-water network represents a subset of the entire stream network in the valley. Quantitative observations of streamflow gains and losses were available for 57 reaches of 20 major stream systems in the Central Valley for water years 1961-77 (Mullen and Nady, 1985). These observations were included in parameter estimation process and in the model-fit statistics. The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see \"Foreword\", Chapter A, page iii, for details).",
