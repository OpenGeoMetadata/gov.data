    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This project made use of two computational photography techniques, high dynamic range (HDR) imagery formulation and bilateral filters to enable novel imaging applications in support of developing a low light level imaging capability to improve imagery. HDR imaging is a technique that generates an image with a greater dynamic range than ordinarily achievable given an imaging system&amp;rsquo;s hardware architecture. &amp;nbsp;HDR images are generated by acquiring multiple images of the same scene at different exposure settings. Each individual image contains a collection of properly exposed pixels and pixels that are both dark (underexposed) and saturated (overexposed). HDR image products are generated by combining multiple frames of data at different exposure times such that the darkest areas within a frame are imaged with the longest exposure time and the brightest areas within a frame are imaged with the shortest exposure time.&amp;nbsp; This technique can be very powerful when processing imagery acquired under low light level conditions. &amp;nbsp;Standard imagery acquired under low light often contains a significant number of pixels that are extremely dark whereby information content is lost in the shadows. Bilateral filters reduce the noise in relatively uniform areas within an image while minimizing blurring of edges and other spatial features. Edge preserving noise reduction filters are important for improving the imagery of poorly lit scenes. These filters can be used to improve the quality of imagery acquired under low light level conditions. This type of filter preserves edges by only allowing pixels with&amp;nbsp;similar radiometric values to be included in the spatial filter. By looping through each pixel within an image and assigning weights to adjacent pixels, the entire image is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, implementation of the bilateral filter can be computationally intensive, so alternative algorithms that rely on approximations were developed. The bilateral filter described above was implemented in Matlab&amp;reg; and a simple simulated edge target image was constructed to functionally test the algorithms. For both sets of images noise levels (2&#37; and 4&#37;), and the bilateral filter results were more pronounced as light level and image quality decreased. By using these two computational photography techniques, representative HDR image products with imagery acquired under extreme low light conditions were successfully produced.&lt;/p&gt;",
