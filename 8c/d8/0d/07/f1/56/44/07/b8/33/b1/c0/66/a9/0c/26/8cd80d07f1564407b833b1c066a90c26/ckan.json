    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Silicon Carbide deep UV detectors can achieve large gains, high signal-to-noise ratios and solar-blind operation, with added benefits of smaller sizes, lower operating voltages, radiation hardness, ruggedness and scalability. The design, fabrication and optimization of SiC UV APDs is challenging due to some material defects, relatively not-well modeled device operation, and very high absorption coefficients near 100nm wavelengths. These challenges can be overcome with detailed co-modeling, characterization, design and fabrication. Successfully operating SiC UV detectors are of utmost importance for astronomy, space exploration, upper atmosphere monitoring, and systems such as Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) communication.\r\n\r\nThrough Phase I and Phase II, we propose to develop Silicon Carbide (SiC) based UV detectors for space applications. The initial target is the 100nm to 300nm wavelength range, with the peak responsivity expected to be within the 200nm-300nm interval. For the 100nm-200nm wavelength range, we will experiment with the use of an AlGaN cap-layer as the absorber and SiC as the multiplier.\r\n\r\nPhase I effort will focus on the design and detailed physics based simulation of these SiC APD structures. We will use SiC UV detectors fabricated by the GE Global Research Center and AlGaN APDs from University of Maryland for measurements and calibration. ",
