The name, address, phone number and geospatial location for 90% of the entities were completely verified by TGS. The locations for the balance of the entities were assigned using automated methods. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute the oldest record dates from 09/25/2006 and the newest record dates from 10/02/2006.",
