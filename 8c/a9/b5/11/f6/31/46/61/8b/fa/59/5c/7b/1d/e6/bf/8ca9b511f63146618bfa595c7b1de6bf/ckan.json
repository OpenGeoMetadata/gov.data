  "notes": "This data set consists of digital hydraulic conductivity values for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Beaver-North Canadian River from the panhandle to Canton Lake in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 830 square miles of the Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer consists of poorly sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz sand with minor amounts of clay, silt, and basal gravel. The hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits unconformably overlie the Tertiary-age Ogallala Formation and Permian-age formations. Six zones of ranges of hydraulic conductivity values for the alluvial and terrace deposits reported in a ground-water modeling report are used in this data set. The hydraulic conductivity values range from 0 to 160 feet per day, and average 59 feet per day. The features in the data set representing aquifer boundaries along geological contacts were extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set based on a scale of 1:250,000. The geographic limits of the aquifer and zones representing ranges of hydraulic conductivity values were digitized from folded paper maps, at a scale of 1:250,000 from a ground-water modeling report. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

Lines representing the geographic limits of the aquifer were digitized from a folded paper map (30 inches by 22 inches) at a scale of 1:250,000 from Davis and Christenson (1981, plate 7). The lines digitized from the source map had a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.018 map inches (0.046 centimeters) or 377.76 feet (115.14 meters) ground distance. Boundaries represented at these scales are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity measurements made in wells or in cores will range over several orders of magnitude, even over short horizontal and vertical distances. Hydraulic conductivity values derived from ground-water flow models represent areal generalizations and do not reflect the large local variance in well or core measurements.\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
