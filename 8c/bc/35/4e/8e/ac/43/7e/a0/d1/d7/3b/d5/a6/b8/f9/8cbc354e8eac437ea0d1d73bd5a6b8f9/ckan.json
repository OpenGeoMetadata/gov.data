    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"&gt;Prior to electrolysis, the water generated as an intermediate product must be treated to remove absorbed hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, byproducts derived from trace amounts of fluoride and chloride present in lunar regolith. In terrestrial applications, removal of chloride and fluoride from water is a relatively trivial process due to the availability of consumable adsorbents, or by utilizing other processes that require frequent regeneration. None of these processes are applicable in the lunar environment, however, where resources are scarce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously studied Nafion, a commercially-available sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene polymer membrane, as an ISRU filtration material because it can continuously facilitate water transport and acid rejection without the need for replacement or regeneration. While Nafion showed promise as a filtration membrane, it was unable to remove sufficient quantities of contaminants, particularly fluoride, and would require very large membrane contact areas to generate appreciable quantities of clean water. Electrodialysis was chosen as an alternative water purification process for the present study, due to its extensive industrial pedigree and demonstrated ability to rapidly produce a clean water supply and concentrated waste brine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodialysis uses the principle of ion exchange. An electrodialysys stack contains alternating cation and anion exchange membranes between two electrodes, with fluid-containing channels between each. Initially contaminated feed (diluent) and initially clean waste (concentrate) solutions are passed through every other chamber as direct current is applied across the electrodes. Anionic contaminants in the diluent solution diffuse across the anion exchange membrane toward the anode (positively charged electrode), while cationic contaminants diffuse across the cation exchange membrane toward the cathode (negatively charged electrode). The ionic species become trapped in the concentrate solution, as the current directs anions toward cation exchange membranes through which they cannot diffuse, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dissolved in water, HCl and HF dissociate into their individual ionic species, i.e. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. As a strong acid, HCl fully dissociates into its respective ions, while HF, a weak acid, only partially dissociates in an equilibrium process. It is therefore expected that HCl will rapidly and nearly completely diffuse from the diluent to the concentrate stream, while HF will diffuse into the concentrate stream more slowly, as the gradual removal of fluoride ions will allow more HF to dissociate and be removed from the diluent stream. It is also expected that as the ion concentration in the concentrate stream increases, osmotic pressure will drive water from the diluent to the concentrate stream over time, reducing the yield of clean water. As a result, experiments focused on optimizing both the quantity of chloride and fluoride ions removed from the diluent stream, and the rapidity of ion transfer.&lt;/p&gt;",
