    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Many space applications rely on the utilization of Light Detection and Raging (LIDAR) techniques.  \r\nA key component of any LIDAR system is the laser source. Single frequency lasers in the 1.5-2.0mm region of the spectrum, with less than 10kHz linewidth, are needed and space qualification of the laser source is the critical requirement for the intended NASA LIDAR applications. \r\n\r\nA novel, single-frequency, low noise planar semiconductor external cavity laser has been developed by Redfern Integrated Optics Inc. (RIO).  Cavity is based by the hybrid integration of an InP gain chip and a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) with waveguide Bragg grating.  The laser performance is characterized by a single-frequency output in the 1550 nm spectral region with a linewidth &lt;3kHz; low phase/frequency noise, low RIN.  Additional testing, analysis, and qualification are necessary for its proper applicability and reliable use in space missions.  \r\n\r\nWe propose to carry out a study of the suitability of PLANEX for space service, and to determine its potential susceptibility to space and radiation effects.  At the end of Phase I, a set of target operational specifications, functional requirements, and associated space qualification protocol will be developed for further Space-Qualified External Cavity Laser (SQECL) based on the PLANEX technology.\r\n\r\nWork plan included analysis of prior information and definition of target specifications, assessment of space environment effects, like radiation and vacuum, determination of current and target TRL, plan and roadmap for Phase II, development of the approach for the re-design and complete space qualification at Phase 2.\r\n",
