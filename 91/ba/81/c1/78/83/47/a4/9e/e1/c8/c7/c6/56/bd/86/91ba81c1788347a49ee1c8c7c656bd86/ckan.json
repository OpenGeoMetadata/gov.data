Herbicide-use estimates in this coverage are reported for each county polygon as acres treated, pounds of active ingredient used, and pounds used per square mile. The herbicide-use estimates provided by Gianessi and Puffer (1991) list acres treated and pounds of active ingredient applied for a given crop in each county for which use has been estimated. Cropping data are from the 1987 Census of Agriculture, and are subject to occasional suppressions of acreage estimates at the county level due to problems of confidentiality and census disclosure rules. The herbicide-use estimates included in this coverage are totals of use on all crops treated in a given county. The polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States, as well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) files representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States (1970).

Eighty-four crops were profiled, resulting in usage estimates for 96 herbicide active ingredients. This coverage contains estimates of use for the sixty-first through the eightieth the most-used herbicides in the conterminous United States. Although crop-acreage data represent the 1987 growing year, the herbicide-use estimates generally reflect 1989 usage amounts (Gianessi and Puffer, 1991). Estimates of herbicide use by county were generated from a combination of data collected from surveys of weed scientists and from surveys of farmers. Herbicide-use profile data were generated from ancillary data sources or were calculated from profiles in neighboring states when no responses to surveys or published reports were available (Gianessi and Puffer, 1991). Sampling and statistics were used to account for nonresponding farm operations. Thus, the information describing crop acreages is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage errors (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989b). Census disclosure rules also prevent the publication of information that would disclose the operation of individual farms. Before herbicide-use estimates entered into this coverage, the total use of individual herbicides on all crops for each county was calculated. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching. Polygons that extend into the water (an ocean or the Great Lakes) should be considered arbitrary.\", \"Access Constraints: (describe any restrictions or legal prerequisites for accessing the data set.
