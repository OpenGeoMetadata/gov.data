    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As processing and manufacturing facilities quickly progress from barcode to radio-frequency (RFID) and similar technologies to track the movements of resources (tools, parts, support equipment), many related opportunities to cut costs and increase safety by reducing human error are emerging. We propose to research and develop AreaAdvisor, an AI software system that manages this new tracking data, featuring an innovative spatial scheduler and data mining capabilities.\r\n\r\nAreaAdvisor will allow KSC planners to schedule resources to personnel and 2d space within facilities, and then catch errors immediately as they occur (non-arrivals, resource scanned in incorrect area/by wrong personnel, etc.) The scheduling algorithms will allow planners to use available spaces more optimally (e.g. less frequently used resources stored farther back in dwell areas.) The tool will also employ Bayesian technologies to probabilistically infer the whereabouts of missing resources (even tools without id tags; e.g., drill bits) based on patterns discovered in their usage and location history. \r\n\r\nAreaAdvisor will have an intuitive, visual interface that allows users to edit schedules and layout resources within critical areas interactively with mouse or pen-tablet devices. \r\n",
