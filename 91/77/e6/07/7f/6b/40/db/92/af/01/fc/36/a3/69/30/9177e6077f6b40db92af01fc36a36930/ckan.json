  "notes": "_Abstract:_  Annual average wind resource potential for the state of Arizona at a 50 meter height. This dataset will be replaced when the southwest region has been completed, and the data may change when this region has been completed.\r\n\r\n_Purpose:_  Provide information on the wind resource development potential within the state of Arizona.\r\n\r\n_Supplemental Information:_  This data set has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants. However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development projects. This shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution, in a UTM zone 12, datum WGS 84 projection system.\r\n\r\nOther Citation Details:  The wind power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").
