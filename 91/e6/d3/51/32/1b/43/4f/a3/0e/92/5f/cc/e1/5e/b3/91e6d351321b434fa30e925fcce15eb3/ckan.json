    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tWe had two objectives in this task: 1. Develop effective single low-mass, low-power piezoelectric drive that can actuate rotary-hammer samplers through walls. 2. Determine design sensitivities and investigate Acoustic Mechanical Feed-throughs (AMF) using acoustic mode conversion with emphasis on extension to rotary. In our earlier studies, we were able to excite rotation from longitudinal vibrations but, without sufficient analytical foundations, it has been a challenge to get consistent results. Therefore, we focused our efforts on the modeling, analysis and optimization of configurations that effectively convert longitudinal forces to torque and rotation. The task consisted of conceiving drive configurations and optimizing them thru finite element and harmonic analysis, as well as producing and demonstrating the physical mechanism. The analytical task provided tools and data to select highly efficient mechanisms that use piezoelectric materials to generate elastic waves that wirelessly transmit power through a metallic wall. We produced a resonant breadboard system that converts high frequency micron-size displacements to macroscopic rotary and linear motions. The developed mechanism uses the converse piezoelectric effect as a means of generating elastic waves, which is transmitted in the form of elastic waves, was used to excite rotation through a wall and establish a basis for a systematic capability to design wireless actuation, manipulation, and deployment thru walls. Efforts were made to optimize the location of the nodal plane of the transducer and difficulties were encountered since the nodal location of the transducer is not necessarily a plane. Through our analytical studies, we were able to produce Acoustic Mechanical Feed-throughs (AMF) capability that consistently and efficiently induces rotation. We established sufficient data and analysis to allow submittal of a credible proposal for further development of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
