    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As 'fly-by-wire' technologies become more prevalent in the aerospace systems, the need to develop innovative monitoring, diagnostic and fault tolerant techniques for the electrical systems is becoming obvious.  Among all the possible electrical system failures, two types of failures are considered the most frequent, and hence most critical: intermittent disconnection in connectors, and capacitance failures.  Despite the extreme care in the design and quality control in manufacturing and installation of these connectors in avionics and military equipment, there are increasing number of problems associated with the physical connectivity that ranges from intermittent discontinuities, sparks, and breakages. As for the capacitors, the power systems in modem aircrafts, specifically the ones with DC power supply configurations, rely very heavily on banks of capacitors that act as filters. These capacitors (especially of electrolytic type) present high failure rates - with no effective solution for online monitoring available. The proposed research will study detecting fault initiation, fault-to-failure progression, and online monitoring of the critical problems of intermittent disconnection, and capacitance aging and ultimate failures in aircraft power systems. We propose to develop a non-traditional use of wideband differential current sensor to detect capacitor degradation, as well as intermittent disconnection problems. This program is expected to generate useful, accurate and precise diagnostic information impacting the safety and maintenance of critical aircraft power systems.",
