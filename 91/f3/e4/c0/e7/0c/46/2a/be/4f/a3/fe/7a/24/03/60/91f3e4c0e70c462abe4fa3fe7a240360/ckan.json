    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Payload Systems Inc. (PSI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were selected to jointly develop the Rule-based Analytic Asset Management for Space Exploration System (RAMSES) in this NASA STTR project. This system implements a modular layered architecture that enables automated multi-level asset tracking and management for both space and ground applications based on state-of-the-art RFID technology. The main advantages of this system over current bar-code based asset tracking are: (i) significant time savings through automation, (ii) real-time remote status monitoring through the internet, and (iii) rule-based analytics for proactive asset management.\r\n\r\nIn Phase 2 we propose to redesign the Smart Container by taking advantage of Generation 2 RFID tag technology, lightweight RFID readers and batteries as well as integrating container technologies in a more tight and robust manner. We plan to build a total of three (3) smart containers to demonstrate scalability of the system and interaction among containers. The RAILS software will be upgraded to provide enterprise-level capabilities such as user authentication, inventory and item time history analysis, and an expanded analytic rule set. Testing will be conducted both in the laboratory and in the field to demonstrate seamless three level tracking (container level, room level, outdoors). Finally, we will perform a detailed RAMSES cost/benefit analysis and market survey in preparation for Phase 3.\r\n",
