    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA and Boeing Phantom Works have been working on the  Elastically Shaped Future Vehicle Concept (ESFVC) and have shown that aircraft with elastically shaped wings  have great potential to save fuel by minimizing drag. Main feature of the ESFVC is that it uses Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCC-TEF) flight control surfaces to bend &amp; twist the wing to a \"drooped wing\" configuration that was shown capable of achieving drag reduction. However, elastic wings are characterized by reduced stiffness, which may result in lower flutter margins. Hence flutter suppression is an important aspect of the ESFVC. In order to address this technical challenge, SSCI and Boeing Phantom Works propose to design, implement and test an innovative  Drag Identification &amp; Reduction Technology (DIRECT) approach to drag reduction and flutter suppression in flexible-wing aircraft. The approach is based on leveraging prior work by SSCI and includes on-line identification of flutter modes using real-time subspace identification techniques, flutter suppression control law development, and the selection of the optimal control allocation that minimizes drag based on the CFD/FEA analysis. The approach will be tested on aircraft dynamics simulation, developed by Boeing, that includes a large number of relevant flexible modes. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James Urnes, Sr) will provide technical and commercialization support under the project.",
