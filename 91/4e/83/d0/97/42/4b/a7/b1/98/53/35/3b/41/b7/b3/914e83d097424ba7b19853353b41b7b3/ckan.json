This raster was derived from multiple individual species season models. The model also includes spatially-explicit uncertainty estimates represented in another raster dataset. Raster values represent the sum of the predicted relative abundance (individuals sighted per km per 15 minutes) for all modeled species and groups over all seasons in which they were modeled. Abundance was treated as zero for all seasons in which a species or group was not modeled.",
