  "notes": "  After the development and use of the atomic bomb in 1945, the U.S. Government created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1947 as the agency for controlling nuclear materials and developing nuclear weapons.  The AEC created the Nevada Operations Office on March 6, 1962.  The AEC was abolished on January 19, 1975, and replaced with two agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). ERDA was given the mission of administering the nuclear weapons program and carrying out energy research and development programs including operation of the Nevada National Security Site. The NRC mission was, and still is, to regulate use of civilian nuclear materials and license nuclear power plants.  In October, 1977, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) was created to take over ERDA&amp;#39;s functions plus energy functions from other federal agencies. Stronger emphasis was placed on energy conservation and alternative energy sources, such as solar, geothermal, and wind power.  In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was created by Congress as a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear energy. The Nevada Operations Office was renamed the NNSA Nevada Site Office as part of this change.  NNSA maintains and enhances the safety, security, reliability and performance of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing; works to reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction; provides the U.S. Navy with safe and effective nuclear propulsion; and responds to nuclear and radiological emergencies in the U.S. and abroad.
