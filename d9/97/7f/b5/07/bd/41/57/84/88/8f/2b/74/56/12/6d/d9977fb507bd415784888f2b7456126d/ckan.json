  "notes": "Voyageurs National Park (VNP) represents a major concentration site for nesting bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), which are currently listed in Minnesota as a federally threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Despite the increase in numbers and progress toward recovery in Minnesota from DDE years, the bald eagle population at VNP has lagged behind the recovery of other eagle populations. Recent studies have shown that bald eagles in VNP contain elevated concentrations of certain pesticides and industrial contaminants. Elevated concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichloro diphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE), and mercury and other compounds in the prey base may be contributing to the reduced reproductive success in VNP's eagle population. In order to assess the potential route and degree of contaminant exposure of bald eagles at VNP and the relationship of that exposure to reproductive performance, we obtained eaglet plasma and feathers and known preferred prey items (fish and bird) from selected sites in VNP and adjacent exterior sites during the 1993 breeding season for organochlorine and mercury analysis. Eaglet mercury concentrations, but not total PCBs or DDE, differed among the four major lakes within VNP. However, no significant correlations between eaglet tissue and mean five-year productivity for total PCBs, DDE, or total mercury were observed. Total PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were found in significantly higher concentrations in herring gulls than the fish species obtained throughout the park. Mercury concentrations, on the other hand, were found in high concentrations among all of the four species measured. Mercury concentrations, but not total PCBs or organochlorine pesticides, in VNP prey were equal to fish concentrations determined to have the potential to cause adverse effects on bald eagles in the Great Lakes.",
