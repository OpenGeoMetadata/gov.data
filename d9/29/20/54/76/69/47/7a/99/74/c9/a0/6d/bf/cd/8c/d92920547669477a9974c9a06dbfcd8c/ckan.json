Land in agriculture estimates were generated from surveys of all farms where $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. Most of the attributes summarized represent 1987 data, but some information for the 1982 Census of Agriculture also was included. The polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States, as well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) files representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States (1970).

The estimates were constructed from surveys of all farms where $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. Sampling and statistics were used to account for nonresponding farm operations. Thus, the information in the Census of Agriculture is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage errors. Census disclosure rules prevent publication of information that would disclose the operation of individual farms. Thus, for example, one or two sod farms may be reported in a county, but no acreage of sod harvested is reported, because release of that information might disclose information about a particular farmer's operation. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching.
