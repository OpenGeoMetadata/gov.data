Tracts are numbered and created by the regional cartographic staff at the Land Resources Program Centers and are associated to the Land Status Maps. This data should be used to display properties that NPS owns and properties that NPS may have some type of interest such as scenic easements or right of ways. The Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park map layers show surveyed tract parcel data polygons and park boundary lines that represent historical data, ownership, deeds and acreage throughout the park. Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Park is located in the Warren and Shenandoah counties of Virginia. The park is one of the nations newest as it was created on December 19, 2002 and encompasses nearly 3,500 acres across 3 counties. The park includes the key sites of Belle Grove Plantation and Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation lands. Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park shares a nationally significant Civil War landscape. The park area has history from early settlement through the Civil War and beyond. The Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park is full of wonders that represent National Historic Preservation within its boundaries. The digital creation of the park land status maps allows the park mylar sources to be geo-referenced to the real world in a seamless ArcGIS environment.",
