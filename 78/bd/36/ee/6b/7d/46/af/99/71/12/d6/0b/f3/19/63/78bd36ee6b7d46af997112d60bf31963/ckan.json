    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Traditional radiation hardened by process (RHBP) and radiation hardened by design (RHBD) techniques have seen success in mitigating the effects of radiation induced corruption, but are often cumbersome, slow and expensive.  Current RHBP hardening techniques include foundry processing methods which take place at the manufacturing level such as the use of radiation resistant device packaging, radiation doping, and one-time programmable architectures.  To date, RHBP approaches are often unavailable, prohibitively expensive, or too far behind the state of the art for many designers, forcing them to investigate RHBD techniques.  RHBD design methods attempt to mitigate the effects of radiation by integrating principles of redundancy, error correction, and self-testing at multiple levels of the design, including the physical layout of a system function, the programming of the device, and the software running on the device.  Traditional RHBD methods are often flawed when implemented on modern FPGA devices due to unique device architectures and supporting vendor CAD tools.  Luna Innovations Incorporated proposes to develop susceptibility metrics and innovative RHBD methods to minimize the vulnerabilities of reprogrammable FPGAs in radiation prone environments.  Luna will combine these developments into Luna PAR, a software program that optimizes designs for radiation hardening. ",
