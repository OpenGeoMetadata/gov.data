  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Support Equipment (SE) and Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) Design and Analysis Laboratory exists to provide rapid response to SE- and ALRE-related fleet needs through the use of state-of-the-art automated design tools and a team of personnel capable of meeting the complex design and engineering analysis needs of the fleet.  Function:  Located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, the SE &amp;amp; ALRE Design and Analysis Laboratory combines a suite of software packages, high-end workstations for sophisticated modeling and analysis, two 3D printers for rapid prototyping and a dedicated team of personnel to meet the critical fleet requirements on local and national levels.  Capabilities:  Some of the major software packages used in the lab setting include: Pro/ENGINEER, Pro/MECHANICA, AutoCAD, ALGOR Multi Physics, ANSYS CFD and ORCAD. The lab also features two 3D printers which allow for rapid prototyping in an office setting. Through the use of these tools and the leveraging of its personnel&amp;#39;s expertise, the SE &amp;amp; ALRE Design and Analysis Laboratory is able to provide a variety of capabilities such as resolution of software and hardware defects, engineering development, simulations, testing, redesign, on-site troubleshooting of equipment issues, hardware development in support of new or changing engine test requirements, obsolescence management and configuration management.
