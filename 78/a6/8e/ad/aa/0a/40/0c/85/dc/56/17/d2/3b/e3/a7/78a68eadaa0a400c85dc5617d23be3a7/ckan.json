  "notes": "The Census Bureau includes landmarks such as military installations in the MTDB for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations.  In 2012, the Census Bureau obtained the inventory and boundaries of most military installations from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for Air Force, Army, Marine, and Navy installations and from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for Coast Guard installations. \r\n\r\nThe military installation boundaries in this release represent the updates the Census Bureau made in 2012 in collaboration with DoD.",
