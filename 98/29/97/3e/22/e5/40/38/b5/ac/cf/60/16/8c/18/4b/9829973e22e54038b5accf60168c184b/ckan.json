  "notes": "During our investigations along the Upper Mississippi River during 1999 we located Red-shouldered Hawks (Buteo lineatus) in a total of 32 of the 51 areas searched. We confirmed Red-shouldered Hawk nesting in 16 sites; of these, nine nesting attempts were successful (56.25%) producing 19 nestlings for an average of 2.11 nestlings per successful nest and 1.19 per known nesting attempt. We suspect Red-shouldered Hawk nesting in 16 additional sites where we observed territorial activity but could not confirm nesting. We searched eight sites where we found no evidence of Red-shouldered Hawk activity; in five of these sites we had documented Red-shouldered Hawk activity in previous years. Our searches in eleven sites were considered incomplete; we had documented Red-shouldered Hawk activity in five of these eleven sites in previous years. Of the 32 territories where we confirmed or suspected Red-shouldered Hawk nesting along the Upper Mississippi River, fifteen were in Iowa, seven were in Wisconsin, and ten were in Illinois. Of the sixteen confirmed nesting sites, fifteen were on federal land (thirteen on U.S. Fish & Wildlife Refuge Lands and two on Effigy Mounds National Monument property), and one was on private property. Three of the active Red-shouldered Hawk nests were located within the Milan Bottoms/Mill Creek study area; two of these nesting attempts were successful (66.7%), producing six fledgling Red-shouldered Hawks for an average of 3.0 per successful nest and 2.0 per known nesting attempt. Two of these nesting attempts were located within 1/2 mile of the 11 acre timber harvest which was completed in 1994.",
