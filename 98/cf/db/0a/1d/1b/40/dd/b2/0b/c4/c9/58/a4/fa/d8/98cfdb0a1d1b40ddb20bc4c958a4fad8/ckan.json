    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposal is for funding to continue development of an alternative beam combiner for Stellar Imager (SI), a 30-aperture, interferometric telescope chosen as one of fifteen Vision Missions.  Called the Spatial Frequency Remapper, SFR, it trades the large field of view of a Fizeau design for simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Since SI does not require a large field, SFR, is a clearly better design.  It can produce better images and allows tight control requirements to be relaxed.  The SFR is also the heart of a full-aperture interferometric imaging system that will dramatically improve the performance of AO equipped telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I study was remarkably successful.  The SFR design was rejected during the Vision Study because of its perceived optical complexity.  That concern was retired; the design is robust, even with many apertures.  It needs only three optical surfaces, down from the five-surface design of the Vision Study.  Tolerances are not tight.  The inputs can be divided between combiners, further simplifying the optics and data flow with negligible effect on mission performance.\r\n\r\nThe search for better sparse-aperture configurations worked.  The search was sped up 1000 fold, enabling the discovery of the 30-aperture configurations needed for SI.\r\n\r\nThe main commercial application, improving images from AO equipped telescopes, requires a seemingly impossible to build optical fiber interface.  We found an alternative assembly procedure that is standing up well to detailed study.  A data reduction technique was developed that should improve sensitivity by a factor of 1000, increasing the range of possible applications.  The configuration search found ways to divide a full-aperture into the multiple configurations, tying off another loose thread in the design.\r\n\r\nFinally, a testbed and prototyping plan was developed since in our view the success of the Phase I study clearly supports continuing the development of this technology.\r\n",
