  "notes": "This is a double precision polygon dataset delineating the geographic footprint of the 100k series map sheets published by the USGS. Because most of these map sheets have also been scanned into DRGs, this index also represents the area of valid data on 100K DRGs for the area. Because the neatline of paper quad maps was formed by a regular grid in geographic coordinates, NAD27, this dataset was generated from a regular grid defined in that coordinate system. In subsequent processing this grid was projected to geographic coordinates, NAD83. The projection was done to make this dataset compatible with other vector data in the same coordinate system. As a result, the area enclosed by each polygon in this index represents the same geographic area depicted on the corresponding paper map, but the latitude / longitude value for each polygon side and and corner in geographic coordinates, NAD83 are not exact multiples of full and half degrees. The arcs comprising the edges of each polygon were densified with intermediate vertices at 3.75 minute spacings. This will allow the sides of each polygon to curve as necessary under the influence of conic and other projections. The dataset is, for the most part, regular tiles representing a one degree width by half degree height area. The exception to this is the Mississippi River Delta Sheet which had an overedge to the south.",
