  "notes": "This Characterization of Coastal Watershed for St Croix, St. John and St Thomas, US Virgin Islands, is a GIS products suite consisting of layers derived from diverse source data sets and subsequent GIS processes. The layers are: 1. Watershed boundaries (shapefiles), or hydrological units and their physical and erosion related characteristics; 2. Estimated depth represents the relative bathymetry of the U.S. Virgin Islands shallow waters based on Landsat imagery: 3. Indicates the potential threat of sediment delivery and land-based sources of pollution to benthic habitats. This dataset is derived from NOAA's study, the Benthic Habitats of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands: 4. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was created from the existing U.S. Geological Survey, National Elevation Dataset (NED) by filtering artifacts, converting to the NAD83 datum, edge-matching, and sliver filling of missing data. 5. Steepest downhill descent for each raster cell calculated by the Slope function in ArcGIS; 6. Relative erosion rate by land cover type 2000 were determined from a table; 7. Relative erosion rate by land cover type 1990 were determined from a table; 8. Erodibility of soils (Kffact) based upon soil composition derived from the SSURGO soils data base; 9. Mean annual precipitation (mm), derived from climate data collected at weather stations from 1990-2000 (NOAA Monthly Surface Data, NCDC); 10. Maximum monthly precipitation, derived from monthly precipitation for all available weather stations in U. S. V. I. 11. Watershed outflow points, (areas of maximum flow accumulation within hydrological basins) calculated from FLOWDIRECTION and FLOWACCUMULATION which were derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 12. topographic slope for Puerto Rico, derived from the U.S. Geological Survey's National Elevation Dataset using various processing and filtering to improve results; 13. Relative Erosion Potential - 2000 (an indicator of sediment and pollution runoff) derived from USGS National Elevation Dataset, NRCS Soils Database and NOAA Monthly Surface Data; 14. Relative Erosion Potential - 1990 derived from USGS National Elevation Dataset, NRCS Soils Database and NOAA Monthly Surface Data; 15. Potential threat of sediment delivery and land-based sources of pollution to coral ecosystems derived from land cover (LC) database (Created by spectral analysis of consistently orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery), USGS National Elevation Dataset, NRCS Soils Database and NOAA Monthly Surface Data; and 16. Relative vulnerability to erosion - 2000 derived from land cover (LC) database (Created by spectral analysis of consistently orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery), USGS National Elevation Dataset, NRCS Soils Database.",
