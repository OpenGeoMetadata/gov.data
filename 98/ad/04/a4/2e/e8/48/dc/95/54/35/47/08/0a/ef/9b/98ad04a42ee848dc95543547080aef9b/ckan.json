    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In response to Topic S3.04 \"Propulsion Systems,\" Busek Co. Inc. will develop a high throughput Hall effect thruster with a nominal peak power of 1-kW and wide throttling range in terms of both power and Isp.\r\n  \r\nIn Phase I the preliminary thruster design was completed.  Project activities focused on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  The goal is to achieve a propellant throughput greater than 100 kg/kW.  Numerical modeling is playing a critical role in the thruster design.  In Phase I, we used a fluid based code developed by JPL to model the plasma in an existing thruster that is currently undergoing life testing.  The erosion predictions of the model were found to agree well with actual measurements.  The numerical model was then applied to the magnetically shielded 1-kW thruster and preliminary results were found to be reasonable.  The goal is to demonstrate a thruster design where channel erosion is entirely eliminated as a life limiting mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn Phase II, we will build and test the extended lifetime thruster.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Numerical modeling will be used throughout the process to ensure that magnetic shielding is achieved.  Code predictions will be grounded in plasma measurements taken with a variety of diagnostics including channel wall probes, high speed intrusive channel probes, and plume probes.  The ability of the thruster to achieve its lifetime goals will be assessed through a 500 hour wear test.  When the design is finalized, an engineering development unit (EDU) thruster will be designed, built, validated, and delivered to NASA.  The EDU thruster design will be modeled thermally and structurally to facilitate the transition to Phase III.  At the end of the Phase II, the TRL will be 5/6.",
