  "notes": "This dataset is a point file showing GPS trackline data collected during a ShoreZone aerial imaging survey. This flight trackline is recorded at 1-second intervals using Fugawi electronic navigation and is continuously monitored in-flight to ensure all shorelines have been imaged. This dataset is time-synchronized with ShoreZone video imagery and linked by a unique date-time code (yyyymmddhhmmss) so that all imagery can be linked to a spatial location. Software. Positional data are converted to an ESRI shapefile in accordance with the ShoreZone Coastal Habitat Mapping Protocol (2011). ShoreZone is a coastal habitat mapping and classification system in which georeferenced aerial imagery is collected specifically for the interpretation and integration of geomorphic and biological features of the intertidal zone and nearshore environment. Oblique low-altitude aerial video and digital still imagery of the coastal zone is collected during the lowest tides of the year, usually from a helicopter flying at or below 100 m altitude. During image collection, the aircraft's GPS position is continuously recorded so that the video and still imagery have positional information. Video imagery is accompanied by continuous, simultaneous commentary by a geologist and a biologist aboard the aircraft. The imagery and commentary are used in the definition of discrete along-shore coastal habitat units and the mapping of observed physical, geomorphic, sedimentary, and biological across-shore components within those units. Units are digitized as shoreline segments in ArcGIS, then integrated with the along-shore and across-shore geological and biological data attribute tables housed in the geodatabase. Mapped habitat features include degree of wave exposure, substrate type, sediment texture, intertidal biota, and some nearshore subtidal biota.",
