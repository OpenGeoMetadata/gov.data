    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Robots are expected to fulfill an important role in manned exploration operations.  They will perform precursor missions to pre-position resources for manned missions.  They will assist astronauts in site preparation, buildup, and maintenance of a lunar outpost.  To support these roles, new forms of human-robot interaction are needed.  Task-level commanding and predictive interaction are promising for tasks where time delay and limited bandwidth make tele-operations difficult.  Supervised autonomy has potential to make better use of human resources by reducing the mission preparation time for routine tasks.  But these new types of operations require human operators to support new types of tasks.  TRACLabs proposes to develop a software framework that facilitates human-robot teaming.  This software framework will provide tools for human supervisors to use when monitoring the performance and health of robots.  The framework also will assist task coordination by applying operational protocols for information communication and allocation of control during remote distributed operations.  This work is an innovative combination of technologies to support the new human tasks that arise when operating robots at different levels of autonomy.  For performance monitoring, we propose to develop tools for users to define and adjust monitoring conditions, computations, and summaries in response to changing situations and missions.  Additionally we will provide software to aid understanding of operational events and their relationship to underlying data.   To support coordinating tasks, we propose to integrate our existing agent technology for role-based notification using communication protocols with new technology for authorizing the handover of robotic control.  Phase II will produce a software framework for human-robot teaming.  ",
