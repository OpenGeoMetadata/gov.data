    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The hundreds of stream cores in the latest graphics processors (GPUs), and the possibility to execute non-graphics computations on them, open unprecedented levels of parallelism at a very low cost. In the last 6 years, GPUs had an increasing performance advantage of an order of magnitude relative to x86 CPUs. Furthermore, this performance advantage will continue to increase in the next 20 years because of the scalability of the chip manufacturing processes. The goal of this project is to efficiently exploit the GPU parallelism in order to accelerate the execution of a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver. SAT has a wide range of applications, including formal verification and testing of software and hardware, scheduling and planning, cryptanalysis, and detection of security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software. We bring a tremendous expertise in SAT solving, formal verification, and solving of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) by efficient translation to SAT. In our previous work (done on the expenses of our company) we achieved 2 orders of magnitude speedup in solving Boolean formulas from formal verification of complex pipelined microprocessors, 4 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based solving of CSPs, and 8 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based routing of optical networks. During Phase 1 we implemented a prototype of a parallel GPU-based SAT solver that is 1  2 orders of magnitude faster than the best sequential SAT solvers. In Phase 2, we will continue to exploit the GPU parallelism to accelerate SAT solving, and expect to achieve speedup of 3  4 orders of magnitude.",
