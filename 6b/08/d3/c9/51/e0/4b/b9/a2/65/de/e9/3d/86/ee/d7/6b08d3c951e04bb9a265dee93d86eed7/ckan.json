  "notes": "This shapefile represents the annual average depth profile to reach water at a temperature of 20ºC.\r\n\r\nSea water cooling can be used for industrial or residential cooling needs where heat must be rejected. A typical resource for direct air-conditioning applications is no warmer than 8ºC, which has been established as a minimum value of interest for this study. Water at temperatures between 8ºC and 20ºC can be used to supplement air conditioning processes, or to reject heat from many other low temperature industrial processes. Water temperatures above 20ºC were not considered for this investigation as cost savings begin to break down as sea water temperature nears ambient temperatures. Depth profiles for three water temperatures of interest: 8ºC, 14ºC and 20ºC were established to aid selection of optimal sites for sea water cooling. A cool shallow resource just off the coast where a need may exist presents significant opportunity for energy and cost savings.\r\n\r\nData were processed and converted to shapefile format by NREL for the [Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization](http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1055457/1055457.pdf)\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").
