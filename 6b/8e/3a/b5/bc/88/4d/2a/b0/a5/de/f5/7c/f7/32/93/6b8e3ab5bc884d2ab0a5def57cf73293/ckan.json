  "notes": "Nesting females were monitored on the beach between Sandbridge and the North Carolina state line by personnel from the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge (BBNWR). On 30 July 1992 and 12 July 1993 emerging females were allowed to complete nesting, then were constrained to prevent escape. A satellite transmitter was affixed to the carapace of each turtle with plastic resin, a non-invasive procedure. We have utilized this method successfully on over 15 turtles (Keinath, 1993). The turtles were then released at BBNWR on the morning of capture, and movements and behavior were monitored until the transmitters failed.The first head-started loggerhead that was tracked was a turtle orphaned at the Columbus Zoo three years previous to release. Available evidence suggested this turtle was found as a hatchling in SouthCarolina. The turtle was outfitted with a transmitter and released at BBNWR on 4 October 1989. The remaining head-started loggerheads were collected as hatchlings from nests at Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge in 1989 and distributed among the Columbus Zoo and Virginia Marine Science Museum for head-starting. After two years, six of the turtles were selected for attachment of transmitters utilizing the sametechnique as for the nesting females, and five were released on 18 September 1981, and the last head-started turtle was released on 23 October 1991. All head-started turtles were released at BBNWR.Travel routes were plotted and distances traveled and movement speeds were calculated. For turtles which made significant north-south migrations (one nesting female and one head-started juvenile), latitude and transmitter temperature versus date were graphed. Diving behavior was described from data collected by sensors on board the transmitters.",
