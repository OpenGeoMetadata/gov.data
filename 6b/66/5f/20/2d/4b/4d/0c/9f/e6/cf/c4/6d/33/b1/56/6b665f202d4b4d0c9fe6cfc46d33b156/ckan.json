  "notes": "SRF cavities enable accelerators to increase particle beam energy levels while minimizing the use of electrical power by all but eliminating electrical resistance. Future experiments into the origins of the universe and nature of matter will require advanced SRF technology. Facilities for processing and testing SRF cavities, both under tightly controlled R&amp;D conditions and under mass production conditions, are available. Specifically, single and multi-cell cavities from ~100 MHz to 10 GHz can undergo chemical polishing, electropolishing, and mechanical polishing.Cavity de-gassing ovens for 300 MHz cavities or higher frequency operate at up to 1000 &deg;C under high vacuum. High-pressure rinsing with ultra-pure water and class 10 clean rooms for cavity assembly are also available. There is also an industrial laser system for local defect repair, and a replica system for diagnosis of cavity topographical features. Three Vertical Test Stands (VTS) are available at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CTF) for testing bare SRF cavities. The cryostats are configured to operate with a saturated helium bath cooling, 1.4 K minimum temperature and maximum steady power dissipation of 250 W at 2.0K. The VTS cryostats are magnetically shielded and include a radiation shield lid. They are equipped with RF power systems, DAQ Systems, Thermometry, and the Cryostat Control System. Presently the RF power system supports frequencies of 325 MHz, 650 MHz, and 1.3 GHz.Two Horizontal Test Stands (HTS) are also available for testing complete cavities with He vessels, couplers, and tuners. In collaboration with other laboratories and industrial partners, Fermilab is in the forefront of new SRF technology development, including the development of new materials, coatings, and precision fabrication techniques that may have application in many other industries.
