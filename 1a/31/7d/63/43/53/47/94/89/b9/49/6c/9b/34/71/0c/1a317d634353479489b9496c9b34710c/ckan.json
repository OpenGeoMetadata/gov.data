  "notes": "The first Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite called Terra (previously AM-1) was launched on December 18, 1999. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is one of the five state-of-the-art instrument sensor systems on-board Terra (built by METI) with a unique combination of wide spectral coverage and high spatial resolution in the visible near-infrared through shortwave infrared to the thermal infrared regions. Images are acquired in 14 spectral bands using three separate telescopes and sensor systems. These include three visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m), six short-wave-infrared (SWIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 30m, and five thermal infrared (TIR) bands that have a spatial resolution of 90 m. VNIR Band3 also is acquired using a backward-looking telescope, thus providing along-track stereo coverage from which high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs) are generated as one of a suite of ASTER standard data products. ASTER DEM standard data products are produced with 30m postings, and have Z accuracies generally between 10 m and 25 m root mean square error (RMSE).The development project of the ASTER Ground Data System (ASTER GDS) began in fiscal year 1994. The ASTER Global DEM (GDEM) was released to the public on June 29, 2009.",
