    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The number of sensors that are deployed continues to increase for scientific, commercial and intelligence related applications. Quantities of sensor data are increasingly available. NASA and NOAA are generating large quantities of sensor data involving earth, oceans and weather observations. US intelligence and commercial endeavors are also generating vast amounts of sensor data, gathered from sources ranging from satellites to vehicles.\r\n\r\nStandards have been developed that assist in making the large volume of sensor data usable. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed a number of specifications related to Sensor Web Enablement. OGC working groups are not only science-focused; the newest working group that is forming is an Emergency and Disaster Management Discipline Working Group (DWG).\r\n\r\nIntelligent Automation Inc (IAI) is proposing to support the data access and utilization needs of the individual researcher / scientist and the emergency incident commander through development of the Sensor Management Tool (SMT). SMT is standards-based, open source and will offer configurable views for different categories of users.  In the Phase I effort IAI demonstrated feasibility and prototyped the SMT concept; this involved integration of NASA World Wind to extend SMT functionality.  'Lessons learned' provide input into our detailed plan for full-featured SMT development.",
