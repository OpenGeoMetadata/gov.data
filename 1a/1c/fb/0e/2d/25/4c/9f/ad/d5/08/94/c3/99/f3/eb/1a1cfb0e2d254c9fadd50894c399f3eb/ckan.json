  "notes": "This DVD-ROM contains copies of the navigation and field water gun subbottom data collected aboard the R/V Seaward Explorer, from 7-25 May, 1995. The coverage is in the New York Bight area. This DVD-ROM (Digital Versatile Disc-Read Only Memory) has been produced in accordance with the UDF (Universal Disc Format) DVD-ROM Standard (ISO 9660 equivalent) and is therefore capable of being read on any computing platform that has appropriate DVD-ROM driver software installed. Access to the data and information contained on this DVD-ROM was developed using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) utilized by the World Wide Web (WWW) project. Development of the DVD-ROM documentation and user interface in HTML allows a user to access the information by using a variety of WWW information browsers (i.e. NCSA Mosaic, Netscape) to facilitate browsing and locating information and data. To access the information contained on this disk with a WWW client browser, open the file'index.htm' at the top level directory of this DVD-ROM with your selected browser. The HTML documentation is written utilizing some HTML 4.0 enhancements. The disk should be viewable by all WWW browsers but may not properly format on some older WWW browsers. Also, some links to USGS collaborators and other agencies are available on this DVD-ROM. These links are only accessible if access to the Internet is available during browsing of the DVD-ROM. The archived water gun subbottom data are in standard Society of Exploration Geologists (SEG) SEG-Y format (Barry and others, 1975) and may be downloaded for processing with software such as Seismic Unix or SIOSEIS. DOS and Microsoft Windows compatible software for plotting SEG-Y files (PLOTSEIS) and viewing SEG-Y headers (DUMPSEGY) is located in the PLOTSEIS directory. Processed water gun profiles (GIF images) may be viewed on this DVD-ROM with your WWW browser. For more information on the seismic surveys see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1995-007-FA These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.",
