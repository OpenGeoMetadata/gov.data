Categories of CBSAs are: Metropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urbanized areas of 50,000 or more population; and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urban clusters of at least 10,000 population but less than 50,000 population.The CBSAs boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.",
