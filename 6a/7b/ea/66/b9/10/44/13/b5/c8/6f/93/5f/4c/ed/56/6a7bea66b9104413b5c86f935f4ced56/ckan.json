  "notes": " FUNCTION: Supports research in leading-edge progressive-scan imaging, high-definition television (HDTV), technology needed to process very high resolution images, and the impact on human perception with various presentation and image capture techniques. DESCRIPTION: The Motion Imagery Laboratory (MIL) is a research environment that leverages high-end computational assets, networks, and applications to take advantage of leading-edge capabilities in state-of-the-art motion imagery with progressive-scan HDTV. The MIL is working with imagery requirements in the near term where multiple 1.5-Gbps data streams are needed to handle the raw output, and is progressing to 100 Gbps and higher in the near future. The MIL is used to assess innovative techniques in next-generation video teleconferencing. Research is conducted on the issue of large single streams on multi-gigabit networks over very long distances in real time, and on the visual tools to support next-generation motion imagery capabilities. The MIL provides an environment to assess collaboration in intelligence, digital Earth model, test and evaluation, and other DoD needs where very high resolution imagery has an impact. The MIL supports work in compression technology, processing, transmission, and other technologies to allow access to high-resolution imagery by a full spectrum of users from average users at their desktops to those with the most demanding scientific and analytic needs. INSTRUMENTATION: The MIL includes projection facilities for very high definition immersion with surround screens, extremely high resolution micromirror projection, progressive-scan studio cameras, recording/replay capabilities, and other tools for comprehensive work in this area.
