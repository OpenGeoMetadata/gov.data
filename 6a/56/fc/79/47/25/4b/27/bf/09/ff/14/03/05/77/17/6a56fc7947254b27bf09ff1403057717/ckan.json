    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;A sustained human presence on the Moon,&amp;nbsp;Mars, or other celestial bodies, will require&amp;nbsp;numerous disciplines to create technologies,&amp;nbsp;solve current known problems, and anticipate&amp;nbsp;new ones. One problem identified during the&amp;nbsp;Apollo missions is plume ejecta: the expulsion of&amp;nbsp;dust, regolith, or other loose material from&amp;nbsp;the force of launch or landing.&amp;nbsp; Rocket plume effects on Mars will be&amp;nbsp;different from those on the Moon. Because Mars has an atmosphere, ejected particles will&amp;nbsp;not travel as far, meaning that infrastructure&amp;nbsp;could be placed at a safe distance from the&amp;nbsp;launch pad and not receive blast effects.&amp;nbsp;However, the presence of an atmosphere will&amp;nbsp;cause the rocket exhaust to collimate, which&amp;nbsp;will probably produce much deeper craters&amp;nbsp;than the Apollo missions produced on the&amp;nbsp;Moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plume ejecta was observed and&amp;nbsp;photographed during the recent landing of&amp;nbsp;the Mars rover, Curiosity. Even though the&amp;nbsp;sky crane landing system was designed to&amp;nbsp;minimize plume effects on the Mars surface,&amp;nbsp;areas of surface erosion were observed after&amp;nbsp;landing. Curiosity is the largest&amp;nbsp;vehicle that has landed on Mars. A human-sized&amp;nbsp;lander will be considerably larger, will&amp;nbsp;have more powerful rockets, and therefore,&amp;nbsp;will probably disturb the surface soil much&amp;nbsp;more. Deploying a landing pad or stabilizing&amp;nbsp;the soil can mitigate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to develop technology for building a landing pad through the following tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate microwave sintering under Mars like conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigate surface stabilization methods used for terrestrial applications and develop recommendations for a Mars landing pad based on these methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a plan for implementing a microwave sintering system on a mobile rover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was completed successfully, achieving the first ever sintering of a Mars simulant under Mars like conditions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, a design for a rover mounted sintering system was created.&amp;nbsp; Recommendations for initial soil measurements were developed based of off terrestrial experience.&lt;/p&gt;",
