  "notes": "This is a provisional dataset that contains point locations for all Environmental Justice (EJ) grants given out by the US EPA. There are many limitations to the data so it is advised that these metadata be read carefully before use. Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grants place of performance on a map. Instead, the IGMS grant recipients mailing address is the primary source for grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grants place of performance. In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants that were deemed community-based in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves. Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the Agencys grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving. The EJ Grants layer contains Places of Performance for single locations or areas where EJ grants are applied. This layer consists of grant data that is derived from an Environmental Justice grant program. This includes any grants that have a Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) code identifier of 66.604, signifying Environmental Justice Hazardous Substances Research Small Grants to Community Groups and Environmental Justice Small Grants Program for Community Research. It also contains any grant whose program code acronym is equivalent to EJ (Environmental Justice Community/University Partnership Grants Program), EQ (Environmental Justice Small Grant Program), TJ (State and Tribal Grants for Environmental Justice), PS (Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Grants Program), EP (Environmental Justice Assistance), or RJ (Environmental Justice Research Assistance). In addition to the above program code and CFDA code criteria, this data contains grants from the following grant programs: Environmental Justice Pollution Prevention Grants Program Surveys, Studies, Investigations, and Special Purpose Activities Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice Training and Fellowship Assistance Assistance to Nonprofit Organizations with Activities Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice Hazardous Substances Research Small Grants to Community Groups State Environmental Justice Cooperative Agreement Program",
