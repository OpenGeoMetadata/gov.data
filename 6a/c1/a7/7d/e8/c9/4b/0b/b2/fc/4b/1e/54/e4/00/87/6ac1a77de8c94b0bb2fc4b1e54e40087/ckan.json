    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The GPRSS technology is an in situ remediation technique for PCB-contaminated sediments. The technique provides an effective and safe method for sediment cleanup operations, eliminating some of the inherent risks associated with more traditional cleanup methods such as sediment dredging followed by incineration.&amp;nbsp; The GPRSS technique offers both removal and degradation of the contaminant, in contrast to the capping in place method, which retains significant long-term environmental reliability. The envisioned re-useable, polymer-based PCB treating blanket has the potential to be a global, cost saving, game-changing technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology utilizes a two-step process for the removal and degradation of the PCBs.&amp;nbsp; In the first step, a &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; of inert material (such as a simple polymer, i.e. polyethylene) is gently lowered into the water system and pushed into the top layer of the sediments, penetrating into the zone where benthic population is at the greatest risk for bioaccumulation.&amp;nbsp; This &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; acts as a PCB &amp;quot;sponge&amp;quot;, absorbing the PCBs that are bound to the sediments.&amp;nbsp; The second step consists of removing the &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot;, extracting the contaminants trapped within the blanket structure, and exposing the extracted PCBs to activated zero-valent magnesium in an acidified ethanol solvent to commence degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; has a solid upper surface, providing a temporary cap to the contaminated sediments during the treatment period.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the &amp;ldquo;blanket&amp;rdquo; is manufactured with extruding points, or &amp;quot;fingers&amp;quot;, that depress into the upper ten centimeters of the sediment layer, allowing for increased surface area contact with the deeper contaminated zone.&amp;nbsp; Both the &amp;quot;fingers&amp;quot; and the backing of the &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; are hollow to allow for the incorporation of ethanol into the interior.&amp;nbsp; This ethanol interior provides a major advantage to the GRPSSs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since PCBs are lipophilic and hydrophobic, they prefer to dissolve into the ethanol (or similar non-aqueous solvent) if given the opportunity.&amp;nbsp;This system affords that opportunity by generating a concentration gradient which enhances the rate of PCB transport from the sediment across the polymer blanket membrane and into the ethanol interior.&amp;nbsp; Once the PCBs are in the &amp;quot;blanket,&amp;quot; they entire system is removed from the sediment and the contaminants are extracted out of the blanket and degraded using stepwise reductive dechlorination in the presence of the magnesium reactant described above as step two.&amp;nbsp; The polymer &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; is capable of being re-used multiple times.&amp;nbsp; An entire riverbed for example would not be treated at a single event, but rather portions would be treated at a time. The reusability of the blankets allows them to be reapplied to different regions of the contaminated zone as remediation activities progress.&amp;nbsp; Should additional applications prove necessary to remediate high starting PCB concentrations to acceptable levels at a single site, such as a holding or sludge pond, the reuseability of the blanket adds to its cost competitive nature, or to simply treat another contaminated sediment zone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
