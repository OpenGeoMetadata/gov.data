  "notes": "Assessing the physical change to shorelines and wetlands is critical in determining the resiliency of wetland systems that protect adjacent habitat and communities. The wetland and back-barrier shorelines of Assateague Island, located in Maryland and Virginia, changed as a result of wave action and storm surge that occurred during Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall on October 29, 2012. The impact of Hurricane Sandy will be assessed and placed in its historical context to understand the future vulnerability of wetland systems. Making these assessments will rely on data extracted from current and historical resources such as maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and lidar elevation data, which document physical changes over time. This USGS Data Series publication includes several open-ocean shorelines, back-island shorelines, back-island shoreline points, sand area polygons, and sand lines for Assateague Island that were extracted from orthoimagery (orthoaerial photography) dated from April 12, 1989 to September 5, 2013. This dataset consists of points that were digitized at the intersection of the back-island shoreline and a set of transects spaced at 20 meter (m) intervals. The transects, asis_transects_ln_20m_utm18.shp, are included in this Data Series publication and can be accessed via the Data Download page. Only one back-island shoreline/transect intersection point was digitized per transect. Orthoimagery of Assateague Island were acquired in digital format from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Virginia Geographic Information Network (VGIN) courtesy of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The following list provides additional details about the orthoimagery used. The back-island shoreline points for all dates have been compiled into one dataset (shapefile) named asis_bshrln_1989_2013_transect_guided.shp. The orthoimage date for each line is included in the shapefile attribute table Date_ field.
