    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In Phase I, NP Photonics has achieved 1.2 kW peak power for 105 ns fiber laser pulses, and successfully demonstrated the feasibility to produce monolithic high SBS threshold narrow linewidth fiber amplifiers for all fiber-based laser transmitters ideally suited to NASA's active remote sensing spectroscopy. In Phase II, NP Photonics proposes to develop prototypes or products of the high SBS-threshold, Single-Mode (SM), polarization maintaining (PM), high power amplifiers operating with sub-microsecond pulses and transform-limited linewidth. This is based on the successful demonstrations in Phase I by using NP's proprietary patented large core SM PM highly Er/Yb co-doped phosphate glass fibers. Furthermore, in order to push the SBS threshold to the 100s kW level and to demonstrate even higher SBS threshold and improved conversion efficiency for 100-500 ns transform-limited fiber laser pulses, a new large core SM PM photonic crystal phosphate fiber 100/400 will be designed and fabricated in Phase II. It will be used to build the 3rd power amplifier stage in order to offer prototype/product services by achieving 10s kW peak power and 5-mJ pulse energy free of SBS effects. This will more fully enable NASA's active remote sensing with fiber laser pulses at 765 nm by using NP's Single Mode phosphate fiber amplifiers.",
