    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS), in partnership with MOLLC will focus the proposed NASA Phase 2 effort on the development and demonstration of our innovative Multi-A.U. SOLAROSA technology.  SOLAROSA, named for Stretched Optical Lens Architecture on Roll-Out Solar Array, is a new lightweight, high-performance space solar array that enables missions through low-cost, lightweight, compact stowage volume, radiation hardness, high voltage capability, scalability to ultra-high power, and LILT/HIHT environment operability.  SOLAROSA is a fusion of the proven Stretched Lens Array (SLA) concentrator technology with DSS's innovative ultra-lightweight Roll-Out Solar Array deployable structural platform.  The proposed Phase 2 program is specifically focused on technology development and demonstration of multi-A.U. operability, large beta axis off-pointing operational capability, and high radiation environmental survivability.  The proposed Phase 2 program provides NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk solar array that provides revolutionary performance in terms of high specific power, affordability, lightweight, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume, reliability, high radiation tolerance, high voltage operation capability, scalability, and LILT/HIHT operation capability.  The predicted performance metrics for the SOLAROSA technology are incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art, and in many cases are mission-enabling for future NASA Space Science and Exploration missions, and particularly for NASA deep space solar electric propulsion (SEP) high-voltage and high radiation missions.",
