    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Switching from metallic to composite construction holds the&amp;nbsp;potential to dramatically increase the performance capabilities of&amp;nbsp;future space systems through a dramatic reduction in weight. A&amp;nbsp;potential initial target application for the composite technology is&amp;nbsp;an upgrade to the upper stage of NASA&amp;#39;s Space Launch System&amp;nbsp;heavy-lift rocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4-meter diameter Tank Test Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built by Boeing at their Tukwila, Wash., facility, the tank arrived&amp;nbsp;at NASA in late 2012. On June 25, 2013 at NASA MSFC, the 2.4m diameter all-composite cryogenic tank was successfully pressure tested. The test met all requirements: stepwise fill with liq&amp;shy;uid hydrogen (&amp;ndash;423 &amp;deg;F) to 90&#37; volume capacity followed by pressurizing the tank to 135 psig. The 2.4m tank was then cycled through 20 pressure/vent cycles, measuring hydrogen gas permeation on the tank dome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.5m Tank Test Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s Super Guppy, a wide-bodied cargo aircraft, landed at the Redstone Army Airfield near Huntsville, Ala. on March 26, 2014 and since then NASA has completed a demand&amp;shy;ing series of tests inside the test stand at MSFC. Engineers added structural loads to the tank to replicate the physical stresses launch vehicles experience during flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other tests, the tank successfully maintained fuels at extremely low temperatures and operated at various pres&amp;shy;sures. Engineers filled the tank with almost 30,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen chilled to &amp;ndash;423 &amp;deg;F, and repeatedly cycled the pressure between 20 to 53 pounds per square inch &amp;ndash; the pressure limit set for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These successful tests marked an important milestone on the&amp;nbsp;path to demonstrating the composite cryogenic tanks needed to&amp;nbsp;accomplish the next generation of deep space missions. This&amp;nbsp;investment in game changing space technology will help enable&amp;nbsp;NASA&amp;#39;s exploration of deep space while directly benefiting&amp;nbsp;American industrial capability in the manufacturing and use of&amp;nbsp;composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2011, NASA awarded Boeing the contract to design, manufacture and test two lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCTD was an agency-wide effort with Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) leading project management, manufacturing &amp;amp; test, Glenn Research Center (GRC) leading the materials, and Langley Research Center (LaRC) leading structures effort for this project. Significant contributions from LaRC &amp;amp; GRC loads/stress personnel contributed to the understanding of thermal/ mechanical strain response while undergoing testing at cryogenic temperatures. The project finalized in September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composite tank project provided a great deal of expe&amp;shy;rience and improved confidence in utilizing composites and therefore is changing the way we look at composites for spacecraft applications.&lt;/p&gt;",
