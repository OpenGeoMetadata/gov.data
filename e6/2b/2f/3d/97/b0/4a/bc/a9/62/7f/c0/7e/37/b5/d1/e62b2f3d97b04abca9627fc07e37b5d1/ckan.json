  "notes": "The 289-acre Buena Vista Property consists of three parcels; one consisting of approximately 187 acres, one consisting of approximately 100 acres, and another consisting of approximately 2 acres, currently owned by California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). However, CDFG has indicated that they have limited resources to manage Buena Vista. Therefore, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to accept donation of the 100-acre and 2-acre parcels from CDFG in fee title and to cooperatively manage the entire 289-acre property as a unit of the Ellicott Slough National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and State Ecological Reserve (See Figure 1). CDFG would retain ownership of the 187-acre parcel and would enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Service for management of the Buena Vista property. This is similar to the current management arrangement at the Refuge where the Service manages the entire area, including a 30-acre parcel owned by CDFG.  This Conceptual Management Plan (CMP) is for the Service's proposed acquisition and management of the Buena Vista Unit of the Refuge and presents a general outline on how Buena Vista would be managed. As a conceptual plan, this CMP does not provide extensive detail or pinpoint exactly where long-term habitat improvements could be made or exactly where public use facilities would be ultimately constructed. Those details would be included in the Refuge's Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP), a long-term formal planning effort scheduled to begin in 2005 for the Refuge. During the CCP planning effort, goals, objectives, and strategies for public use as well as resource management will be developed, with input from the public and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. This CMP, however, presents a broad overview of the Service's proposed management approaches to wildlife, habitats, public uses,  wildlife-dependent recreational activities, wildfire suppression, rights-of-way, easements, law enforcement, and facilities. More specific information is included for activities proposed during the interim period, prior to implementation of an approved CCP.  As part of the acquisition process, an Environmental Assessment, Land Protection Plan, compatibility determinations, and a Section 7 endangered species consultation, have been prepared by the Service to analyze the environmental effects of establishing and managing the proposed Buena Vista Unit of the Refuge. The purpose of the proposed Buena Vista addition is to enhance survival prospects of endangered species in the area. This expansion is being proposed primarily to protect the endangered Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum).  The Buena Vista property is extremely important to the survival of the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (SCLTS) because of the small number of active breeding populations (11 known), and the limited amount of suitable habitat. In addition, acquisition and management of this site would benefit other rare species including the endangered robust spineflower (Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta) and the threatened California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense). Buena Vista supports one of only six known populations of the robust spineflower, and 135 acres  of the property are included in the designated critical habitat (50 CFR 17 36822-36845). Other rare plants on the site include Hooker's manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri) (CNPS 1B), Kellogg's horkelia (Horkelia cuneata ssp. sericea) (CNPS 1B), and California bottlebrush grass (Elymus californicus) (CNPS 4).",
