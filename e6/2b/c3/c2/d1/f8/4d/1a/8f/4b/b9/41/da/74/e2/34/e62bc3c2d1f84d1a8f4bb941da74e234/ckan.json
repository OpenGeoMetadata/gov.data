    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Because conventional Radiation Hardness assurance is predicated on having data specific to the part (and possibly on the particular wafer diffusion lot of that part)&amp;nbsp;being considered for flight, it has been difficult to adapt to cubesat, Class-D and other risk-tolerant mission platforms.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, even for missions with low risk tolerance, it has&amp;nbsp;not been possible to place quantitative bounds on risk arising from radiation threats prior to obtaining part-specific data relevant for the application.&amp;nbsp; Often, the best that could be done would be to look at less specific data to seek qualitative reassurance that parts would ultimately fulfill their requirements.&amp;nbsp; Such data include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical Data--radiation test data for the same part type, but different lots tested in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarity or Process Data--Radiation test data for similar parts fabricated in the same semiconductor process as the flight parts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heritage data--data regarding the past successful use of the flight parts in previous similar missions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these data types poses challenges, and to date, use of these types of data has been qualitative.&amp;nbsp; We propose use of Bayesian probability to use these data types to develop quantitative radiation risk metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For short, risk-tolerant missions, often the most significant risks arise from single-event effects, which due to their Poisson nature can occur at any time during the mission.&amp;nbsp; Because single-event effects susceptibility is usually considered negligible from one&amp;nbsp;wafer diffusion lot to another and from part to part within a wafer diffusion lot, we concentrate on use of similarity data and heritage data.&amp;nbsp; The method addresses ways to limit the influence of the initial prior probability distribution so that the resulting distributions and discusses ways to develop statistics that are relevant to the SEE risks being considered, but still form compact distributions in the analysis.&amp;nbsp; The attached paper and presentation give details and the general philosophy of the method.&lt;/p&gt;",
