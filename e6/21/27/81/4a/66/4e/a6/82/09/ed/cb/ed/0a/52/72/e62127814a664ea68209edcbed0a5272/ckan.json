  "notes": "The Arkansas Secretary of State contracted the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, GIS Applications Laboratory (UALRGIS) to use modern geographic information technology and improved base maps to create a current and spatially accurate statewide depiction of school district boundaries in the State of Arkansas. The Arkansas Geographic Information Office merged annexed and consolidated districts. UALRGIS followed a work plan for the project that was established by the Arkansas Geographic Information Office (AGIO) for the Secretary of State. The school district boundary editing rules were as follows: 1. Legal descriptions take precedent. 2. If no legal description was provided the visual evidence presented on the digital ortho quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) was followed. 3. Section lines, county boundaries, city boundaries and / or roads have only be used as supporting visual evidence viewed on the DOQQ.",
