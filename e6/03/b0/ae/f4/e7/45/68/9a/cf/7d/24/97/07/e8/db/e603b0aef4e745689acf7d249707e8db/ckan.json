  "notes": " FUNCTION: The Electra Laser Facility is used to develop the science and technology needed to develop a reliable, efficient, high-energy, repetitively pulsed krypton fluoride (KrF) laser. The main application for this laser is a driver for a fusion energy power plant. However, the laser architecture also has defense applications. DESCRIPTION: Electra is an electron-beam-pumped laser. It produces 200- to 700-J, 140-nsec-long laser pulses at rep rates from 1 to 5 Hz. It has run at 2.5 Hz for 16,000 shots (approximately 2 hours). The main amplifier is pumped with two 500,000-V, 100,000-A electron beams. Each beam is 30 cm high by 100 cm long. The pre-amplifier is pumped with two 175,000-V, 80,000-A, 40-nsec-long electron beams. In both cases, the electron beams excite a krypton-fluorine gas mixture inside a laser cell. A thin foil, supported by a structure known as a hibachi, isolates the vacuum regions in which the electron beams are formed, from the gas inside the laser cell. A recirculator both cools and quiets the laser gas between shots. This type of laser is predicted to have total efficiencies of greater than 7%. This is due to advances in the electron beam physics, laser physics, and hibachi. A new solid-state pulsed power switch has been developed that can become the basis for a durable, efficient, and cost-effective pulsed power system. INSTRUMENTATION: The operation of the Electra facility is carried out through a computerized control system that continually monitors all system parameters. This includes the input, inter-stage, and output voltages, magnetic current, trigger laser operation, and gas, electrolyte, and coolant temperature and flow. A totally separate system is used to acquire data from the experiment, including electron beam voltage and current, laser gas parameters, laser output, and laser pulse shape.  ",
