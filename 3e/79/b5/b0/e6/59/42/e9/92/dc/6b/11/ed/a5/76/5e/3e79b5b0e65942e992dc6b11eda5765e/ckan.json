  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides airborne research platforms to conduct and support worldwide scientific research projects. Operates and maintains a fleet of five uniquely onfigured, research modified aircraft. DESCRIPTION: Scientific Development Squadron ONE is the Navy&amp;#39;s and DoD&amp;#39;s only squadron dedicated to science and technology research. Located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, the squadron owns and operates three NP-3D Orion aircraft and two RC-12 King Air aircraft configured to perform numerous airborne research projects, including bathymetry, electronic countermeasures, geophysical mapping, and radar development research. Of the three NP-3Ds, VXS-1 flies the Navy&amp;#39;s only Rotodome modified P-3 aircraft. The command is the Aircraft Reporting Custodian of four SCAN Eagle Unmanned Aircraft Systems. These platforms primarily support an Office of Naval Research project operated by NAVSEA, but also provide small payload capability to the Naval Research Laboratory through VXS-1.In addition to aircraft, squadron facilities include 15,300 sq. ftof admimnistrative andwork space, a 40,240 sq. fthangar deck, a 5,240 sq. ftstorage facility, and two researchprojects buildings. The Naval Air Station provides three runways and a large number of aircraft support services. The VXS-1 Commanding Officer is responsible for setting policy, scheduling aircraft assets, managing the daily activities of the squadron, and ensuring the safe and successful execution of worldwide deployed scientific research projects tasked by the Naval Research Laboratory.
