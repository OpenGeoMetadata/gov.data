    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The environmental impact of aviation is enormous given the fact that\r\nin the US alone there are nearly 6 million flights per year of commercial aircraft.\r\nThis situation has driven numerous policy and procedural measures to help develop\r\nenvironmentally friendly technologies which are safe and affordable and reduce the\r\nenvironmental impact of aviation. However, many of these technologies require significant\r\ninitial investment in newer aircraft fleets and modifications to existing regulations\r\nwhich are both long and costly enterprises. We propose to use an anomaly\r\ndetection method based on Virtual Sensors to help detect overconsumption of fuel in\r\naircraft which relies only on the data recorded during flight of most existing commercial\r\naircraft, thus significantly reducing the cost and complexity of implementing this\r\nmethod. The Virtual Sensors developed here are ensemble-learning regression models\r\nfor detecting the overconsumption of fuel based on instantaneous measurements\r\nof the aircraft state. This approach requires no additional information about standard\r\noperating procedures or other encoded domain knowledge. We present experimental\r\nresults on three data sets and compare five different Virtual Sensors algorithms. The\r\nfirst two data sets are publicly available and consist of a simulated data set from a\r\nflight simulator and a real-world turbine disk.We show the ability to detect anomalies\r\nwith high accuracy on these data sets. These sets contain seeded faults, meaning that\r\nthey have been deliberately injected into the system. The second data set is from realworld\r\nfleet of 84 jet aircraft where we show the ability to detect fuel overconsumption\r\nwhich can have a significant environmental and economic impact. To the best of our\r\nknowledge, this is the first study of its kind in the aviation domain.",
