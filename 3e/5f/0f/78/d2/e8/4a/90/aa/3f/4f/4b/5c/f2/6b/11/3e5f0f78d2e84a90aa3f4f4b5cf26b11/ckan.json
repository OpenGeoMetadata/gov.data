  "notes": "Efficient water management of the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge, located in the Rattlesnake Creek Basin of south-central Kansas, is a complicated task. In a cooperative study with the Kansas Geological Survey, the U.S. Geological Survey developed a computer-based water-budget and flow-routing model to assist the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in determining the outcome of possible water-management options. The computer model uses network analysis to determine the optimal operation of canals and control ponds on the refuge. Applications of the model are presented that investigate the daily operation of canals and control ponds on the refuge using historical discharges and pond water levels.  Simulation of the daily operation of the canal and control-pond system at the refuge from June 11 through December 11, 1996, was conducted using the computer model. Simulated pond water levels matched well with measured ones. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated and measured water levels in ponds was less than 0.13 foot except for two ponds. Water storage in ponds during the simulation period was substantially reduced due to water-surface evaporation and canal-flow transmission losses. Simulation of canal and control-pond operation was also conducted with different target pond water levels. This simulation used 1991 discharge, precipitation, and water-surface evaporation data to consider model results during drought conditions. Results indicated that lowering target pond water levels reduced water-surface evaporation, resulted in more water stored in ponds at the north end of the refuge, and caused a substantial decrease in the final volume of water stored in the main water-storage unit at the south end of the refuge (Little Salt Marsh).",
