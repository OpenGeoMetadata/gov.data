    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A constant demand exists to improve the sensitivity of trace chemical\nspecies measurement systems, which is often limited by the performance\nof the infrared photon detector components. The significant cooling\nrequired to reduce dark currents and increase detectivities is a\npractical concern associated with these infrared detectors. For\ngeostationary and low-Earth orbital platforms, passive cooling systems\nhave been developed to provide a suitable means of incorporating such\nhigh-performance infrared detectors. The passive cooling system for the\nCrosstrack Infrared Sounder has provided a means to achieve a set point\nof 81 K for long-wavelength infrared detector operation. We will develop\nin this proposed effort the technology for high-performance,\npassively-cooled infrared (6-14 microns spectral range) detectors with\nintegrated capabilites for Fabry-Perot spectroscopy. The proposed\nsensors will be based on HgCdTe  material for high detectivities and use\nan Auger-suppression technique to reduce cooling requirements. HgCdTe\ndetectors capable of operating under passive cooling conditions will be\ndesigned, fabricated and tested. In parallel, Fabry-Perot cavities\nsuitable for future integration with the HgCdTe infrared detectors will\nbe designed, fabricated and tested. The infrared detector arrays and\ntunable Fabry Perot cavities will be integrated in later phases of the\nproposed project.",
