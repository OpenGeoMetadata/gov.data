  "notes": "Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) eyries in the State of New Jersey averaged 1.38 fledglings per active nest from 1979 to 1988. The Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge's (NWR) Barnegat eyrie failed to produce a single fledgling during this period, despite consistent nesting attempts. Poor reproductive performance at the Barnegat eyrie prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife to investigate potential interaction between contaminants and peregrine falcon reproductive performance. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that TCDD equivalent concentrations (TEQs) of planar PCB congeners, PCDDs, and PCDFs are higher in eggs from eyries exhibiting low productivity. In addition, other organochlorines and inorganic contaminants were examined as potential contributors to reproductive risks. Non-viable eggs from the Edwin B. Forsythe NWR and seven other New Jersey eyries were analyzed for planar PCB congeners, PCDDs, PCDFs, inorganics, and organochlorine pesticides. Reproductive data were summarized to evaluate the relationship between the levels of contaminants in peregrine falcon eggs and productivity. Non-ortho PCBs (specifically PCB 77 and PCB 126) were present at elevated levels in Atlantic coast eggs relative to those of the Delaware River. Based on TEQs, non-ortho PCBs (PCB 77 and PCB 126) were the most likely contributors to observed hatching failure on the Atlantic coast. Based on a raptor-specific reference toxicity value, levels of PCB 126 alone were sufficient to impact hatching success in all Atlantic coast nests, but not Delaware River nests. Total TEQ concentrations on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey were among the highest ever documented in eggs of this species (318 to 757 pg/g fresh weight). These findings contrast with those of the Delaware River eyries where total TEQ concentrations (90 to 175 pg/g) were generally below levels of concern. It is evident that the congener profiles in the Atlantic coast eggs were substantially different from those of the Delaware River. Concentrations of mercury and DDE were also detected in some eggs at levels which may adversely affect peregrine falcon reproductive success. The mean mercury concentration at Atlantic coast eyries (0.38 ug/g fresh weight) was more than 30 times greater than that at Delaware River eyries (0.012 ug/g). The DDE concentration at some eyries indicated that DDE may continue to be a reproductive hazard for some of these birds (maximum of 24.2 ug/g at the Tuckahoe nest). While detected concentrations of PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, DDE, and mercury in many eggs were theoretically sufficient to impact peregrine falcon reproduction, the productivity and eggshell thinning data do not support a conclusion of reproductive impairment in New Jersey peregrine falcons due to contaminants. Multiple regression analysis revealed no correlation between concentrations of DDE, PCB 77, PCB 126, total PCBs, and total TEQs in eggs and eggshell thickness data from the same eggs. If contaminants are impacting reproduction, the effect is minor when compared to influences such as nest locations (bridge vs. tower), disturbance, predation, etc., and would probably be undetectable at the sample sizes involved in this study. Further congener-specific organochlorine and inorganic monitoring of peregrines, their prey and supporting food chain is recommended to identify exposure pathways and elucidate reasons for the large differences in exposure between Atlantic coast and Delaware River eyries.",
