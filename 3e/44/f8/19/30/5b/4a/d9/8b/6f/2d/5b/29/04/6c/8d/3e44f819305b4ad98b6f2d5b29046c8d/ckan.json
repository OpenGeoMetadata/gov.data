    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to apply to planetary terrain mapping an alternative, multiresolution method, subdivision surfaces (subdivs), in place of conventional digital elevation maps (DEMs) and fixed-resolution meshes. The proposed research is innovative in that it presents a new setting for subdivs that demands novel extensions to subdivision algorithms, techniques and theory. The primary objectives of this work are to: (1) demonstrate suitability of subdivs as a representation for terrain data with highly varied spatial resolution and 3-D features; (2) demonstrate their ability to encode, and later re-register, local detail non-destructively through hierarchical edits; and (3) prototype a software user interface introducing new capabilities enabled by the subdiv representation. The expected benefits are: (a) higher-fidelity terrain visualization with reduced infrastructure requirements; (b) ability to visualize 3-D features, such as overhangs, missed in DEM's; (c) compact encoding with natural level-of-detail control for interactive viewing even on mobile devices; (d) greater algorithmic efficiency for non-visualization scientific computation; and (e) enablement of new software-tool capabilities for dynamic mapping of alternative local-terrain datasets, non-destructive experimentation, collaboration, and data traceability. The innovation also promises capability and reliability benefits to a surface robot by unifying terrain representations and enabling minimal upload of only incremental terrain details from the ground.",
