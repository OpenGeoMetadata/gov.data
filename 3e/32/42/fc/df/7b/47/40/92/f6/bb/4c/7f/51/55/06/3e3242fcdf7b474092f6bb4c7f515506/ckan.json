    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A number of future space sciences missions require optical surfaces that\nare accurate to nanometer and sub-nanometer levels.  These applications\ninclude large aperture systems such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder\n(TPF) chronograph, where mid-spatial frequency surface error content is\nrestricted to 2 nm RMS, and EUV wavelength applications, like SHARPI,\nwhere full aperture surface errors need to be reduced to the single\nnanometer level.  In most cases these optical systems require components\nwhich are generalized aspheres, with no simple point tests.  Computer\nGenerated Holographic (CGH) null optics are typically applied to test\nthese optical surfaces.  As the quality requirements placed upon these\noptics gets tighter, the precision associated with CGH manufacturing\nneeds to improve as well.  CGH's are produced using laser or e-beam\nbased pattern generation tools which were originally developed for\nphotomask generation in the lithography industry.  Tinsley Laboratories\nproposes to develop CGH improvements in the area of substrate\npreparation and pattern placement errors.  Tinsley, an industry leader\nin the application of CGH testing approaches, will work closely with\nDiffraction International, Inc. the industry leader in the area of CGH\nmanufacturing.  Tinsley's experience with the application of CGH tools,\nand our state-of-the-art Computer Controlled Optical Surfacing (CCOS)\nmanufacturing processes, make us well suited to address issues related\nto implementation and substrate preparation.  Diffraction International\nwill provide support with regard to techniques which can provide\nimprovements in the pattern placement area, and the evaluation of\nalternative manufacturing platforms that might be utilized to provide\nhigher quality diffractive nulls.  Our overall goal is to provide a 10x\nreduction in the residual error associated with current\nstate-of-the-technology CGH null optics.",
