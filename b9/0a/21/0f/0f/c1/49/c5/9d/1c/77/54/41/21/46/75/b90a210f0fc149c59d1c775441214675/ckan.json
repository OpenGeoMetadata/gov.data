  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides an ultra-highvacuum facility for the development and calibration of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray optics and instrumentation using monochromatic synchrotron radiation. Optical components such as mirrors, diffraction gratings, filters, and sensors, as well as complete spaceflight and laboratory instruments, are calibrated. DESCRIPTION: The facility has been used to calibrate EUV and X-ray optical components and complete instruments for spaceflight and laboratory applications. The spaceflight components include multilayer-coated diffraction gratings and mirrors for NASA missions. Instrument calibrations include the EUV spectrometers for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) spacecraft. Gratings, mirrors, filters, and sensors have been calibrated for laboratory studies of the EUV and X-ray emissions from laser-produced plasmas at NRL and DOE laser facilities. INSTRUMENTATION: The facility consists of a calibration chamber that is attached to the NRL beamline X24C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. The chamber&amp;#39;s inside dimensions are 63 in. long x 24 in. diameter. It has various computer-controlled translational and rotational mechanisms for the remote manipulation of the test components and detectors. Turbomolecular and ion pumps provide ultra-high-vacuum conditions. The vacuum cleanliness, important for preserving the functionality of EUV and X-ray optical components, is monitored by a thermoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (TQCM) and residual gas analyzer (RGA). Monochromatic radiation, with wavelengths of 1 nm through the ultraviolet and visible regions, is provided by the X24C beamline monochromator that is located approximately 15 m from the calibration chamber. The radiation beam is several mm in diameter, has low divergence, and has spectral resolution of approximately 400. The beam is polarized with the electric vector in the horizontal plane, and this permits the measurement of the polarization response properties of the EUV and X-ray optics. Absolutely calibrated silicon photodiode detectors measure the incident beam intensity and the beam reflected, diffracted, or transmitted by the optical components. A 2-in.-square Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor provides high-resolution images of the beam. Monochromator wavelength scans and data collection are computer controlled.  ",
