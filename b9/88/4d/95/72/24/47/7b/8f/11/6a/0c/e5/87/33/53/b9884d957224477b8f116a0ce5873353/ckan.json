  "notes": "This data set represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP312), Agricultural Waste Management Systems on agricultural land by county. \"An agricultural waste management system (AWMS) is a planned system in which all necessary components are installed and managed to control and use byproducts of agricultural production in a manner that sustains or enhances the quality of air, water, soil, plant, and animal resources. Agricultural waste management systems must be developed using the total systems approach. A total system accounts for all the waste associated with an agricultural enterprise throughout the year from production to utilization. In short, it is the management of all the waste, all the time, all the way.\" (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) This data set was created with geographic information systems (GIS) and database management tools. The acres on which AWMS's are applied were totaled at the county level in the tabular NRI database and then apportioned to a raster coverage of agricultural land within the county based on the Enhanced National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) 1-kilometer resolution land cover grids (Nakagaki, 2003). Federal land is not considered in this analysis because NRI does not record information on those lands.",
