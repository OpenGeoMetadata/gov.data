  "notes": "MGC100 is a statewide data set that consists of approximately 400 raster-formatted data layers. It is available on a single CD-ROM in either EPPL7, or ERDAS and GeoTIFF formats. The data themes cover a wide range of physical and biological variables along with administrative, political, sociodemographic, and transportation data. The data collection unit for most of the variables is the 40-acre parcel. Files have been subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this processing step does not improve the original 40-acre resolution accuracy. The data set is designed for use in regional and statewide planning, not for site-specific decision making. MGC100 is effectively the MLMIS100 county data set appended into a statewide coverage. There is also some 30-meter data for the Twin Cities metropolitan area on this CD.",
