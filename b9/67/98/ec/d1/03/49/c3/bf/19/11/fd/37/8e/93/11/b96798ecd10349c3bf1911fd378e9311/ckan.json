  "notes": " Armstrong&amp;#39;s Consolidated Information Technology Center replaced antiquated facilities and consolidated all IT services at one facility. It provides a secure environment and enable us to do more. In addition, the costs of this building over its life cycle will be much lower. Designed by the Development One Inc., architectural firm of Santa Ana, Calif., the new building is a state-of-the-art facility to meet both current and anticipated future information technology requirements. The building provides energy conservation, recycling, and water efficiency. Armstrong&amp;#39;s facility is a silver building, a second of four tiers used to describe new Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED Buildings, as designated by the U.S. Green Building council.   It also marks the first &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; building to be constructed at Armstrong. The new building consists of steel-frame, concrete masonry construction, with aluminum and glass wall elements and perforated metal overhangs. The new facility is in line with agency-wide goals to consolidate IT resources and building more environmentally sound buildings.   The facility is expected to improve the overall reliability of IT service delivery to Armstrong customers. It was designed as a Tier III building, which means there is redundant power and cooling for everything, so any one component failure doesn&amp;#39;t impact IT service delivery. This facility has doubled the office space for the IT staff and and has allowed the whole organization to be consolidated into one building.   The new information technology center is a model for NASA data centers of the future. The project facilitates reliable, secure and rapid analysis of critical flight research data to prepare Armstrong for future research mission data requirements.  ",
