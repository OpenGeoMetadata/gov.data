    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA, DoD, and commercial aircraft operators need to transform vast amounts of aircraft data accumulated in distributed databases into actionable knowledge. We propose distributed algorithms for data-driven health monitoring on aircraft, aircraft fleet, and national airspace levels. The proposed algorithms are based on distributed optimization formulation, and, unlike existing distributed processing methods, have rigorous guarantees of producing the same results as centralized processing would do. Our algorithms will be implemented in an open scalable framework that allows integrating distributed data and federated third party algorithms for anomaly detection, diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis.   We will apply the proposed approach to aircraft performance monitoring from FOQA data. We will train regression models of aircraft performance using distributed agents associated with different data sets, locations, and organizations.  The trained models will be then used for anomaly detection, diagnosis (fault isolation), prognosis (forecasting), and mitigation (decision support).  This project will develop web-based distributed open architecture software implementing the proposed optimization-based approaches and demonstrate scalability to at least 10 TB of data. Besides the developed algorithms, we will explore integration of third party algorithms into the distributed environment. The developed technologies will be applicable to a broad range of aircraft-related and other problems. ",
