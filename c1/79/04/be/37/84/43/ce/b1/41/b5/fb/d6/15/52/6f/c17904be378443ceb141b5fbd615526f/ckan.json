The Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school\n               districts from State officials for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with estimates of the number of children in poverty\n               within each school district. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding\n               to States and school districts. TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary and unified school districts. The school\n               district boundaries are those in effect for the 2013-2014 school year. ",
