  "notes": "This data set contains point locations of geothermally active areas as compiled by Motyka et al., 1993. Because of the variety of geothermal activity present at any given site, each site has been mapped according to the dominant style of geothermal activity (i.e. water dominated sites, vapor dominated sites, or sites of known subsurface activity). It is important to note that at any given site, a combination of vapor, water, and subtle indicators of subsurface geothermal activity is most likely present.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West Coastal Resource Service Area (CRSA). These data identify the marine and coastal environments and wildlife. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
