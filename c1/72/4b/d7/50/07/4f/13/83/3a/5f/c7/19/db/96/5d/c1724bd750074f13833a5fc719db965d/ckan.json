  "notes": " The mission of Midwest HSRC is to support collaborative research and technology transfer efforts within EPA regions 3,5, and 7 with a focus on integrated low cost remediation technologies that improve risk management by removing contaminants from the environment and restoring ecosystem quality, thereby enhancing site redevelopment options. This mission will be accomplished through an extensive university/EPA/industry partnership involving a multidisciplinary research program. The Midwest HSRC partnership arrangements are well developed, with many industrial-matching commitments. Comprehensive technology transfer and outreach programs will integrate new knowledge and technology into use by industry, communities, and government. The Midwest HSRC also has a strong commitment to diversity issues and will provide opportunities for minority students and faculty from three minority institutions to become involved in Midwest HSRC research, outreach, and technology transfer programs.
