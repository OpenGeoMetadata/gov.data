  "notes": "\nMaps are a critical cornerstone of coral reef management, research and planning, with direct links to management needs in a number of forms.  To accurately characterize benthic habitats of coral reef ecosystems, several basic types of data must be collected (bathymetry, backscatter, imagery, underwater optical validation) and a variety of techniques are available to provide each data type.\n\nIn 2016 the following mapping related projects will take place:\n\nMapping Habitat Change in Saipan Lagoon, CNMI: This one-year project will create a benthic map for Saipan Lagoon (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI). Habitats were last characterized there based on 2004 data (Houk and van Woesik, 2008) and have likely changed due to coral loss and the recent passage of typhoons (e.g. Soudelor, Aug 2015). Consequently, resource managers requested an updated map, so they can assess habitat changes over the last decade. This map will be used to inform monitoring and management decisions, and will be incorporated into the Saipan Lagoon Use Management Plan.\n\nMapping Essential Fish Habitat in the US Caribbean to inform MPA management: The purpose of this project is to fill critical informational gaps that will support improved management measures in USVI and Puerto Rico high priority sites identified by Jurisdictional managers. This project will utilize NOAA ship-based efforts to identify the distribution, health, extent and type of coral reefs ecosystems and the abundance of reef fishes in coastal waters(approximately 10-150 m water depth). Our efforts will focus on two sites: shelf edge within the Virgin Passage between Culebra and St Thomas; and southeast coast of Puerto Rico along the shelf edge proximal to Guanica, Puerto Rico.\n\nDeveloping A Benthic Habitat Map for the South Eastern Puerto Rican Shelf: The purpose of this proposed three-year project is to develop a benthic habitat map for uncharacterized areas between 30-100 m in depth on the South Eastern Puerto Rican Shelf. The proposed 2nd year (FY16) will focus on developing a draft habitat map from this reprocessed imagery. The proposed 3rd year (FY17) will finalize this map, and develop a report and GIS products for dissemination. This new habitat map will provide baseline information to help guide the monitoring and management of important coral reef habitats, fisheries species spawning aggregation sites and MPAs in the USVI and broader jurisdiction.\n\nMapping and EcoSpatial Information Products to Support Coral Reef Ecosystem Management in the Pacific Islands Region: The purpose of the Mapping and EcoSpatial Information Products project is to provide accurate and complete bathymetry, geomorphology, benthic characterization and other spatial ecological and socio-economic data for all jurisdictions across the Pacific Islands Region. The project will use these data layers to derive higher-order analytical information products to support efforts to address specific coral reef threats and management needs, including critical habitat designation information for ESA-listed corals, reef fish stock assessments, climate change vulnerability assessments, land-based sources of pollution impacts, and broader ecosystem-based management decision making and policy implementation to conserve coral reef ecosystems and their associated services.",
