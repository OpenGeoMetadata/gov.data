    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission\ndesigned to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide\nwith the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the\nprocesses controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses\nthe LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates\nthree high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of\nreflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 μm and in\nmolecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 μm\n\nThe three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated\nindependently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to\nthe Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral\nelements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.\n\nThis L1B product results from calibration mode measurements (e.g., Lunar,\nSolar, Dark observations), and thus it differs from the OCO2_L1B_Science\n(L1bSc) product. The differences in the product formats are only in the\ngeolocation information provided. Whereas the L1bSc products report\ngeolocation data for each sounding, calibration products report the direction\nof the boresight vector.\n\nThis is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.",
