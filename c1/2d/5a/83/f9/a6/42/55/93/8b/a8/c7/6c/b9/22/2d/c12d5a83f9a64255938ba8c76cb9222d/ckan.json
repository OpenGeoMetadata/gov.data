    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose a feasibility study of a fully intgrated radiation hardened (&gt;1Mrad/si), programmable crystal oscilator (RPXO) in a miniature package that will deliver stable clock signal output under extreme temperature range from -230C to +200C. The innovations envisioned for RPXO will include a radiation hardened SiGe ASIC with HBT configuration for the analog section and CMOS configuration for the digital part. Recent research results of SiGe show excellent promise for a very wide operating temperature and high TID. Special design techniques will be studied and evaluated to reduce or eliminate SEL condition. Another innovation is an assembly that includes the crystal resonator and its mechanical support that will withstand the extreme temperature range as well as more than 2000 thermal cycles as experienced on Mars and Moon. Finite element analysis will be the main tool to establish confidence in the design study of the thermo-mechanical portions of the RPXO including package related mechanical interfaces. The microelecronic package will be commercially available and reflect a standard form-factor. It will hold all of the said elements and include provisions for programmability features of the RPXO. The package study will evaluate leadless version and compliant lead alternative configuration to facilitate the application of the device on PCB. All RPXO assembly process will be commercially viable and based on proven, and reliable techniques. ",
