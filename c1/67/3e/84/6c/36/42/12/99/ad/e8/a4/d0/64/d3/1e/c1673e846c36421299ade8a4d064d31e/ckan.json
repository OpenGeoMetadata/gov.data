Playa wetlands were digitized by \"heads-up digitizing\" for 46 counties in western Kansas from multiple years of 1- to 2-m resolution color aerial photographs collected as part of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), available for the years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, Digital Raster Graphics and SSURGO soils data. Ground-based investigations and aerial investigations via low-altitude aircraft were used for \"ground truthing\" of the dataset based on simple absence/presence criteria.",
