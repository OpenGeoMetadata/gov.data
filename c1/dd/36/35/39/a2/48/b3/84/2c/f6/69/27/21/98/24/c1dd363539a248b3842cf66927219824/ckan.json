  "notes": "This dataset represents the state maintained primary and secondary road network of Louisiana. The dataset includes Interstates, US highways, and Louisiana State Highways. This dataset was compiled by Louisiana State University from LDOTD source data. The dataset improved upon an existing digital map (linework) that had no attributes. The source dataset was derived from sources including USGS quads, aerial photography, highway plans, DOTD's control section road network and existing general highway maps. The source data set originated in 1983-1985 by digitizing 7.5' USGS quads on high precision input tables, but is updated regularly at LDOTD using the other sources mentioned above.",
