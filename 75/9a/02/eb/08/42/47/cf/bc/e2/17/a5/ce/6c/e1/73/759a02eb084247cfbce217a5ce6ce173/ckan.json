    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This dataset contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS)\n                        level 3 geophysical parameters derived using the physical retrieval\n                        method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data\n                        Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at\n                        NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori\n                        data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the\n                        TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution\n                        Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave\n                        Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting\n                        Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional\n                        temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to\n                        profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to\n                        derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature,\n                        outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total\n                        ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n                        \n                        The Path A system steps through an interactive\n                        forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a\n                        2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to\n                        generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These\n                        global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring\n                        within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These\n                        retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements\n                        (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an\n                        Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data\n                        Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This\n                        analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6\n                        hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n                        \n                        The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the\n                        iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine\n                        (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature\n                        profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the\n                        difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the\n                        brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the\n                        full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite\n                        zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated\n                        layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of\n                        multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients\n                        given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon\n                        the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the\n                        iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n                        \n                        There are 6 level 3 data product files, each of which is in the HDF\n                        format and each representative of a different averaging time\n                        period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter\n                        arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods\n    ...",
