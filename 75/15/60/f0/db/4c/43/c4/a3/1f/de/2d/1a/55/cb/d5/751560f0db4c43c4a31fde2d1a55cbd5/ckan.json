    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The unique built-in design features of the proposed mini pulse tube cryocooler avoid all thermal expansion issues enabling it to operate within a cold, 150 K environment.  As such, the cooler addresses the need to prevent boiloff of cryogenic propellants on long duration remote missions.\r\n\r\nDue to its high heat capacity regenerator matrix, the cooler has a high efficiency and a small footprint, making its launch mass minimal.  The coherent regenerator matrix configuration prevents movement and so prevents degradation over time.  Due to its unique compressor being cold-tolerant down to 150 K the cooler can keep running even where the sun is so far away and dim that the energy captured by the spacecraft cannot keep the compressor warm.  The compressor being designed to run cold and on minimal input power allows it to run at the inherently low solar intensity, which seriously depresses solar cell power generation.\r\n\r\nIn all, our cryocooler innovation is an enabling technology for far-flung missions that have the need to preserve mission propellants in their liquefied state until needed to maneuver near a destination or a midway point.\r\n\r\nThe design concept calls for: 1) Using regenerator materials from a recently developed class of high heat capacity rare earth alloys;  2) A compressor and coldhead design optimized for a low temperature heat sink;  3) Minimizing the known losses in the pulse tube proper.  The cryocooler design will be possible due to the long standing cryocooler design and manufacture heritage of the team members.\r\n\r\nPhase I will verify the low temperature capabilities down to 150 K of an available mini compressor, and, will put forth the design of the crucial components of a complete 0.3 W at 35 K cryocooler targeted to run in a 150 K environment.\r\n\r\nPhase II will build and test a complete prototype cryocooler that is small in size and power consumption enabling long durations missions to planetary objects at remote locations within the solar system.",
