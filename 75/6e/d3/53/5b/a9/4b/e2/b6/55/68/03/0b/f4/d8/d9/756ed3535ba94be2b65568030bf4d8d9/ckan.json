  "notes": "The Columbia River is an important resource for fish and wildlife, and a number of National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) were established along the river to protect migratory birds, species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and habitats necessary for the survival of these species. Fish and wildlife are exposed to environmental contaminants entering the Columbia River from point and nonpoint sources. Even when released in small concentrations, some contaminants can biomagnify and harm top level predators, and can impact species using NWR lands. We collected sediment, invertebrates, fish, and eggs of piscivorous and non-piscivorous birds in 1990 and 1991 within various river segments to determine contaminant concentrations, compare concentrations within river segments, identify concentrations in biota that exceed guidance or reference levels, evaluate the magnitude of exceedances using hazard quotients (HQs), and derive biomagnification factors (BMFs) for persistent, bioaccumulative compounds. BMFs were used to develop target fish concentrations (TFCs), or the concentrations in fish estimated to be protective of upper trophic level species such as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). We collected samples in the lower Columbia River below Bonneville Dam (four river segments including three NWRs), at Umatilla NWR and above McNary Dam, and in the lower Willamette River near Portland. We found most organochlorine (OC) pesticides were below detection in sediment in biota. However, similar to previous and concurrent studies, the pesticide transformation products DDE and DDD were the most commonly detected and most elevated compounds in biota from both rivers. DDE was detected in all fish samples during both years of the study, and in nearly all samples of clams and bird eggs. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), represented as total Aroclor PCBs or by summing individual congeners, were commonly found in fish and bird egg samples, but were rarely detected in sediment or invertebrates. Mercury was detected in all invertebrates and birds eggs, and in most fish sampled. In invertebrates, mercury was below estimated guidance values for the protection of avian invertebrate predators, but some fish samples exceeded these guidance values. Mercury in eggs of some piscivorous birds in the lower river segments exceeded values associated with impaired reproduction in sensitive individuals. Although bioaccumulative contaminants were near or below detection limits in sediment and invertebrates, our results document biomagnification of some OC compounds to concentrations likely resulting in adverse impacts to piscivorous birds. Results did not indicate that individual river segments differed in their contribution to the contaminant concentrations observed in biota. This trend indicates that the river receives contaminants from numerous widespread sources, and that contaminants were evenly distributed in biota. The role of bed sediment in contaminant transfer to biota in the river is unknown, and additional information is needed to characterize this role and to develop better management strategies for bed sediment disturbance. We recommend a basin-wide strategy to better control release of bioaccumulative contaminants to the river and minimize impacts to fish-eating birds, to monitor changes in OC contaminants over time, and to better address contaminant uptake from sediment sources.",
