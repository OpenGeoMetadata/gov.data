    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to mature technologies and systems that will enable future Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems. Advanced EVA systems have applicability to all future human spaceflight missions. Advanced EVA systems have applications to current operations on the International Space Station (ISS), to extended operations on ISS past 2020, future missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) such as satellite servicing, missions beyond LEO such as exploration of asteroids, and surface exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. An EVA system would be a significant element of any future human exploration mission and will enable suitport operations in a Deep Space Habitat or Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV). The Human Exploration Framework Team (HEFT) ranked EVA systems as one of the top five needed areas of future development for human space flight. The goal is to produce real cost, performance, and reliability data through building and testing high fidelity systems, culminating in a flight demonstration on ISS of an exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). The current plan leading to this flight demonstration consists of subsystem demonstrations of increasing fidelity. These demonstrations would produce hardware and systems that could then be combined into a complete EVA system which would be used in human thermal-vacuum chamber tests and finally in a flight demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;",
