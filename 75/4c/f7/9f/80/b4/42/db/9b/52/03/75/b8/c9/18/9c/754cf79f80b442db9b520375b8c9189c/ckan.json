The data were acquired in concert with a multibeam bathymetry survey of St. John Shelf, off the coast of United States Virgin Islands in 2010. Fish densities are presented by size classes, corresponding to individual lengths inferred from the intensity of acoustic target return, in units of fish per 100 square meters.",
