  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Fleet Aviation Maintenance Organic Support (FAMOS) Laboratory at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ provides rapid engineering support to fleet aviation maintenance both ashore and afloat.  Function:  The FAMOS Lab is able to quickly and effectively respond to fleet needs through a variety capabilities such as product development, testing, troubleshooting, engineering change proposal (ECP) and engineering investigation (EI) support. All of these capabilities can be conducted on site to directly support and aid fleet readiness.  Capabilities:  The FAMOS Lab utilizes various pieces of equipment to meet its mission of providing rapid engineering support to the fleet. Most notable is the FAMOS Lab&amp;#39;s Aircraft Engine Components Test Stand (AECTS), the Hydraulic Components Test Stand (HCTS) and the Aircraft Hydraulic Tubing Fabrication Unit. The AECTS and HCTS support a variety of aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and unmanned air vehicles. The Aircraft Hydraulic Tubing Fabrication Unit provides the capability of developing non-standard metals for emerging aircraft hydraulic systems. All of these units combine to provide cost-effective, timely solutions for emerging aircraft system maintenance requirements. The FAMOS Lab also supports testing, troubleshooting, ECPs and EIs for electrical ground power equipment to include land-based and shipboard mobile electric power plants, static frequency converters and mobile load banks. The lab permits detailed component and system level testing not only during development, but through the life cycle of all the systems. The lab can also be used to assess system performance when faced with emerging aircraft power requirements, and provides the means to optimize ground power performance for these aircraft.   ",
