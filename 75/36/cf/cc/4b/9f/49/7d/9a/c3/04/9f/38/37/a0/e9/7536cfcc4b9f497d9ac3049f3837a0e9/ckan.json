    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A new multidisciplinary software environment ('MUSE') will be developed for the simulation of flight vehicles, drawing on the results of recent research on very fast algorithms, performed at Stanford University under Professor Antony Jameson's guidance.  This new technology will be merged with Intelligent Aerodynamics' finite element methology implemented in the product FASTPLANE.  This code, which uses multigrid acceleration techniques and is fully parallelized, can already perform^Msteady-state simulations of complete aircraft in less than 5 minutes on a 16 processor Beowulf cluster. The synergy resulting from the technology transfer will lead to a new level of capability for the simulation of both steady and unsteady flows, thus providing the platform needed to couple additional disciplines into an advanced multidisciplinary tool for aero-structural and thermal analysis.  It can also provide the platform for a new generation of design-optimization software using the adjoint methodology developed by Antony Jameson and his collaborators during the last decade.  Moreover, with further advances in the performance of computer hardware that can be anticipated, real time simulation of flight vehicles should in the future be feasible with this new software. This would provide a powerful new tool to support flight-testing.\r\n",
