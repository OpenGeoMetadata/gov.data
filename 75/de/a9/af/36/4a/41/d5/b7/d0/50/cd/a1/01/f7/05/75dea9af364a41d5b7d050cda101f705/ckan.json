Stream, Lagoon or Other Waste Waster (not including tailwater recovery) as an Irrigation Source is described as an \"impoundment made by excavation or earthfill for biological treatment of animal or other agricultural waste.\" (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) This data set was created with geographic information systems (GIS) and database management tools. The acres on which LWWIS's are applied were totaled at the county level in the tabular NRI database and then apportioned to a raster coverage of agricultural land within the county based on the Enhanced National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) 1-kilometer resolution land cover grids (Nakagaki, 2003). Federal land is not considered in this analysis because NRI does not record information on those lands.",
