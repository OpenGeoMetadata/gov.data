  "notes": "In 2005, a four-year investigation was initiated by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 2 Law Enforcement special agents within the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. The purpose of this investigation was to determine Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) compliance of oil field operations within these states. The objective of the overall investigation was to determine the number of oil pits in non-compliance with the MBTA as well as those within compliance in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Data collected in these investigations included physical locations of oil pits mapped using Global Positioning Satellite technology; compliance status of these oil pits; and the total and number of migratory birds found in these pits. Dead migratory birds observed in these oil pits were recovered by established field methods and submitted to the National Fish and Wildlife Service Forensic Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, for identification purposes following strict line of evidence procedures. Subsequent target letters were issued to the offending parties (i.e., lease holder, operator, etc.) via certified mail providing potential violations, recommended compliance measures, and compliance schedules. Citations, fines and other actions were levied as appropriate. Over the course of the four year investigation, a total of 2,072 sites were inspected during 30 details. Six hundred and sixty five birds (665) were recovered during this period with 590 of those birds recovered identified as migratory. Approximately $259,800 in fines were collected from the oil companies that were found to be in violation of the MBTA.",
