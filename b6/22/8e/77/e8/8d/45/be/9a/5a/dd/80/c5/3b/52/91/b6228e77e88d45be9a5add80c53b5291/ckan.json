    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Biomedical Engineering and Research Laboratory is working with the NASA Life Support group and BCS Life Support to improve the safety of the environmental control units (ECUs) used in the self-contained atmospheric-protective ensemble (SCAPE) suits at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). ECUs are liquid-air-based backpacks that allow operators to work in hazardous environments for up to 2 hours. Though ECUs have been used at KSC with great success for over&amp;nbsp;30 years, some ECU deficiencies have required mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the breathing commodity is liquid, the liquid pickup in the dewar can come out of the fluid if the dewar is near the end of its service life and if the operator lies on his side. This can prevent air from flowing in the SCAPE suit. Furthermore, the ECUs have no liquid level sensors to indicate to the operator that the unit is running low on air. BCS Life Support has invented a novel liquid pickup system that will allow the ECU to operate safely in the horizontal position. The system has a liquid level sensor that will warn the operator when the commodity is at 25&#37;.&amp;nbsp;The overall objective for this project was to evaluate two candidate alternatives for the existing Propellant Handler&amp;rsquo;s Ensemble (PHE) escape ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;",
