  "notes": "A Level III Contaminant Preaquisition Survey was conducted during 1992 in the south San Diego Bay area to evaluate potential hazards to trustee resources and/or liabilities to the Service. Potential contaminant problems were urban runoff and pollutants associated with shipyards and marinas, and the fact that elevated levels of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons are known to exist in portions of San Diego Bay. Data from several environmental contaminant studies in the San Diego Bay during 1991-1992 were included in this Level III Survey. Sediments, aquatic plants, marine invertebrates, fishes, birds and bird eggs received chemical analysis. Information from the sediment samples was considered most useful in terms of determining if a particular area was directly contaminated. Data from biota samples was evaluated to determine if a more widespread contamination problem may exist, but would not necessarily indicate the area under consideration for acquisition was the contamination source. Sediments at three sites contained metals exceeding certain guidelines for the protection of aquatic organisms, but none were considered high enough to require clean-up, nor should they prohibit the parcel's acquisition. Those locations were Site N2 (copper, nickel and zinc), Site O (copper) and Site G (lead and nickel). However, N1 (a site very near N2) did not have similarly elevated levels of either copper, nickel or zinc. Therefore, the distribution of metal contaminants in south San Diego Bay sediments is apparently not homogeneous. PCB's were not detected in sediment samples, but were detected in biota samples at levels below hazard thresholds. Aliphatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, organotins and most organochlorine (OC) pesticides were largely nondetectable in sediments and food-chain biota, or were at levels below most hazard thresholds. However, the eggs of all bird species had elevated concentrations of DDT-related compounds which is likely from the DDE contamination previously documented in coastal southern California. Based upon these results, metals in sediments were most elevated at Sites N2, O, and G, but were not at levels that would require clean-up or prohibit acquisition. PCB's, aliphatics, PAHs, organotins and most OC pesticides were not considered to be problems in the sediments sampled. Biota samples contained a variety of contaminants, but those would be from exposures occurring throughout the bay, and not necessarily related to the specific areas under consideration for the south San Diego Bay Refuge. No site specific contamination issues were identified in this survey that would require remedial action nor any that should prohibit acquisition of the areas under consideration for the South San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).",
