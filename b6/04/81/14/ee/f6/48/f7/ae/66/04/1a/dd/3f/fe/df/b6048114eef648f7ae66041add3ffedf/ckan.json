It is also required if levees are shown on the FIRM, channels containing the flooding are shown on the FIRM, or any other structure that impacts the area?s flood risk is shown on the FIRM. The accompanying attribute table contains information about the hydraulic structures within the study area. It should include all structures shown in the flood profiles. In addition, levees, sea walls, channels that contain flooding, and other significant flood control structures shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) should be included. Spatial elements representing general structures are represented by lines. The lines should represent the primary characteristic of the structure. For example, bridges should be represented by the transportation centerline carried by the bridge. Dams should be represented by a line corresponding to the top of the dam. Levees should be represented by a line corresponding to the top of levee. A line corresponding to the centerline of the main barrel should represent a culvert.",
