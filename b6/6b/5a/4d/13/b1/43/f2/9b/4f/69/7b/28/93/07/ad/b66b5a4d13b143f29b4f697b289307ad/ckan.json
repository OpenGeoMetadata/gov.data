    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Wide-bandgap SiC semiconductors have been recently investigated for use in power devices, because of their potential capabilities of operating at high power densities, high temperatures and at high frequencies and thus offering advantages such as high efficiency, small size and light weight.  Currently a few power devices based on SiC technology have been demonstrated and commercialized. Therefore, an opportunity exists to develop and demonstrate a SiC power inverter, showing the system-level impacts of using commercially available SiC power devices compared with an Si-based inverter, and addressing the related technical issues/risks of implementing SiC technology. Following a successful demonstration of the concept feasibility in Phase I, Phase II research will fully develop, demonstrate, model, and characterize a three-phase all SiC inverter. The inverter will be constructed through the integration of several supporting technologies including circuit design and device paralleling, high temperature packaging and thermal management, high temperature gate based on SOI technology, and other passive components. In the Phase II, the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of this SiC inverter will be addressed, and its technical/economical benefits will be analyzed.  By implementing technology developed, a high-efficiency, compact SiC inverter technology can be anticipated for potential NASA and other applications.\r\n\r\n",
