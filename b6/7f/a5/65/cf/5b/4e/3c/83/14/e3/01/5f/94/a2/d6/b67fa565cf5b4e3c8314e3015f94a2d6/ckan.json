    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Spacecraft and lunar bases generate a variety of wastes containing\nwater, including food wastes, feces, and brines.  Disposal of these\nwastes, as well as recovery of water, is necessary.  However,\nevaporation of water also evaporates compounds with foul odors, some of\nwhich are much more volatile than water.  Even apart from a water\nrecovery system, foul odors sap crew morale, and must be eliminated. NanoScale&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;REG&lt;/sup&gt;\n Corporation has developed a formulation of its proprietary sorbents,\ntermed OdorKlenz&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n, that has been shown to effectively remove odorous compounds from air\nby destructive adsorption.  NanoScale proposes development of a similar\nformulation, built around nanocrystalline metal oxides manufactured by\nNanoScale's proprietary procedures, such as NanoActive TiO2, NanoActive\nMgO, and NanoActive ZnO, to remove foul odors in a system that can\nrecover water from wastes.  The odor control system will function during\nwaste storage, and also during water recovery . In Phase I, NanoScale\nwill demonstrate feasibility by developing a formulation of metal oxides\ncapable of removing odorous compounds from food and sanitary wastes, and\ncompatible with a water recovery system.  Specific test compounds\ninclude skatole (3-methylindole, found in feces), putrescine\n(1,4-diaminobutane, in rotten protein), ammonia (urine), ethanethiol,\nhydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs, flatus), butyric acid (rancid butter),\nand butyraldehyde.  Gas streams containing these compounds will be\npassed through beds of the metal oxide formulation, with concentrations\nmeasured by GC, before and after passing through the bed.  In Phase II,\nthe odor control system will be integrated into the specific details of\nspacecraft and envisioned lunar stations.  Then, brassboard hardware\nwill be developed and evaluated. NanoScale, having pioneered the\nsynthesis and manufacture of nanocrystalline metal oxides for\ndestructive adsorption of hazardous compounds, is uniquely qualified to\nperform the proposed work.",
