This dataset was developed as part of the Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan funded by EPA. The data set was created by interpolation between 5 foot contour lines on 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps, and by interpretation of aerial photos and NWI Habitat Maps. The resultant was drawn on 1:24,000 scale maps, then digitized to create the dataset.",
