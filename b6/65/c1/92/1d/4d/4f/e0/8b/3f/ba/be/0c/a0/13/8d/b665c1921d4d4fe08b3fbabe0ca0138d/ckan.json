    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "MULTI-TEMPORAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGE CLASSIFICATION - A\r\nMULTI-VIEW APPROACH\r\n\r\nVARUN CHANDOLA* AND RANGA RAJU VATSAVAI*\r\n\r\nAbstract. Multispectral remote sensing images have been widely used for automated land use\r\nand land cover classification tasks. Often thematic classification is done using single date image,\r\nhowever in many instances a single date image is not informative enough to distinguish between\r\ndifferent land cover types. In this paper we show how one can use multiple images, collected at\r\ndifferent times of year (for example, during crop growing season), to learn a better classifier. We\r\npropose two approaches, an ensemble of classifiers approach and a co-training based approach, and\r\nshow how both of these methods outperform a straightforward stacked vector approach often used\r\nin multi-temporal image classification. Additionally, the co-training based method addresses the\r\nchallenge of limited labeled training data in supervised classification, as this classification scheme\r\nutilizes a large number of unlabeled samples (which comes for free) in conjunction with a small\r\nset of labeled training data.",
