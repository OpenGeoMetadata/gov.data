    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains two ASCII files (tab-delimited .txt format) that provide annual mean above-ground wood increments for temperate forests in 1,956 counties of the 28 eastern U.S. states. One file contains hardwood forest data and the other contains softwood forest data. The files provide estimates of above-ground biomass per county; county-level annual above-ground biomass growth, removals (harvest), and mortality of woody biomass per hectare; county-level total annual above-ground woody biomass production per hectare; forest area per county; mortality (%) in forests within each county; and total annual production and mortality per county. The data are derived from forest inventory data from 1960s to 1990s that were collected from an extensive network of permanent inventory plots as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA).Based on the analysis of the above-ground production data (Brown and Schroeder, 1999), above-ground production of woody biomass (APWB) for hardwood forests ranged from 0.6 to 28 Mg/ha/yr and averaged 5.2 Mg/ha/yr. For softwood forests, APWB ranged from 0.2 to 31 Mg/ha/yr and averaged 4.9 Mg/ha/yr. APWB was generally highest in southeastern and southern counties, mostly along an arc from southern Virginia to Louisiana and eastern Texas. No clear spatial pattern of mortality of woody biomass (MWB) existed, except for a distinct area of high mortality in South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. For hardwood forests, MWB ranged from 0 to 15 Mg/ha/yr and averaged 1.1 Mg/ha/yr. The average MWB for softwood forests was 0.6 Mg/ha/yr with a range of 0 to 10 Mg/ha/yr. The rate of above-ground MWB averaged <1%/yr for both hardwood and softwood forests.",
