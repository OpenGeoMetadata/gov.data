    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Ground testing of propulsion systems requires highly accurate and precise sensor systems.  Setting up such systems can be more time consuming than the test.  The myriad of analog connections are subject to environmental noise.  The ability to effectively calibrate sensors, digitize the signals in closer proximity to the sensor itself and to send real-unit data with sensor identification and time stamps is critical.  IEEE1451 provides specification for \"smart sensors\" of this type.  \r\n\r\nSensor fidelity and reliability are enhanced when the electronics are closer to the sensor.  This is difficult in propulsion systems because of the ambient temperatures.  High temperature electronics improve performance of such systems.  Orbital Research previously demonstrated electronics that drive sensors, digitize the results and provide data analysis using a high performance, high temperature microprocessor.  The system has a common bus for transmitting the data.  The demonstrated system interfaces with any one of 8 sensor types.\r\n\r\nDuring this program the system will be refined and expanded to enable multi-variate calibration, sensor identification, and time stamping.  Ensuring adequate resolution for the ground test sensors is also a key objective.  It will also require software development to accomplish the identified smart sensor functionality.  All developments will be compliant with IEEE1451.\r\n",
