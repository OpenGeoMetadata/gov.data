    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tA magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based exoskeleton leg demonstrator was developed to help long duration exploration mission crews obtain exercise with entertainment during flight and at their destination.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tA novel exercise and recreation device is proposed that can provide physical and mental health preservation benefits during long duration deep space exploration missions. A prototype based on MR dampers was built to demonstrate the technology. However, this will need to be modified to drive forces through major leg bones and muscles to realize medical benefits and present to NASA exercise scientists for evaluation. Very light weight, compact exercise devices are considered a necessity for long duration space flight missions. Existing ISS countermeasures are not only functional limited, but also bulky, complex and require high maintenance. The proposed MR exoskeleton is light weight, compact sized, and capable of providing concentric and eccentric exercises. With the integration of Microsoft XBox Kinnect, the exoskeleton will have full range of flexibility-personalized exercise profile, data tracking, down-linking, and recreation activities: immersive video games and aquatic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
