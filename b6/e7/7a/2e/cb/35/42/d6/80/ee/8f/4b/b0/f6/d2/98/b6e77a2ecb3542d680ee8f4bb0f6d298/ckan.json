    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current combustor design simulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel-lean combustion have entailed using large amounts of dedicated CPU resources for extended time periods due to the expense of solving detailed, strongly-coupled, chemical kinetic models.  Such models are inherently data parallel, and much faster solutions can be obtained using low-cost graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware without loss of accuracy.  This proposal describes development of a user-friendly software toolkit that facilitates implementing detailed or reduced fuel chemistry solvers directly onto GPUs to substantially accelerate CFD simulation runtimes.  The approach is significant because it provides a cost-effective path to substantially reduce the wall-clock times currently bottlenecking high-fidelity combustion simulations.  It accommodates the incorporation of self-contained, real fuel kinetic mechanisms and validated chemistry solvers, written using standard GPU-recognized program language extensions such as CUDA and OpenCL, for use in CFD analyses with minimal end-user code modifications.  Using inputs that are Chemkin-format compatible, the proposed software toolkit will generate portable, GPU-enabled kernels that can be directly compiled into existing CFD codes, such as the National Combustion Code (NCC), to accelerate detailed combustion simulations for improved design support.",
