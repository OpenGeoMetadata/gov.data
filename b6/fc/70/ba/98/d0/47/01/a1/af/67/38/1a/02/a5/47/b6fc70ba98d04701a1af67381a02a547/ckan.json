    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Power systems are the core heartbeat of any advanced vehicle.  Reliability and flexibility of these systems are therefore of the highest priority.  This Phase 1 project proposes a highly efficient and modular isolated bidirectional DC converter for battery energy applications.  GridBridge is utilizing advanced DC converter topologies for modernization of the today's electrical distribution power grid and will translate work into high priority NASA power system applications, demonstrating transferability, robustness, and scalability.  This bidirectional DC converter offers an extremely high power density and will utilize a novel hybrid resonance and PWM technique to achieve.  It will also offer NASA the flexibility for many power system topologies, including: distributing large single cells throughout the vehicle, use of smaller cells in a centralized location, or a combination banked smaller cells distributed throughout the system.  This is accomplished through independent charging and discharging control of state-of-charge and state-of-health for each battery module, inherent active maximum current limit and short-circuit protection, and ease of module balancing.",
