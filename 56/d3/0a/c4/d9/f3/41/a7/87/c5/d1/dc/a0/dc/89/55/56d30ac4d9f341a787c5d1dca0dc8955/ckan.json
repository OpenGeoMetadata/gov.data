    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The second release of Collection 3 OMI/Aura level-2G daily global gridded (0.25x0.25 deg) Aerosol data product OMAEROG (Version 003 has been made available to the public in March 2012 from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), see http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaerog_v003.shtml \n                \n  OMI provides two aerosol products OMAERUV and OMAERO that are based on two different algorithms. The OMAERUV product uses the near-UV algorithm. The OMAERO product is based on the multi-wavelength algorithm that uses up to 20 wavelength bands between 331 nm and 500 nm. OMAERO retrieval algorithm is developed by the KNMI OMI Team Scientists. Drs. Deborah Stein-Zweers, Martin Sneep and Pepijn Veefkind are now the key investigators of this product. The OMAERO product contains Aerosol Optical Depths, Single Scatterin Albedo and other ancillary and geolocation informations. \n \n (The shortname for this Level-2G Global Gridded Aerosol Product is OMAEROG_V003) \n This Level-2G daily global gridded product OMAEROG is based on the pixel level OMI Level-2 Aerosol product OMAERO. OMAEROG is a special Level-2 gridded product where pixel level products are binned into 0.25x0.25 degree global grids. It contains the data for all scenes that have observation time betweeen UTC times of 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.9999 . All data pixels that fall in a grid box are saved without averaging. Scientist can apply data filtering scheme of their choice and create new gridded products. The GES DISC developed interactive tool Giovanni (  http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) provides web based capabilities to browse and explore these data.   \n\nThe OMAEROG data product contains almost all parameters that are contained in OMAERO. For example, in addition to the extinction optical depth, single scattering albedo it also contains aerosol indices, cloud fraction, cloud pressure, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and extensive quality flags.\n\nOMAEROG files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains daily data from approximately 15 orbits . The maximum file size for the OMAEROG data product is about 78 Mbytes.",
