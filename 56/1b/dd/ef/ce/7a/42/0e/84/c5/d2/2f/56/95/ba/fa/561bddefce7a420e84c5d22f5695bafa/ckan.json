    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains the original model output data submissions from the 24 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) that participated in the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis. The model teams generated estimates for, but not limited to,  a minimum of six variables, including gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) for each of 47 selected eddy covariance flux tower sites across North America. Participating modeling teams followed the NACP Site Synthesis Protocol (site_synthesis_protocol_v7.pdf), which covers procedures, plans, and infrastructure for the site-level analyses. File format and units conversions of several data submissions were made by the MAST-DC to produce NetCDF files of consistent content and structure for all 24 TBM outputs. The model outputs are structured as described in Appendix A: Model Output Variables, of the Site Synthesis Protocol. In addition, MAST-DC processed these original model submissions to derive uniquely processed and formatted data files for model inter-comparison and evaluation (NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format). This related data set provides GPP, NEE, LAI, Re, LE, and sensible heat (H) model output variables at the native half-hourly time step, and in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations. The related data set also contains gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates at the same time steps.There are 24 compressed (*.zip) files with this data set -- one file for each model. When expanded, the .zip files contain model output data files for flux tower sites in NetCDF and some in text formats.",
