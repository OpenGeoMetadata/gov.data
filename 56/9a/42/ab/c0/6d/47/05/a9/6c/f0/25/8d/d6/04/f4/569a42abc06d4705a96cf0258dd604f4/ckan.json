  "notes": " FUNCTION: Develops and evaluates the effectiveness of electronic attack (EA) techniques against antiship cruise missiles. All terminal countermeasures programmed in the active AN/SLQ-32(V) area threat libraries are developed, tested, and evaluated in this facility in open- and closed-loop testconfigurations. Measures of effectiveness of the EA waveforms against the missiles are obtained through closed-loop testing. DESCRIPTION: The hardware-in-the-loop facility is instrumented to test antiship missiles operating in the I and J bands of the frequency spectrum with the capability for up to two targets, such as a ship and chaff, in the scenarios. The two targets alternatively can also be implemented to simulate two ships, each having an onboard active electronic warfare (EW) system. Missile radar seekers are mounted on a two-axis pedestal that allows closed-loop evaluation in the azimuth and elevation planes. The engagement and associated kinematics are developed using computer-controlled interactions between the pedestal and fixed and moving horns. The fixed horn is implemented using synthetic line of sight. Signals radiated in the direction of the missile radar seeker simulate targets as seen by the missile seeker, including pulse-by-pulse seeker antenna patterns, ship cross-sectional area, range attenuation, and scintillation effects. EA returns are radiated to also include the effects of seeker antenna patterns, range attenuation, and realistic jamming-to-signal ratios. The missile autopilot aerodynamics modeling is done in real time using an Applied Dynamics Real-Time System (ADRTS) with the capability of collecting and displaying more than 50 channels of data. The antiship missile model library includes many of today&amp;#39;s threats. INSTRUMENTATION: EA equipment includes operational Fleet techniques generators, advanced waveform generators with capability to do cross-pole jamming, anda digital RF memory unit (DRFM) to replicate frequency agile return signals delayed in time and closing at antiship missile velocities. The facility instrumentation assets include an Astro-Med strip-chart recorder, RF spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes, RF power meters, and microwave sources for generating target signatures, including traveling wave tube (TWT) and solid-state, microwave, and wideband amplifiers.
