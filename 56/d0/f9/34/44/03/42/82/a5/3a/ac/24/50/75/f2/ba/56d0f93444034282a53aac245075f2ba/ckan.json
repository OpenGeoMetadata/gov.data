  "notes": "February 2015 Progress report for Targeted Chronic Wasting Disease Project in Montana Hunting District 600. From February 5-6th, 25 mule deer were captured in hunting district 600 north of Chinook, MT and south of the Canadian border as part of a collaborative project with the USFWS. The study aims to improve the risk assessment of CWD moving into Montana through the use of testing and location monitoring. 20 adult males and 5 adult females were captured via net gun by the Quicksilver helicopter crew. Once an animal was netted Dr. Jennifer Ramsey and Keri Carson were flown to the animal, it was then injected with BAM and once fully sedated a rectal biopsy was taken for CWD sampling, a blood sample for serology, a fecal for parasite analysis, and a gene card for future genetics work if needed. Each animal was fitted with a Lotek GPS Lifecycle collar and a silver metal ear tag.  Initial efforts called for capturing 10 adult females, but unfortunately 5 of the collars were too small to be deployed.  On 2/24/15 we were alerted to our first collar mortality on an adult male. Scott Hemmer and Tim Roth investigated and were able to get very close to the bedded down deer before it flushed and fled the area. On 2/25/15 the collar went on mortality again and the carcass was retrieved and brought to the lab on 2/26/15. A necropsy and further tests are pending. 23 of the 25 animals were tested for CWD by Colorado State University Diagnostic Lab. CWD was not detected in those animals. The two biopsies that were not tested were not sufficient for the test requirements. Serologic testing and parasitology results are pending.",
