  "notes": "Educational Technology and Teacher Education Programs for Initial Licensure, 2006 (PEQIS 15), is a study that is part of the Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQIS) program; program data is available since 1997 at <http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/peqis/>. PEQIS 15 (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2008040) is a cross-sectional survey that collected information about teacher education programs for initial licensure of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade (PK-12) teachers. Title IV four-year degree-granting postsecondary institutions located in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia were sampled. The study was conducted using questionnaires for all eligible four-year institutions in the United States as identified from the 2004 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \"Institutional Characteristics\" survey (IPEDS-IC). The study's response rate was 95 percent. Key statistics produced from PEQIS 15 include information on the educational technology-related topics and practices taught within teacher education programs for initial licensure, the extent to which teacher candidates are taught to use technology tools for a variety of purposes, the extent to which teacher candidates are able to practice what they learn during their field experiences (and the extent to which this opportunity is impeded by a variety of barriers within classrooms), and the perceived program outcomes for graduates of programs for initial licensure.",
