    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Human exploration of space demands highly efficient, light-weight, long lifetime and maintenance-free power generation systems.  Energy storage applications, human-rated exploration vehicles, in-space propulsion systems, un-manned aerial vehicles, robotic and manned rovers require steady state output electricity generation to maximize the operational capabilities and successfully achieve complex missions.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cell systems offer the highest efficiency and the lowest weight energy conversion systems to generate electricity for space applications. The efficiency and lifetime of the current PEM fuel cell systems is mainly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts.  Lynntech proposes a novel electro-catalytic approach with an advanced ORR electrocatalyst that utilizes a stabilized platinum alloy supported on an electrically/ionically conductive mixed oxide that addresses the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art ORR Pt Black or carbon supported catalysts. Alloying with transition metals improves the microstructural properties of platinum and increases ORR rate, therefore increases the efficiency.  The mixed oxide component effectively decomposes peroxide radicals and suppresses the peroxide radical production, which minimizes the peroxide radical damages on the membrane, hence leading to significant increase in the fuel cell stack lifetime.
