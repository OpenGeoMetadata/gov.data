  "notes": "This data set consists of general soil association units. It was develped by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined. Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",

Hardcopies utilizing these data shall clearly indicate their source. User agrees not to misrepresent these data, nor to imply that changes made were approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily for regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource planning, management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs. When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the soil map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components. The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis. The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are periodically updated. Data are versioned, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the product.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
