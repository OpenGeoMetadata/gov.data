    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Martian atmospheric gases are a very important resource for surface missions on the red planet. However, their utilization for the production of hydrocarbons, oxygen, and water into&amp;nbsp;in situ resource utilization (ISRU)&amp;nbsp;systems requires that they be separated from their original mixture. Trace gases must be extracted to provide pure carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to processing reactors. In addition, other Martian gases, such as nitrogen and argon, occur in concentrations high enough to be useful as buffer gas and should be captured as well. To achieve these goals, highly efficient gas separation processes will be required. These gas separation techniques are also required across various areas within the ISRU project to support various consumable production processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Living off the land&amp;rdquo; with resources indigenous to a planetary body such as Mars, or ISRU, requires mission-enabling capabilities that will be a necessary part of further exploration of the solar system. It is vital to demonstrate the practicality of these technologies for future Martian missions. Current work, focusing on developing a first-generation Mars ISRU demonstration lander for atmospheric and soil processing operations, is being performed as a multicenter NASA effort. Work on the Mars Atmosphere and Regolith COllector/PrOcessor for Lander Operations (MARCO POLO) project&amp;nbsp;is aimed at using Martian resources to produce methane, oxygen, and hydrogen for use as rocket propellant and fuel cell consumables.&lt;/p&gt;",
