  "notes": "This GIS shapefile data illustrates reinvestment centers included in the Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan Vision. Reinvestment centers highlight communities that already serve as anchors for surrounding areas, or could serve as anchors in the future. Centers were determined based upon a combination of land use density and functional characteristics such as regional location and links to major transportation corridors. Example centers serve to illustrate reinvestment opportunity areas derived through discussions with local officials, as well as qualitative and quantitative analysis, but do not comprise an exhaustive list. Many rural communities do not appear on the map. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Planning process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
