  "notes": "This part of SIM 3254 presents data for the seafloor-character map (see sheet 7, SIM 3254) of the Offshore of Ventura map area, California. The raster data file is included in \"SeafloorCharacter_OffshoreVentura.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreVentura/data_catalog_OffshoreVentura.html. This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes in the Offshore of Ventura map area. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been colored to indicate which of the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes they belong: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), and Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees). Depth Zones 1 (intertidal) and 4 to 5 (greater than 100 m), as well as Slopes Classes 2 to 4 (greater than 5Å™), are not present in this map area. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
