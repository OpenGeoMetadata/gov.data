  "notes": " \n        The road sector plays a critical role because 99% of goods produced in Senegal are transported by roads. Because the elected segments of RN 2 and RN 6 have a commercially and politically central geographical location and because of their poor initial state their rehabilitation should have a detectible positive effect on local populations (column 3, 4 and 6.)   Implementers rehabilitate the road segments of RN2 and RN6 under the supervision of MCC and MCA (Activities). The byproduct of the activities performed is the rehabilitated roads: 120 km and 256 km of rehabilitated RN2 and RN6 road segments, respectively (Outputs). Note that unexpected delays in the implementation have occurred because of environment factors, such as extreme weather and civil unrest. These contingencies can prevent the timely rehabilitation of the roads. There may be other factors that affect the road rehabilitation project. For example, there could be cost overruns that reduce the length of roads that end up being rehabilitated (outputs), thus affecting fewer beneficiaries than planned (outcomes).\n\nSome outcomes may be realized immediately upon completion of the project, while others may take longer to materialize. Once the road rehabilitation implementation is complete, it is expected that the time and cost required to travel to a certain destination via the rehabilitated roads will be reduced. Also, the targeted road segments will be improved in quality and are thus likely to be used more frequently. These outcomes are expected to be realized shortly after the completion of the roads (short-term outcomes).  \nThe completion of the road rehabilitation is also expected to unlock economic and social opportunities for households and individuals using the road (medium/long-term outcomes). For example, the project may improve access to markets to buy and sell products. It may also be easier and cheaper to find inputs needed for production activities for both formal enterprises and household informal economic activities. Due to the reduced time and cost of travel on the rehabilitated roads, households may enjoy easier access to basic facilities such as schools and health centers. Furthermore, there may be more employment opportunities due to increased demand in markets accessible via the improved roads. Lastly, the value of land and assets along the rehabilitated roads is expected to rise as demand for the road use rises. \n\nResearch Question 1: Did the RRP reduce the travel time and costs to households/enterprises located near the rehabilitated roads?\n\nResearch Question 2: Did the RRP lead to increased work opportunities for employment and income among beneficiary households?\n\nResearch Question 3: Did the RRP lead to increased access to health and education services?\n\nResearch Question 4: Did the project affect business opportunities and enterprise revenues? \n\nResearch Question 5: What is the ex-post Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the RRP?\n\nResearch Question 6: How are the benefits of the projects distributed among subgroups of the population such as gender, age and income?\n\nResearch Question 7: How do the long-term impacts of the road projects per dollar invested compare to other typical infrastructure investments?\n      ",
