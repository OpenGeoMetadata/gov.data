  "notes": "After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates\n          Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) for the tabulation and dissemination of decennial\n          census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data, American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS data,\n          and ACS period estimates. Nesting within states, or equivalent entities, PUMAs cover the\n          entirety of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. PUMA\n          delineations are subject to population, building block geography, geographic nesting, and\n          contiguity criteria. Each PUMA is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may\n          contain leading zeros and a descriptive name.\n          \n          The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic\n          information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated\n          Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a\n          seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line\n          shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined\n          to cover the entire nation.
