    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The future of the NASA space program includes longer and more invasive missions into space, with a goal to return to the moon's surface by the year 2015.  Long duration storage of large quantities of cryogenic fluids for propulsion, power, and life-support is an essential requirement for these missions.  The behavior of active and passive cryogenic management is paramount to the thermal status of a spaceship and cryotanks storage.  Efficient and reliable insulation materials are key to the success of long missions into space.  Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop a durable and cost effective hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system for cryogenic storage in space applications.  The proposed hybrid insulation system will withstand micrometeoroids impacts and will outperform the MLI in cases of vacuum loss.  During the Phase II Program, extensive work will be dedicated to the developing a system level solution for installation of the flexible hybrid insulation system onto cryotank surfaces to minimize seams, and thermal leaks.  Development of the proposed novel cost effective insulation package will provide NASA with a long-term cryogenic propellant storage thermal control solution for applications in low earth orbit (LEO), and on the lunar surface.
