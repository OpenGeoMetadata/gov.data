  "notes": "Soils of abandoned mines on the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) are contaminated with arsenic, barium, mercury, manganese, lead, and zinc. Previous studies have shown that trace element and metal concentrations in bats were elevated above threshold concentrations. High trace element and metal concentrations in bats suggested that bighorn sheep also may be exposed to these contaminants when using abandoned mines as resting areas. We found evidence of bighorn sheep use, bighorn sheep carcasses, and scat in several abandoned mines. To determine whether bighorn sheep are exposed to, and are accumulating hazardous levels of metals while using abandoned mines, we collected soil samples, as well as scat and bone samples when available. We compared mine soil concentrations to Arizona non-residential clean up levels. Hazard quotients were elevated in several mines and elevated for manganese in one Sheep Tank Mine sample. We analyzed bighorn sheep tissues for trace elements. We obtained blood, liver, and bone samples from hunter-harvested bighorn in 2000 and 2001. Arizona Game and Fish Department also collected blood from bighorn during a translocation operation in 2001. Iron and magnesium were elevated in tissues compared to reference literature concentrations in other species. Most often, domestic sheep baseline levels were used for comparison because of limited available data for bighorn sheep. All other metals data were within normal ranges. Patterns of elevated tissue accumulation were: copper and iron in blood; barium, cadmium, manganese, and zinc in liver; and lead, strontium, and magnesium in bone. Intersex comparisons were also made. Barium was the only element significantly greater in female blood. Although not statistically different, iron concentrations were also greater in females compared to males. We compared scat collected from different mines with minesâ€™ soil concentrations and found that scat had elevated boron, magnesium, and strontium concentrations. We recommend inset fencing for the four adits at Sheep Tank Mine so bighorn can still rest at the shaded entrance of the mine, but cannot go deep into the mine where increased metal exposures are more likely. We also recommend that future contaminant studies on KNWR bighorn include nutritional analysis so as to fully assess the health of the herd.",
