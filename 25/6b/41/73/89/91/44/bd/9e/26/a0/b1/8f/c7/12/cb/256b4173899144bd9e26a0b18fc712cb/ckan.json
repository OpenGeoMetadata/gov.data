    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Motivation:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The long, successful history of scientific ballooning, coupled with tightening budgets, has led to a surge of interest in the scientific potential of high-altitude balloon flights. Powerful new payloads are being enabled by advancing technologies (e.g. in detectors, high-speed computers, composite materials, etc.), and these experiments will open new discovery spaces for science at a small fraction of the cost of a space mission. Access to much of this discovery space will depend upon the ability to both measure and control instrument pointing to high precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Experiment:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Precision High Altitude Star Tracker (PHAST) is an unpressurized, high-precision, high-bandwidth star tracker for night and day operations aboard scientific ballooncraft. It will enable pointing knowledge using commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, and open-source code development. PHAST will take advantage of advances in detectors and ruggedized computers to design &lt;em&gt;without a pressure vessel&lt;/em&gt;. The low-cost design (&amp;lt;$70k) will be demonstrated and validated on a shared-ride balloon flight. Subsequently, &lt;em&gt;all drawings, design documents and software will be made available to the scientific community,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;upon request, at no cost&lt;/em&gt;, broadening access to this burgeoning field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Significance:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The high performance afforded by this tracker will permit the development of pointing control architectures of reduced complexity and cost due to the elimination of redundant motion transducers such as multiple fiber-optic rate sensing gyros.&amp;nbsp; PHAST will be designed without a pressure vessel, thus significantly reducing launch mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relevance to NASA:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The PHAST development and testing program will advance our understanding of the limits of pointing knowledge for ballooncraft. A timely and successful PHAST program will reduce cost and scientific risk for future balloon-borne missions and will be a &lt;em&gt;fundamentally enabling component&lt;/em&gt; for experiments pushing the envelope of ballooning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.2 Objectives and Expected Significance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By developing a new low-cost star tracker, with high angular precision, fast readout, and the capability of operating in both day and night conditions, we will be providing a new tool that promises cost savings for a wide range of future balloon missions. The capabilities provided by PHAST will be enabling for a number of potential science investigations.&lt;/p&gt;",
