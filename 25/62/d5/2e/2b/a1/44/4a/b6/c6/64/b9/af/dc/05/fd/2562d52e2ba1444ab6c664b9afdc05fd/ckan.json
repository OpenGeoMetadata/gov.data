  "notes": "Purpose: Through Engineering Investigations (EIs), testing, development, evaluation and system integration of Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) in-service catapult components, the Launcher In-Service Workspace supports the fleet by ensuring operational readiness of both existing and newly procured catapult components. Function: The Launcher In-Service Workspace at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ supports its mission by conducting EIs on catapult equipment and inspections and functional testing on new catapult related procurements and catapult circuit cards (i.e., Digital End Speed Indicator (DESI) Master Processor Circuit Board, Capacity Selector Valve (CSV) Controller Circuit Board, Digital Clock Timer (DCT) Timing Board and, in the future, Low Loss Launch Valve Semi-Automatic Lubrication System (LLV SALS)). In addition, the workspace conducts research and development on new projects. Capabilities: This workspace has the ability to replicate the shipboard environment for the CSV, DESI, DCT and LLV SALS. Due to this capability, the Launcher In-Service Workspace is able to test components and conduct EIs locally as opposed to aboard carriers or via travel to land-based catapults. In the past, cost and scheduling have been barriers to the procurement of new equipment and the conducting of EIs for land-based catapults. The Launcher In-Service Workspace provides a cost-efficient solution to these barriers. Furthermore, the workspace is divided up into four areas &amp;ndash; the first area is devoted to CSV; another area is devoted to the DESI, Integrated Catapult Control Station (ICCS) and Jet Blast Deflector (JBD); the third is devoted to LLV SALS, DCT and smaller components such as steam pressure cutoff switches; and the fourth area is dedicated to new projects. The workspace houses most of the steam catapult control and ancillary components seen in a shipboard environment, and some systems are capable of interfacing, allowing for an inter-system integration capability.
