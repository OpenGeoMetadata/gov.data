Some Jewish Synagogues were processed using information found through internet research and locations were determined based upon available sources of ortho imagery (USGS DOQQ's, NAIP, and state and local imagery). These records are indicated by a [CONTHOW] of \"ALT REF\". All data is non license restricted data. The text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 2007/07/20 and the newest record dates from 2007/07/31",
