  "notes": "The CDFW Owned and Operated Lands dataset is a subset of the CDFW Lands dataset. It contains only lands owned (fee title) and some operated (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies and that may be publicly accessible) by CDFW. CDFW Owned and Operated Lands replaces the prior dataset, DFG Owned Lands, which only included fee title lands. Please note that some lands may not be accessible due to the protection of resources and habitat. It is recommended that users contact the appropriate regional office for access information. This is a generalized version of the CDFW Owned and Operated Lands dataset that has a shorter attribute table than the original version and also has been dissolved based on the fields included. The CDFW Lands dataset is a digitized geographical inventory of selected lands owned and/or administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Properties such as ecological reserves, wildlife areas, undesignated lands containing biological resource values, public and fishing access lands, and CDFW fish hatcheries are among those lands included in this inventory. Types of properties owned or administered by CDFW which may not be included in this dataset are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as fishing piers, fish spawning grounds, fish barriers, and other minor parcels. All CDFW properties (mapped herein or not) are assigned a unique Real Property Number (PROP_NBR). A given property may consist of one or more parcels, each identified by a unique Parcel History Number (HIST_NBR). These two identifiers are assigned by the State of California Department of General Services (DGS). Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps relating to that parcel. The approximate parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S. Geological Survey 7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and attributed before being added to the dataset. In some cases, assessor parcel or best available datasets are used to digitize the boundary. Using parcel data to adjust the boundaries is a work in progress and will be incorporated in the future. Township, range, and section lines were based on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' series topographic maps (1:24,000 - scale). In some areas, the boundaries will not align with the Bureau of Land Management's Public Lands Survey System (PLSS).",
