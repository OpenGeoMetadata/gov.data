  "notes": "The objectives of the study summarized in this report are as follows: I. This study was conducted to determine the effects of consumption of halogenated hydrocarbon compounds, primarily polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), contained in Great Lakes fish by the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus). In this article we report the results of feeding White Leghorn hens for a period of 8 wk diets that contained 31-35% ocean fish and/or carp (Cyprinus carpio) from Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, Ml, which provided 0.3 (control), 0.8 (low-dose group), or 6.6 (high-dose group) mg PCB/kg, wet weight (ww). These concentrations were analogous to 3.3, 26, or 59 pg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs)/g diet, ww, respectively. There were no significant effects on feed consumption among the groups. An unexpectedly high incidence of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) was observed in hens from the control (78% FLHS) and low dose (75% FLHS) groups when compared to the high-dose group (15% FLHS). Birds in the control and low-dose groups had a significant increase in liver and body weights. Significant decreases in egg production, weight, and fertility were immediate in all dose groups, with the effect being permanent in the control and low-dose groups. Although the incidence of FLHS was an unexpected complication, the fact that there were no significant effects on egg production, egg weights, or fertility in the high-dose group suggests that the no-observable-adverse-effect concentration (NOAEC) for these parameters is in excess of 26 mg total weathered PCBs/kg egg, ww. This value was the average concentration of PCBs in the high-dose group eggs during the last week of the study. II. Carp from Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, MI, was fed to White Leghorn chickens for a period of 8 wk. The diets contained 0.3 (control; 0% carp), 0.8 (3.4% carp), and 6.6 (35% carp) mg polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)/kg diet, by wet weight (ww). These concentrations corresponded to 3.3, 26, and 59 pg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents/g diet ww, respectively. Though the diets were not acutely toxic to the adult laying hens, dose- and time-dependent responses were observed in the embryos and chicks. Toxicity was manifested as a dose-dependent increase in embryo mortality and decreased hatching rates. Furthermore, embryos and chicks displayed various deformities, including (1) head and neck edema and hemorrhage, (2) abdominal edema and hemorrhage, (3) foot and leg deformities, (4) skull and brain deformities, (5) yolk-sac deformities, and (6) miscellaneous deformities. The types of deformities observed were similar to those reported for embryos and chicks of colonial waterbirds in Saginaw Bay, as well as in controlled studies where technical mixtures or individual congeners of polychlonnated diaromatic hydrocarbons (PCDAHs) were fed to chickens. Increasing concentrations of carp also significantly affected the various organ weights in 18-d embryos and hatched chicks. At 18 d of incubation, weights of the embryos' livers were directly proportional to the concentration of PCBs in the diets. The weights of the spleens and bursae were inversely proportional to the dietary PCB concentration. After 3 additional days of incubation, significant effects in body, brain, liver, heart, and bursa weights were observed in hatched chicks. The concentrations of total PCBs, as well as 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQs) in the diets, were in the range of those that have been shown to cause similar adverse effects in other species. This study has shown that fish, the primary food source of colonial waterbirds in Saginaw Bay, are capable of causing adverse reproductive effects in a model avian species, the chicken. However, due to differences in the relative potency to cause effects on different endpoints in different species, the results of this study should not be used to predict the threshold for effects in other species.",
