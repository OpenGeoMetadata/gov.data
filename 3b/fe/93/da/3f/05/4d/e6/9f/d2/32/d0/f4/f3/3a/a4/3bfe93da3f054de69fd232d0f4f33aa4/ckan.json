  "notes": "This data set contains sensitive biological resource data for Coral Areas of Special Significance (CASS) and Seagrass Areas of Special Significance (SASS) in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Vector points in this data set represent CASS and SASS areas that should be highly prioritized for protection following spills due to various reasons (e.g. species diversity, abundance of soft coral species, high percent cover, sensitive habitat for fish/invertebrates, having structure-building potential that may lead to high diversity/high cover in the future, etc.).This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
