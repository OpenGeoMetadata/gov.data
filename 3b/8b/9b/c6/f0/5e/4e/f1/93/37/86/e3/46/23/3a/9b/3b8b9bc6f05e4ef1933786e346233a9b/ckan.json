  "notes": "\nIn 2016 the following projects will take place to work on understanding and reducing the impacts of land based sources pollution on corals:\n\nInput of Sediments and Nutrients into Cocos Lagoon and Surrounding Areas from the Manell Geus Watershed, Guam: This project will characterize sedimentation and nutrient dynamics in the area of Cocos Lagoon, Guam specifically in the Achang Reef Flat Marine Preserve, and in adjacent coastal areas that receive inputs from the Manell-Geus watershed, a Habitat Focus Area.  Sediments and nutrients are suspected of degrading water quality, particularly in the Achang Preserve.  Adjacent aquaculture facilities may be an additional source of nutrients and perhaps pharmaceuticals (e.g., antibiotics).  Monthly collections of water samples will be analyzed for nutrients; sedimentation would be characterized using sediment traps and pods.  Antibiotics eill be quantified using passive water samplers.\n\nTechnical Support of Inception of FDEP Coral Reef Nutrient Monitoring Program: At the request of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), NOAA NCCOS will provide technical expertise in nutrient monitoring/assessment on the coral reefs of the FL northern one third of the Florida Reef Tract, including sampling design, interlaboratory comparison, and spatial/statistical analysis. At the completion of the project, operations of the monitoring program will fully transition to FDEP.  \n\nEutrophication Impacts on Coral Ecosystem Health in Vatia, American Samoa: Nutrient pollution in Vatia Bay has been hypothesized by jurisdictional managers to be having an adverse effect on the reefs via benthic algal blooms. In 2015, NOAA scientists initiated monitoring in Vatia Bay in order to quantify dynamics in Vatia Bay and establish a baseline against which to compare changes in the benthic algal and coral assemblages in response to nutrient fluxes. Local scientists were trained to continue the water quality sampling on a monthly basis. FY16 funding would be used to continue the monitoring, which is necessary to quantify interannual variability.\n\nOcean Color Product for Monitoring the Threat of Land-Based Sources of Pollution to Coral Reefs: CRW is developing near-real-time tools to provide managers with oceanic turbidity and chlorophyll levels in coastal waters surrounding each USCRTF priority watershed and adjacent coral reefs. The project employs NOAAâs newest operational color algorithm to produce these variables using data from NOAAâs Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. Building on a two-year effort funded by NESDIS/STARâs Ocean Remote Sensing Program and the FY15 joint ORS-/CRCP-funded effort in GuÃ¡nica, we will work closely with local managers in Hawaii and Puerto Rico to develop remote sensing tools for each jurisdiction allowing managers to assess LBSP threats to their coral reefs.\n\nDetermining the efficacy of watershed management in the Wahikuli and Honokowai watersheds, West Maui: Monitoring has documented a 50%â75% decline of coral cover in West Maui (KaâanaplaiâHonolua) watersheds and available data are insufficient to adequately assess recovery potential of these reefs. This project seeks to: 1) Expand year 1 work to assess and report on demographic status of corals for the northern West Maui watershed; 2) share and incorporate results to help ground-truth mapping efforts by CREDâs EcoSpatial Team, and to produce a Maui Priority Watershed Area Status Report; and 3) integrate results into a Final Report on the distribution, status, and condition of the benthic communities in the Priority West Maui Watershed.\n",
