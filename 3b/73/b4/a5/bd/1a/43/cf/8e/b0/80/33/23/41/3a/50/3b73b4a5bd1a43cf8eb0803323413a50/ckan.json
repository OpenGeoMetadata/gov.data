  "notes": "Data set contains 2.5km by 2.5km digital orthophotography mosaics. The digital orthophotos in this series have a nominal ground resolution of 1 meter. The digital orthophoto mosaics are three band, 8-bit GeoTIFFs with pyramids and are color balanced to be uniform while still maintaining as much of the original color and appearance as practical. The source imagery was flown on February 6-7, 2010 with a WILD camera with a focal length of 153.28mm. The film was captured by NOAA at a negative scale of 1\" = 2,500' or a nominal scale of 1:30,000. Aerotriangulation was performed in BINGO as full bundle block adjustments. The project area extends from Big Lagoon to Navaree Beach and includes Pensacola Bay, Escambia Bay, and East Bay; as well as portions of Santa Rosa Sound, and Santa Rosa Island and various small bays and tributaries to the bays.",
