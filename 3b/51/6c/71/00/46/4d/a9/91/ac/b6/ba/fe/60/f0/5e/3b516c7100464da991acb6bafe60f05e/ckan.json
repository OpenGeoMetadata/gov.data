    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "CU Aerospace proposes the ground test validation of a nanosat primary propulsion subsystem using non-toxic propellant with 3-axis ACS for orbit change and/or de-orbit capability, precision maneuvering, and drag makeup. Our approach, called the CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), leverages the existing Micro Propulsion System (MiPS) thruster technology development by our team partner VACCO Industries and enhances it with the CU Aerospace very high efficiency warm gas variant of an innovative resistojet that significantly boosts the performance of standard cold-gas systems. The MiPS system has been tested to 200,000 cycles without any technical issues, demonstrating excellent reliability. The 1.5U CHIPS subsystem, using non-toxic proprietary EP-76 propellant, is a compact thruster system having a total impulse of 602 N-s and a fully throttleable thrust of 50 mN. The subsystem also includes an EP-76 3-axis cold-gas attitude control system.  Approximately 25 W of primary power is required from a battery included in the 1.5U package. The value of this technology is that this low cost subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of nanosat propulsion systems, based upon an innovative warm gas system and propellant, which will become available to the CubeSat and nanosatellite community for a broad range of propulsion needs.",
