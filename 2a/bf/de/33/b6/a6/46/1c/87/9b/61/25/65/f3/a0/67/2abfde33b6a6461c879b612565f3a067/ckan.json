  "notes": "The purpose of the IGDC is to help users find GIS data for the state of Iowa. The site is a cooperative effort between the Iowa Geographic Information Council and local, state, federal and other GIS data producers in Iowa. Users may search by location or topic for available data, many of which have links to where data can be directly downloaded. Data producers are encouraged to register for an account and publish metadata for their GIS data collections so the public can easily find it. The site is maintained by the Iowa State University's GIS Support and Research Facility.",
