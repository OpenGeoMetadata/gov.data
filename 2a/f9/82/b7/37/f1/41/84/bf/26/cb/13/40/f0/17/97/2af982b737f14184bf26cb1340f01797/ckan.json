  "notes": "The Las Vegas Wash is the sole drainage from the Las Vegas Valley watershed to Lake Mead. The four flow components in the Las Vegas Wash are tertiary treated municipal wastewater, urban runoff, shallow ground water, and storm water. Increased urbanization in the valley over the past two decades has resulted in increased flows through the Wash, which has caused significant erosion and wetland destruction. The Las Vegas Wash Monitoring and Characterization Study was initiated as a series of monitoring activities to evaluate whether factors affecting the flow of the Las Vegas Wash might be causing undesired effects on environmental contaminant distribution or accumulation in the Wash and its fish and wildlife inhabitants. The monitoring program is intended to provide a series of snapshots of environmental contaminant levels in the Las Vegas Wash over time through repeated rounds of sampling. In 2003, SNWA and USFWS collected samples of sediment, whole fish, and bird eggs from the Las Vegas Wash and its tributaries, as well as whole fish and bird eggs from Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR), which was used as a regional reference location and analyzed for residues of the selected COPCs. Using the data from “Las Vegas Wash Monitoring and Characterization Study: Ecotoxicologic Screening Assessment of Selected Contaminants of Potential Concern in Sediment, Whole Fish, Bird Eggs, and Water, 2000- 2003” (Intertox 2006), Intertox was asked to summarize and identify levels of concern (LOCs) for contaminant of potential concern (COPCs) found in water, sediment, whole fish, and bird eggs. Intertox was also asked to screen the COPC concentrations to identify high level contaminants, and other spatial trends in contaminant concentrations that might indicate what areas were the main sources of contamination. In 2007, Intertox was asked to compile, summarize, and identify sources of contamination based on the data collected in the monitoring study from 2005 to 2006. After conducting our analysis, the results showed that every sampling location was associated with several COPCs exceeding their LOC for water. At every location where sediments were sampled, at least one COPC (nickel, selenium, or both) exceeded an LOC for sediment. Likewise, at every location where fish and bird eggs were sampled, at least one COPC in at least one sample exceeded the minimum LOC. However, due to a number of possibilities, the relationship between sediment, water, and animal tissue was not always synchronous; nevertheless, the work conducted met the objectives of the study. It is clear that this work is important—to make the studies more robust in the future, we have additional recommendations.",
