  "notes": "The Topological Faces / Military Installation Relationship File (FACESMIL.dbf) contains a record for each face / military installation relationship.  Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB.  A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face.  The face to which a record in the Topological Faces / Military Installation Relationship File (FACESMIL.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to the Topological Faces Shapefile (FACES.shp) on the permanent topological face identifier (TFID) attribute.  The military installation to which a record in the Topological Faces / Military Installation Relationship File (FACESMIL.dbf) applies can be determined by linking to the Military Installation Shapefile (MIL.shp) on the military installation identifier (AREAID) attribute.  A face may be part of multiple military installations.  A military installation may consist of multiple faces.  \r\n",
