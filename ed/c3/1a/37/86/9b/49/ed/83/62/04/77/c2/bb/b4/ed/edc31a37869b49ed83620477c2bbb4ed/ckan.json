  "notes": "Archeologists and physical anthropologists have coordinated their research efforts toward an understanding of the biological population in its cultural setting for many decades. This coordination has taken many forms depending upon the interests and concerns of the physical anthropologistand of the archeologist. Some of these efforts are typological analyses of the skeletal material (Neumann 1952); others are biological tables attached to archeological reports; and others are f u l l y coordinated research such as that done by William Bass in the Plains area (Bass, Evans and Jantz 1971).It is the latter approach that is attempted in this report on the skeletal material from the Scott's Lake Bluff Site (38CR35). The physical anthropology studies are centered around the examination of the relationships between the biological and the cultural development of the population. We have attempted to employ studies of non-metric, discontinuous, and genetic traits along with the cultural forms of treatment of people at death, and the l i f e patterns of these people (Armelagos 1968; Binford 1971; Finnegan1973; Sublett 1972). The study of this relationship calls for an examination and analysis of such features as form and location of burial , relationship of sex and age at time of death, body preparation, articulation, number of individuals per b u r i a l , orientation, position and inclusions i f any (Sprague 1968). Binford (1971) stresses the importance of attempting to confer the\"organizational properties\" of the cultural system under study through the analysis of burial practices as parts of a system with variables affecting them. It is in these areas that we have concentrated our efforts in theanalysis of the Scott's Lake Bluff Site (38CR35).",
