  "notes": "Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) sits at the north end of a large lake called Bear Lake, and is located in southeast Idaho, seven miles southwest of the town of Montpelier. It is in the Bear Lake Valley at an elevation of approximately 5,925 feet. This region of Idaho contains 15 phosphate mines owned by 6 different companies, as well as numerous “orphaned” mine sites primarily of underground design. One of the inactive, underground phosphate mines, Hot Springs Mine, is located on the southeast corner of the Refuge, across from Mud Lake (Figure 1). Two other sites, the Bloomington Canyon Mine, and Paris Canyon Mine are located upstream of two creeks that flow into the Refuge. Concerns developed over the potential movement of contaminants from these sites into the Refuge when investigations at other phosphate mines in the region indicated that elevated concentrations of contaminants, and in particular selenium, were being released into the environment. In addition, the Refuge is heavily influenced by agricultural return flows and acts as a sediment trap for the Bear River, which is often diverted through the Refuge and into Bear Lake, a natural waterbody now often used for irrigation storage and power generation. This study was undertaken to assess the potential risk to fish and wildlife from contaminants associated with mining and agricultural activities within the Bear Lake Refuge drainage. Several matrices were evaluated for contamination, including: water, sediment, plants, invertebrates, fish, and bird eggs. Sampling sites included surface water inflows to and outflows from the refuge, and several locations within Mud Lake (Figure 1). Chemical analyses included scans for inorganics and organochlorine compounds (OCs) to determine whether contaminants associated with both agricultural with its legacy pollutants, and mining activities are accumulating in sediment and biota on the Refuge. The Bear River and its tributaries entering the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge have a designated beneficial use of coldwater aquatic life and salmonid spawning. Most water quality parameters (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.) were within the range of criterion to support aquatic life. Organochlorine concentrations in sediment, plants, fish, and bird eggs did not appear to be at levels harmful to aquatic resources. No OCs were detected in sediment or plant samples, two OCs were detected at low concentrations in fish tissues (p,p’-DDD and p,p’-DDE), and four OCs were detected at low concentrations in eggs (heptachlor epoxide, p,p’-DDE, total PCBs, and trans-nonachlor). Inorganic concentrations were analyzed in sediment, water, invertebrates, fish, and bird eggs. As with organochlorine compounds, bird egg tissue had low levels of inorganics. However, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, and strontium, were elevated in sediments and exceeded guidelines and/or effects thresholds. Concentrations of lead in invertebrates from Paris Creek were within the range known to cause dietary effects to fish, and zinc levels in fish tissue were well above what is considered to be background and exceeded concentrations reported to cause effects in birds.",
