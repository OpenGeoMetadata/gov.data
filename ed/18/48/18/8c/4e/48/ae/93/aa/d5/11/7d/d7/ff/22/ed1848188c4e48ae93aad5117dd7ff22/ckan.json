  "notes": "In the early to mid 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2, funded a number of sewage treatment infrastructure projects. In order to comply with Executive Order 11988, \"Floodplain Management,\" and Executive Order 11900, \"Protection of Wetlands,\" it was determined that EPA would have to ensure that these Federally-funded projects would not lead to degradation or loss of \"Environmentally Sensitive Areas\" (ESAs) (generally wetlands and/or floodplains) due to increased development pressures brought about by the provision of sewage treatment facilities. In order to fund these projects, EPA had to prepare Environmental Assessments (EAs), and make a finding based on the EA that the individual project in question would not have a significant impact on the environment. For projects where it was believed that provision of the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure could lead to impacts to ESAs, a grant condition was utilized, requiring that the connection of any new construction located on a parcel in which ESAs were present that was located within the service area of the Federally-funded infrastructure project receive written approval by the Regional Administrator of Region 2 before being allowed to connect to the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure in question. It is the responsibility of the grant recipient to request these waivers on behalf of project sponsors. This data layer contains the boundaries of areas covered by Environmentally Sensitive Area Grant Conditions as noted in the Environmental Assessments prepared for each project.. While it is possible that the current extent of these areas may have expanded, this layer serves as a general guideline to areas covered by the ESA grant condition. For more information the ESA grant condition, please refer to the following website: http://www.epa.gov/region02/water/sewer.html",
