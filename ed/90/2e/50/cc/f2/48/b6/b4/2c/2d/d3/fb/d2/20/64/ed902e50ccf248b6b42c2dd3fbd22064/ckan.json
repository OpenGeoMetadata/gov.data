These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll\n               highways. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1100 for primary\n               roads. Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway, State Highway,\n               and/or County Highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each\n               direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with\n               many other roads and driveways. They usually have both a local name and a route\n               number. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1200 for secondary\n               roads. ",
