    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key indicator of land surface states, and can provide information on surface-atmosphere heat and mass fluxes, vegetation water stress, and soil moisture. A daily, day and night, LST data set for continental Africa, including Madagascar, was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC; 4 km resolution) data for the 6-year lifetime of the NOAA-14 satellite (from 1995 to 2000) using a modified version of the Global Inventory Mapping and Monitoring System (GIMMS) (Tucker et al., 1994). The data were projected into Albers Equal Area and aggregated to 8 km spatial resolution. The data were cloud-filtered with CLAVR-1 algorithm (Stowe et al., 1999). The LST values were estimated with a split-window technique (Ulivieri et al., 1994) that takes advantage of differential absorption of the thermal infrared signal in bands 4 and 5. The emissivity of the surface was generated using a land cover classification map (Hansen et al., 2000) combined with the FAO soil map of Africa (FAO-UNESCO, 1977) and additional maps of tree, herbaceous, and bare soil percent cover (DeFries et al., 2000). Collateral products include cloud mask, time-of-scan, latitude and longitude, and land/water mask files.The data are in flat binary files. Each data file contains 1152 columns and 1152 rows, in signed integer format (2 bytes), with 8 km by 8 km spatial resolution. A unique map exists for each day and each night of the 6-year NOAA-14 lifetime. The data are best used to infer broad temporal and spatial trends rather than pixel-by-pixel values. ",
