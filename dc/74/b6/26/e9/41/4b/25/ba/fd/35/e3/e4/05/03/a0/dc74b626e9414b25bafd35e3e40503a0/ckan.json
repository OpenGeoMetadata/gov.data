    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set reports continuous high-resolution frequency-domain reflectometry measurements of soil moisture to 10 m depth and precipitation data near each of the two towers located at the km 83 tower site (logged forest site) in the Tapajos National Forest in the state of Para, Brazil. Measurements were made during 2002 and 2003. Soil moisture and precipitation data are provided in two comma-delimited ASCII files.The first tower was installed in an intact forest area at this site in June 2000 (the 'intact' tower) and instrumented for eddy flux and micrometerological measurements and operated 15 months prior to any logging in the area (Goulden et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Rocha et al., 2004). In September 2001, the area adjacent to the tower was selectively logged (Bruno et al., 2006).The second tower (the 'gap tower' tower) was installed and operating in June 2002, 400 m east of the intact tower. The gap tower was installed in the middle of a 50 m x 50 m log landing.Soil moisture measurements were made in 10 m deep vertical pits (1 x 1 m2) approximately 20 m from the micrometerological tower sites in undisturbed forest patches. Reflectometers were inserted horizontally into shaft walls at 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 meters beneath the surface. These data were used to determine how soil moisture varies on diel, seasonal and multi-year timescales and to better understand the quantitative and mechanistic relationships between soil moisture and forest evapotranspiration.",
