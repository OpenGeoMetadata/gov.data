  "notes": "This image represents a 4x4 meter resolution bathymetric surface for Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico (in NAD83 UTM 19 North). The depth values are in meters referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoidal heights. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office and other territory and federal partners, acquired interferometric backscatter and bathymetry data in Puerto Rico from 04/07/2009 to 04/21/2009. Data were acquired with a pole-mounted Teledyne Benthos C3D-LPM interferometric SoNAR (200 kHz) and processed using CARIS HIPS and SIPS v7.0 software. The backscatter data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using the Geocoder module in Hypack 2009. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.",
