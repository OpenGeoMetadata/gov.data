  "notes": "During the 2006 and 2007 field seasons, geologic features indicative of possible youthful surface faulting in or near the Alaska Highway corridor between Delta Junction and Dot Lake were identified by helicopter and fixed-wing air reconnaissance, augmented by interpretation of stereo air photos, remotely sensed images, and aeromagnetic and electromagnetic (EM) datanction to the eastern boundary of the Mt. Hayes Quadrangle. The largest of these faults is the previously unrecognized Dot \"T\" Johnson fault, a major west-trending, south-dipping thrust fault bordering the northern margin of the Alaska Range along the south side of the Tanana River valley. Two other faults identified as active in this study, the Canteen and Granite Mountain-Panoramic faults, are northeast-trending, left-lateral, strike-slip faults that connect segments of the Dot \"T\" Johnson thrust system, where they are separated by large left steps. The Billy Creek fault is a northeast-trending, left-lateral, strike-slip fault in the Yukon-Tanana Upland north of the Tanana River valley.",
