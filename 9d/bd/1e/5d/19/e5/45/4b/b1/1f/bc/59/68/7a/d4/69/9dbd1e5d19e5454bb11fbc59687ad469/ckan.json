    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "EpiSys Science, Inc. and University of Arizona propose to develop, implement, and demonstrate Multi-Function Cognitive Radio Architecture (MF-CRA) for Space Communications, a novel software-defined radio (SDR) architecture that achieves communications configuration autonomy (CCA) with the ability to sense, detect, classify, and adapt to both time-varying communication environment and mission objectives.  The innovations of the proposed MF-CRA system consists of:  (i) meta-cognitive radio engines that learn which Cognitive Engine (CE) is more appropriate to provide the adaptation needed for the application scenario; and (ii) robust, computationally efficient RF sensing, signal detection, and classification algorithms compliant with the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture and specification.   CE is an intelligent agent who observes the radio environment and chooses the best communication settings that best meet the application's goals. We propose a novel concept and design of meta-Cognitive Engine (meta-CE) which has several learning and optimization algorithms in its disposal and is learning which one is more appropriate for the application goals and the radio environment scenarios at the time of operation. To this end, we propose to develop and demonstrate the meta-CE concepts tailored for STRS applications where a meta-CE autonomously manages and controls its STRS radio waveforms and their communication parameters configurations. Our meta-CE features a dynamic RF mapping module, which will sense and record the RF signal levels as a function of the coordinates of the transceivers, the earth's atmospheric conditions, space weather, and trajectory of the transceivers so that it can anticipate the signal changes and seamlessly switch among the available links, waveforms, and parameter configuration settings. Enabling technologies for MF-CRA have been demonstrated through prototype testbed utilizing USRP radios and successful over-the-are tests.",
