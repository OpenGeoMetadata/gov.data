    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As the complexity of flight controllers grows so does the cost associated with verification and validation (V&amp;V). Current-generation controllers are reaching a level of complexity that pushes the envelopes of existing V&amp;V approaches, and without improved approaches there is little hope for affordable V&amp;V of next-generation intelligent systems.  Unfortunately, controller complexity and controller validation are required to ensure the safety of next-generation systems.  Barron Associates proposes an aggressive plan of research to develop monitoring algorithms that estimate, in real time, safety margins of complex systems based on observed differences between the model used for controller development and actual flight data.  The Phase I and Phase II research will focus on the flight test environment where these algorithms would allow the flight test engineer to monitor and revise the test plan in real time - skipping ahead in the buildup when safety is assured and avoiding test points where safety is questionable.  The tool would also recommend test points that could help refine safety margin estimates for as yet unexecuted maneuvers.  The result will be reduced flight test costs and improved safety. Phase I will develop a prototype approach and Phase II would implement the approach in a software tool. ",
