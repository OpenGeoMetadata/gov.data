  "notes": "This table contains water salinity, temperature and sigma t (density) data from 1931 to 1955 binned at 10 meter depth intervals (from 300 meters up to 0 meters) for the Gulf of Maine. It was acquired from the Canadian Fisheries and Oceans Hydrographic database, which covers an area defined by 35 deg - 80 deg N and 42 deg - 100 deg W, and contains over 500,000 temperature-salinity profiles for the Northwest Atlantic from 1910 to the present. The data comes from a variety of sources including hydrographic bottles, CTD casts (either up or down casts), spatially and temporally averaged Batfish tows, and expendable, digital or mechanical bathythermographs. Near real-time data in the form of IGOSS Bathy or Tesac messages are also included. Updates are made monthly.",
