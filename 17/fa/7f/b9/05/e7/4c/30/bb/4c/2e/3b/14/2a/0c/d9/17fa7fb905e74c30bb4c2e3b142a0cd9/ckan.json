    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan  \n                                    satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to\n                                    estimate its associated latent heating.\n                                    \n                                    The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is\n                                    an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures\n                                    the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines\n                                    the layer depth of the precipitation.\n                                    \n                                    The 1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point\n                                    from the Level-0 count value which is linearly proportional to the\n                                    logarithm of the PR receiver output power. To convert the count value\n                                    to the input power, extensive internal calibrations are applied, which\n                                    are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence of\n                                    model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various\n                                    locations of the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are\n                                    measured using an internal calibration loop for the IF unit and later\n                                    receiver stages. To make an absolute calibration, an Active Radar\n                                    Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL and overall system\n                                    gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer\n                                    function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR\n                                    received power is obtained. Note that the value assumes that the\n                                    signal follows the Rayleigh fading, so if the fading characteristics\n                                    of a scatter is different, a small bias error may occur (within 1 or 2\n                                    dB).\n                                    \n                                    The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which\n                                    includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the PR\n                                    measurements.  A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size\n                                    of about 139 MB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS &quot;swath&quot; structure is used\n                                    to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There are 16 files\n                                    each of PR 1B21 and 1C21 data produced per day.\n                                    \n                                    Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South,\n                                    owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit\n                                    provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to\n                                    be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis\n                                    of the diurnal cycle of precipitation. There are, in general, 9150\n                                    scans along the orbit, with each scan consisting of 49 rays.  The scan\n                                    width is about 220 km.",
