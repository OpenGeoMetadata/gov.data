    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Polarimetric radar interferometry (PolInSAR) is a new SAR imaging mode that is rapidly becoming an important technique for bare earth topographic mapping, tree height estimation, and small-scale surface deformation monitoring in vegetated and snow covered regions. Vexcel has developed two processing techniques which may prove to be important for the successful realization of operational PolInSAR systems.  First, primarily ad hoc techniques have been developed for extracting information from PolInSAR data with the result that estimated geophysical parameters have lower accuracy than necessary and associated confidence bounds cannot be computed.  This is unacceptable for both scientific and commercial mapping applications.  We have developed a maximum likelihood inversion formalism which yields the optimal estimates with confidence bounds.  In addition, PolInSAR systems are thought to require extremely accurate calibration, possibly resulting in significant extra expense for antennas with high crosspol isolation, etc.  We have developed a PolInSAR specific calibration algorithm that alleviates these problems, thereby reducing the cost of a PolInSAR system. Phase I concentrates on developing extensions to the basic techniques and theoretically validating their usefulness.  Phase II focuses on experimentally validating the techniques using data from the various PolInSAR systems that will become operational in the next 1-2 years.\r\n",
