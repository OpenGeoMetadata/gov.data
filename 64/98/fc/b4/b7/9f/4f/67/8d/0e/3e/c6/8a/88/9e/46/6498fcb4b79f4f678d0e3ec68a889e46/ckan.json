They represent an automated version of the Minnesota Geological Survey State Map Series Map S-3 (Hydrogeologic Map of Minnesota: Quaternary Hydrogeology), 1979, by Roman Kanivetsky (1:500,000). The Quaternary Hydrogeology file was created by digitizing the the 1:500,000-scale paper map. The 'Quaternary Hydrogeology - Materials' and 'Quaternary Hydrogeology - Yield' layers were then created based on attributes assigned to the file. The Arc coverages were also converted into EPPL 40-acre grid cell files.",
