  "notes": "For this analysis, it was assumed that a relative measure of the risks to communities from wildland fire could be characterized by integrating relative wildland fire risk, relative wildland fire hazard, and wildland urban interface. That is, within the wildland urban interface, risks are directly associated with the probability that an area will burn, as well as the likely fire behavior that would occur if that area did in fact burn. It was assumed that burn probability and likely fire behavior would contribute equally to the risks to communities. Agriculture, rock, urban, and water were not assigned a burn probability or relative fire behavior. Consequently, by definition, communities within these cover classes would not be at risk from wildland fires. For those communities occurring within burnable areas, a communityâs risk to wildland fire could be characterized as follows: CAR = (WUI + Relative WildlandFireRiskstd + Relative WildlandFireHazardstd)/3 Using the three components mentioned above, RelFireRiskCommunities_ID_BLM, \"Relative Risk to Communities from Wildland Fire in Idaho\" was derived.",
