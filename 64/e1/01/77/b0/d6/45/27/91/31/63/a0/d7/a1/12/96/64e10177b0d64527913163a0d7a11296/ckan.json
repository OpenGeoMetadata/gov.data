    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The need to acquire observations on oceanic and atmospheric physical and\nbiogeochemical processes continues to increase. These data are presently\nbeing used as initial conditions for model forecasts, for creating\nclimatological fields, for calibration and validation of remotely sensed\ndata, for model data assimilation, and for flux estimates. Presently,\nautonomous sensor platforms have been designed as low cost expendables\nand are capable of taking measurements of temperature, salinity, wind\nspeed, and bio-optics. Recent advances in the development of in situ\nocean sensors will shortly allow these autonomous sensors to also obtain\nmeasurements of pCO2, nitrate, silicate, ammonium, and iron. However, as\nmore sensors are included on the sensor package, the ability to use them\nas expendables is reduced dramatically. This proposal seeks to\ninvestigate the development and testing of a new low-cost sensor\nplatform that would be capable of retrieval and reuse. The goal would be\nto develop a self-navigating, self-powered platform controlled via\ntwo-way satellite communication. This instrument platform could then be\naugmented with a wide variety of presently available oceanic and\natmospheric sensors.",
