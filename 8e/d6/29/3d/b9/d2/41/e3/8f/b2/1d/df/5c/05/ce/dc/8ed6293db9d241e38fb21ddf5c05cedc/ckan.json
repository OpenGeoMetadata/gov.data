  "notes": "Raw XTF files. Sonar data were collected November 6 to December 15, 2009, in the estuary north from Saugerties to Troy. Data Collection and Processing: The interferometric system used to measure acoustic reflectivity, provided a quantitative measure of reflectivity for every square meter of the survey area. Fugro's system measured and recorded acoustic reflectivity that has a high dynamic range such that the full range of reflectivity's encountered in the estuary environment can be recorded while maintaining a constant gain setting on the system receiver. Reflectivity data from the GeoSwath was used to produce a normalized as well as a classified image of the bottom. Additionally, Fugro provided slope, aspect and hillshade models as additional acoustic parameters. Backscatter data processing was completed with CARIS 7.0. Raw XTF files were created by converting Hypack format (*.HSX) into Triton format (*.XTF) using Hypack 2009a.",
