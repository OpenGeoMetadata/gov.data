    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.  Near real-time (NRT) products are generated within 3 hours of the last observations in the file, by the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) at the AMSR Science Investigator-led Processing System (AMSR SIPS), which is collocated with the Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) DAAC.  The GCOM-W1 AMSR2 Level-2B rain and ocean products include global precipitation and ocean parameters (not including Sea Surface Temperatures), calculated by the Goddard PROFiling algorithm (GPROF) 2010 version using as input the resampled brightness temperature (Level-1R) data provided by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).  Data are stored in HDF-EOS5 format and are available via HTTP from the EOSDIS LANCE system at https://lance.nsstc.nasa.gov/amsr2-science/data/level2/rainocean/.  If data latency is not a primary concern, please consider using science quality products.  Science products are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information.  Science quality products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth's geophysical properties to support science.  The AMSR SIPS plans to start producing initial AMSR2 standard science quality data products in late 2015 and they will be available from the NSIDC DAAC.  Notice: All LANCE AMSR2 data should be used with the understanding that these are preliminary products.  Cross calibration with AMSR-E products has not been performed.  As updates are made to the L1R data set, those changes will be reflected in this higher level product.",
