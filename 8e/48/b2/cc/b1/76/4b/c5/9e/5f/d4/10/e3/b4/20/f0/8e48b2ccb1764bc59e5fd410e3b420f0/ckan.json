  "notes": "North Carolina dam removal mitigation guidelines call for site-specific evaluation of sediment issues, including sediment contamination. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service worked with others to provide necessary data for three North Carolina dams being considered for removal; Lowell Dam (Little River, Johnston County), Carbonton Dam (Deep River, Moore County) and Milburnie Dam (Neuse River, Wake County). We sought to provide answers to these questions for dam owners, regulators, and other stakeholders: 1) Are there historic or existing pollutant sources of concern in the watersheds of the dams? 2) Does sediment pollution exceed guidelines indicating potential adverse impacts to biota? 3) Do pollutant concentrations within the impounded reaches of the dams differ from those downstream, which may be impacted by dam removal? 4) If sediment contaminants exceed screening guidelines, do they cause reductions in survival and growth in test species and/or unacceptable bioaccumulation of pollutants? A tier 1 environmental assessment was completed for each dam to evaluate existing data on contaminant inputs to impounded reaches. At Lowell Dam and Carbonton Dam, tier 2 assessments consisting of sediment chemical analyses were also conducted. Components of the study have been summarized in five previous draft or final reports which should be consulted for detailed methods and study results. Some key findings include the following: We documented low risk of contaminant concerns if the Lowell Dam was removed. Our reports were used in the environmental assessment of the dam removal. The dam was removed by a private entity as a stream mitigation project in 2005. We documented low risk of contaminant concerns if the Carbonton Dam was removed. Our reports were used in the environmental assessment of the dam removal. The dam was removed by a private entity as a stream mitigation project in December 2005. We documented organic and inorganic pollutant concerns in the watershed upstream of Melbourne Dam. If sediment disturbing activities are proposed at the Milburnie Dam, it warrants a tier 2 sediment assessment, with an emphasis on heavy metals and hydrocarbons. A private entity has proposed removal of the dam for stream mitigation. There is no standard method for evaluating potential sediment contamination at dam sites, but the tiered assessment approach we employed worked well. The step-by-step approach of synthesizing existing contaminant source data, sharing that with stakeholders for a discussion on how to proceed, and collecting site-specific sediment data if necessary effectively and efficiently addressed concerns of regulated and regulatory communities. This approach is recommended as a foundation for future dam removal assessments.",
