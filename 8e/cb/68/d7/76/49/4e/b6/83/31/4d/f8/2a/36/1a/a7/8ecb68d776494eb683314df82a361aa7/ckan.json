    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;A total containment NTP exhaust system has been conceptually engineered, however, since this a completely novel approach to address the numerous issues associated with fully containing exhaust from and NTP rocket engine test, to date, no experimental proof-of-concept has been conducted for this innovative technological approach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Therefore, to demonstrate proof-of-concept, this project will develop the preliminary engineering design for a subscale demonstration for a full exhaust containment system.&amp;nbsp; To accomplish this, a closed system of ducts and vessels will be used, and liquid oxygen (LOX) will be injected into the hot hydrogen exhaust to convert it into steam, which will then be condensed and stored as liquid water.&amp;nbsp; Any particulates present, due to sub-optimal engine operation, will either be caught in a particle trap, or end up in water storage vessels, which will store the water indefinitely until fission products either decay, or are filtered, and ultimately can be safely discharged.&amp;nbsp; Gaseous oxygen and any noble gas fission products will then be condensed in a cryogenic heat exchanger and stored in a chilled jacketed Dewar as LOX, and any residual noble gasses, if present, will solidify and can remain stored in the Dewar indefinitely, until the gases have decayed and can safely be released.&amp;nbsp; In this way, all possible fission products that could result from an NTP engine ground test would be captured and stored, and subsequently evaluated and assessed for radioactive contamination and handled accordingly, as needed, over an indefinite period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The components for this system will incorporate additional design elements that are currently in&amp;nbsp;development that will be integrated with the overall design concept. Valuable data collected from these separate design components would then feed into the development cycle of a full scale NTP ground test facility based on outcomes of the subscale concept.&amp;nbsp; The subscale technology demonstrator could ultimately serve as a non-nuclear test bed for NTP ground test facility system components and instrumentation, and would prove to be an invaluable resource for use during the design for a full scale NTP ground test facility.&amp;nbsp; The goal of the project is to better prepare and align NASA SSC for successful participation in developing safe, affordable NTP technologies for future manned space flight travel. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
