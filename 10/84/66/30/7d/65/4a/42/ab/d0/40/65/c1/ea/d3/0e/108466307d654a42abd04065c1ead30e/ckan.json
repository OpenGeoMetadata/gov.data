  "notes": "During recent years there has been a great increase in impoundment of water to improve wildlife habitat particularly for waterfowl and muskrats. Because of continued shrinkage and deterioration of marshes and other wetlands due to encroaching economic development, it appears that many more impoundments will be needed in the future to produce new or better habitat for wildlife. This raises the problem of how to improve wetland habitats for wildlife without creating new mosquito hazards. Experience with large reservoirs and other types of ponds indicates that in most instances, satisfactory environmental, or naturalistic, control of mosquitoes can be worked out. However, this requires research and to date there appears to have been little study on either the extent of mosquito production or its control in impoundments for wildlife. The present study was initiated at the request of the Branch of Wildlife Refuges, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and is part of a long-term cooperative investigation on mosquito breading in impoundments and tidal marshes in New Jersey and Delaware under sponsorship of federal and state agencies., This report covers studies conducted during the summer and fall of 1953 at Bombay Hook Wildlife Refuge, Smyrna, Delaware, by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Delaware Agricultural Experiment Station and through consultation with the Delaware Game and Fish Commission.  The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to determine the mosquito breeding potential of wildlife impoundments in comparison to that of natural tidal marshes, and (2) to devise methods of impoundment construction and of management of water levels and vegetation that will lessennumbers of troublesome mosquitoes.",
