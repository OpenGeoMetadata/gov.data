  "notes": " The Arc Heated Scramjet Test Facility is an arc heated facility which simulates the true enthalpy of flight over the Mach number range of about 4.7 to 8 for free-jet testing of scramjet engines. This tunnel has and does contribute to national security by testing scramjet engines for various hypersonic missiles, launch vehicles, and cruise vehicles. Similar tsets are conducted for commerical launch vehicles, proposed single-stage-to-orbit vehicles, etc. The tunnel also contributes on the economic side by being relatively cheap to operate thus allowing many configurations tobe examined before a model is built for testing in larger facilities where the number of variables that can be examined is smaller because of the increased cost of operation. The tunnel contributes to environmental quality in that the hypersonic engines being tested are typically powered by hydrogen which , when put in use, will drastically reduce emissions since the products of combustion is water. The tunnel benefits all Americans by increasing national security and improving the economics for access to space thus opening up a vast new area for commerical exploitation.  ",
