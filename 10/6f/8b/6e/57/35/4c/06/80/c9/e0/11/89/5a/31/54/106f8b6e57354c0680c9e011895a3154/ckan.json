  "notes": "This draft dataset consists of all ditches or channelized pieces of stream that could be identified using three input datasets; namely the1:24,000 National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and a modified version of the 1:100,000 National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). We used existing attribution from the aforementioned files to identify stream segments that were channelized or ditched. In addition we identified additional stream segments by visually searching for segments that appeared straightened based on professional judgment. This draft data set covers EPA Region 7, or the states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. In most locations the shapefile extends beyond this four state area. This shapefile consists of consolidated channelized and ditched stream segments that were prepared as part of a project titled Developing Synoptic Human Threat Indices for Assessing the Ecological Integrity of Freshwater Ecosystems in EPA Region 7 project. Care should be taken when using this file as the resulting file is an approximation of the channelized or modified streams in EPA Region 7 and some channelized streams are probably missing.",
