      "description": "A detailed gravity survey was carried out for the entire Carson Sink in western Nevada (Figure 1) through a subcontract to Zonge Engineering, Inc. The Carson Sink is a large composite basin containing three known, blind highâ€temperature geothermal systems (Fallon Airbase, Stillwater, and Soda Lake). This area was chosen for a detailed gravity survey in order to characterize the gravity signature of the known geothermal systems and to identify other potential blind systems based on the structural setting indicated by the gravity data.\nData: Data were acquired at approximately 400, 800, and 1600 meter intervals for a total of 1,243 stations. The project location and station location points are presented in Figure 14. The station distribution for this survey was designed to complete regional gravity coverage in the Carson Sink area without duplication of available public and private gravity coverage. Gravity data were acquired using a Scintrex CGâ€5 gravimeter and a LaCoste and Romberg (L&R) Modelâ€G gravimeter. The CGâ€5 gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.001 milligals and a typical repeatability of less than 0.005 milligals. The L&R gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.01 milligals and a typical repeatability of 0.02 milligals. The basic processing of gravimeter readings to calculate through to the Complete Bouguer Anomaly was made using the Gravity and Terrain Correction software version 7.1 for Oasis Montaj by Geosoft LTD.\nResults: The gravity survey of the Carson Sink yielded the following products.\n\nProject location and station location map (Figure 14).\n\nComplete Bouguer Anomaly @ 2.67 gm/cc reduction density.\n\nGravity Complete Bouguer Anomaly at 2.50 g/cc Contour Map (Figure 15).\n\nGravity Horizontal Gradient Magnitude Shaded Color Contour Map.\n\nGravity 1st Vertical Derivative Color Contour Map.\n\nInterpreted Depth to Mesozoic Basement (Figure 16), incorporating drillâ€hole intercept values.\nPreliminary Interpretation of Results:\n\nThe Carson Sink is a complex composite basin with several major depocenters (Figures 15 and 16).\n\nMajor depocenters are present in the southâ€central, eastâ€central, and northeastern parts of the basin.\n\nThe distribution of gravity anomalies suggests a complex pattern of faulting in the subsurface of the basin, with many fault terminations, stepâ€overs, and accommodation zones.\n\nThe pattern of faulting implies that other, previously undiscovered blind geothermal systems are likely in the Carson Sink.\n\nThe gravity survey was completed near the end of this project. Thus, more thorough analysis of the data and potential locations of blind geothermal systems is planned for future work. \n\n- Originated 12/31/2013 by University of Nevada Reno.",

      "description": "Magnetic anomalies are due to variations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by the uneven distribution of magnetic minerals (primarily magnetite) in the rocks that make up the upper part of the Earth's crust. The features and patterns of the magnetic anomalies can be used to delineate details of subsurface geology, including the locations of buried faults and magnetite-bearing rocks and the depth to the base of sedimentary basins. This information is valuable for mineral exploration, geologic mapping, and environmental studies.",
