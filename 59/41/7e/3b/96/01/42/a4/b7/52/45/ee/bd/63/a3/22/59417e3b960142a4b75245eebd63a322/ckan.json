    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Recent advances in ontology development support a rich description of entities that are modeled within a domain and how these entities relate to each other. However, even with ontology information, interoperability of a (sub-) system with other systems remains a serious issue. Interoperability issues may arise when two sub-systems that had not been designed as a unit must now work together. Interoperability issues also arise when extensions to a sub-system result in conflicts with the remainder of the system. In this work, we target (sub-) systems pertinent to advanced life support that are developed using software agent technology. Our innovation is to develop an ontology-aware meta-model to support designers and developers in exposing the information that must be captured in order to achieve the goal of 'designing for interoperability, extensibility, and re-use'. Additionally, the meta-model will be integrated into the agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) design process. Even beyond development of the meta-model and methodology for coupling into the design process, we propose to develop tool support so that the meta-model can be easily utilized within the design process. The success of this innovative meta-model, process, and tool, will support agent-based software re-use and rapid, trouble-free integration of upgraded sub-system components.",
