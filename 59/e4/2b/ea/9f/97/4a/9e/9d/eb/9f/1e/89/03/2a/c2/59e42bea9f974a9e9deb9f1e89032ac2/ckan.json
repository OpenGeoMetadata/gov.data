  "notes": "The purpose of this paper is to assess the issue of anadromous fish passage at Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensed hydropower dams in Michigan and whether contaminants in these anadromous fish pose a significant hazard to wildlife, especially the bald eagle. Existing information developed by the Service, including Great Lakes specific regression analysis of addled egg concentrations and measures of reproductive productivity by us, strongly suggests that eagle reproductive outcomes on the Great Lakes and anadromous fish influenced stream reaches continue to be significantly impaired by at least three organochlorine contaminants; PCBs, DDE and dieldrin. Bald eagle eggs analyzed for contaminant residues exceed concentrations necessary for healthy populations by a few fold to almost three orders of magnitude. Such contamination is consistent with eagles obtaining the majority of egg burdens from Great Lakes fish, according to published data on biomagnification factors from Great Lakes forage fish to colonial waterbird eggs. Certain wildlife species, especially colonial waterbirds and fish-eating or diving ducks, can increase the eagle's contaminant exposure beyond that obtained by preying exclusively on fish. Other species, such as the mink would likely suffer further population declines from fish passage into currently protected upstream reaches. This species is a sensitive ecosystem health indicator for PCBs. Based on the data analysis contained in this white paper, we recommend that the Service seek a position on the FERC licenses which reserves our right to prescribe fish passage until after the following are achieved: (1) contaminants of concern are lowered to acceptable concentrations (No Observable Adverse Effect Concentration in the most sensitive species) in eagle eggs and fish (based on biomagnification factors from fish to eagle egg) used as food for eagles and (2) that measures of bald eagle reproductive success indicating a healthy population be achieved on respective Great Lakes shorelines/existing Great Lakes tributaries influenced by presently contaminated anadromous fish runs. Because the issue affects several Service program responsibilities, significant coordination between our Federal Aid, Fisheries, Endangered Species, Contaminants, and the Enhancement programs is necessary to assure a uniform position and assignment of appropriate responsibilities relative to anadromous fish assessments and operational initiatives.",
