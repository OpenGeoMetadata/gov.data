  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Carrier Analysis Lab (CAL) - Aircraft/Weapons/Ship Compatibility Lab located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ provides technical, engineering and programmatic capabilities to support and develop fully compatible aircraft, ship and weapons systems. Additionally, the CAL is the only capability outside of on-the-job-training to provide Aircraft Handling Officers with familiarity and informal training on operational deckflow efficiencies.  Function:  The CAL at Lakehurst uses a variety of hardware and software tools that aid in the assessment and measurement of operability, supportability, mission capability and readiness of deployed aircraft operating from aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, air capable surface combatants and emerging systems in the conceptual stage of development. The CAL also uses these tools in the lab&amp;#39;s assessment of Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) systems&amp;#39; configuration and performance requirements with regard to flight deck design, aircraft size/geometry and deck handling characteristics.  Capabilities:  The CAL team is the Technical Warrant Holder (TWH) for shipboard deck cycle performance, airplan execution analysis, aircraft turnaround time analysis and Sortie Generation Rate (SGR) analysis. Often, CAL personnel will call upon the assistance of Fleet Process Teams to simulate at-sea operational scenarios which allow the assessment of newly introduced aircraft weapons systems, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) or Air Combat Element (ACE) complement changes and ship installed equipment changes to the ship environment. Such simulations are accomplished through the use of computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools and Quija board-like tables which feature scaled air vehicles/support equipment templates as well as an autonomous template tracking system that automatically documents the location and orientation of items on representative flight and main decks. The CAL has also developed, and maintains, the Seabasing Aviation Model (SAM) - a model which provides insight into capabilities and support requirements of sea-based aviation operations, particularly as they relate to embarked landing forces.
