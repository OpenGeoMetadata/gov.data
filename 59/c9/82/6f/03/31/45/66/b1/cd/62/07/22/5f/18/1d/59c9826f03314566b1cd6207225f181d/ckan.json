  "notes": "The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) collects aerial photography of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) floodplain on a regular basis. These data are used to support the Center's long-term goals of understanding the UMRS and developing useful products for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP). During May 1999, 1:15,000-scale true color aerial photos were collected within Pool 8 during high water conditions for an LTRMP project. The photos were collected using a 60% stereo overlap between photos in the same flight line and a 30% overlap between flight lines. Approximately every other photo was scanned, georeferenced, and compiled into the mosaic. The mosaic was then compressed into a .sid image file so it would be easier to download. Note: While the photos have been georeferenced, they were not orthorectified.",
