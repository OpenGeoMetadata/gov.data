    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Pioneer Astronautics proposes an advanced photocatalytic oxidation reactor for enhancing the reliability and performance of Water Recovery Post Processing systems aboard crewed spacecraft.  This novel technology, called the Advanced Wastewater Photooxidation System (AWPS) is designed to oxidize and remove recalcitrant aqueous organic constituents in the water recovery post processing system under ambient temperature and pressure conditions.   The basis of the innovation is the combination of high brightness and long lifetime UV LED light sources with efficient geometric illumination of a highly active photocatalyst immobilized on a high surface area support.  This combined approach leads to numerous performance benefits including high conversion efficiency, low temperature and pressure operation, compact footprint, high reliability and low crew maintenance, and decreased equivalent system mass (ESM).   The Phase I effort will clearly demonstrate the feasibility of these concepts by mineralization of polar water soluble organics and organosilanol constituents under long duration testing.  Data from the Phase I will lead to a prototype scale-up of the device in Phase II.   Development strategies for the Phase II device include component design verification testing and determining optimum reaction conditions.   Long duration performance tests will validate the reactor design, and establish the technology applications in space and commercial markets.",
