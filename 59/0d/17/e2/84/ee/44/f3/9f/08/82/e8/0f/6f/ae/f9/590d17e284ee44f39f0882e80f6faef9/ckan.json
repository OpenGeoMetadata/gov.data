The coverage was developed from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database for Iowa. There were many errors in the original GNIS data, including missing points or mislocated points. The GNIS points were compared to two reference sources: USGS 100k scale county maps and Iowa DOT county highway maps. Mislocated and missing point were fixed and each town was designated as having been verified from one or the other reference sources or both. Some GNIS points were not verified from either source and are so designated (use these with caution).",

Similarly the Department assumes no responsibility for the consequences of inappropriate uses or interpretations of the data made by anyone to whom this data has been made available.  The Department bears no responsibility to inform users of any changes made to this data.  Anyone using this data is advised that precision implied by the coverage may far exceed actual precision.  Comments on this data are invited and the Department would appreciate that documented errors be brought to staff attention.  The development of the coverages in the NRGIS Library represents a major investment of staff time and effort.  As a professional responsibility, we expect that the Iowa DNR will receive proper credit when you utilize these GIS coverages and that the original documentation will remain with any redistribution of these coverages.\"]"
