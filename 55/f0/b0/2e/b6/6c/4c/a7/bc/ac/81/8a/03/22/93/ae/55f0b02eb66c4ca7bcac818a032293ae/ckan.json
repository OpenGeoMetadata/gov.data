    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Applied Technology Associates (ATA) proposes to develop a new inertial sensor by combining two sensing phenomena in a single device.  ATA has patented an advanced inertial sensing technology based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).  Numerous researchers have patented and developed micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) that measures inertial angular motions.  We believe that a composite sensor based on the best characteristics of both of these technologies is a promising new advancement.  Our innovation is denoted the Hybrid Sensor (HYSENS) owing to its origins in two distinct inertial angle rate sensing principles.   The MHD technology offers wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, with reasonable size and power.  The MEMS offers small size and power.   Initial analysis done by ATA and our MEMS technology partners indicates that it is possible to achieve performance goals that are at or near the state-of-the-art for inertial reference sensors.  The proposed composite sensor fulfills the need for lightweight, compact, high-precision, high-bandwidth (0-2KHz) inertial reference sensors for use onboard spacecraft with optical communications payloads.  The predicted noise performance for HYSENS is less than 0.1 microrad.  Volume for this advanced sensor is expected to be under 2 cubic in; its weight under 150 grams; and its power draw under 200 mW.",
