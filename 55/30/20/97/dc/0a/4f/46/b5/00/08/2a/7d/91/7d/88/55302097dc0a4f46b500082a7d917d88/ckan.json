  "notes": "Sediment quality was assessed in 1992 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at six backwater sites along the Upper Mississippi River. Five of the backwater sites were in Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge. The Sediment Quality Triad approach was attempted to evaluate heavy metal and nutrient contamination. The Sediment Quality Triad methods included analytical chemistry, benthos assessment and toxicity testing using the Microtox (R) system. Heavy metal concentrations were within or slightly elevated above background limits. Nutrient concentrations were slightly to very elevated. The reference site for the study area was at Skunk Slough in Pool 19. Skunk Slough had abundant infaunal macroinvertebrates with above average heavy metal concentrations and low ammonia concentrations. Keithsburg Division in Pool 18 was identified as a backwater with contaminant problems. Keithsburg Division had a poor assemblage of infaunal macroinvertebrates with above average heavy metal concentrations and the highest concentrations of ammonia for the study area. Ammonia toxicity was the suspected cause of some mortality in sediment elutriate toxicity tests completed at Keithsburg Division. The elutriate toxicity tests were intended to validate the Microtox (R) tests. The Microtox (R) test results were not used because they did not relate to the benthos diversity and chemistry data. GIS analysis indicated that the contaminant problems at the Keithsburg Division backwater were not related to point source pollution such as wastewater discharges into adjacent rivers. The results from this project were used to initiate a multi-year study on nonpoint source pollution at Keithsburg Division.",
