    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The first major objective of the &amp;lsquo;Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) for Space Applications&amp;rsquo; project is to raise the technology readiness level dry lubricated, cryogenic BMG gearboxes (currently TRL 3) to TRL 6 &amp;nbsp;where they will be viable for infusion into a technology demonstration mission or flight project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second major objective is to develop an industrial supply chain for BMG and BMG composite alloys in a variety of form-factors (e.g. powder (shot) and sheet) for infusion into NASA, military, commercial, and multi-use applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third major objective is to demonstrate use of these new alloys and form-factors in the fabrication of components for NASA applications for further infusion of BMGs and BMG composites into NASA missions. While initial prototyping will likely be done internally at NASA, this third objective includes technology transfer to industry to develop manufacturing sources for all NASA centers, other governmental bodies, and commercial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific objectives include: 1. Develop a gearbox using amorphous metal alloys that can operate at extreme environmental ranges (-130&amp;deg;C to +125&amp;deg;C) without heaters and demonstrate properties and performance equivalent to the current state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Develop the capability for fabrication of amorphous metal sheet and powder with the appropriate external partner or partners to enable a wide range of amorphous metal products including, but not limited to, MMOD shielding and gearbox components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Develop additional BMG and BMG composite alloys, identify infusion paths for these (and existing) amorphous metals, and select at least two demonstration applications (e.g. high-quality, precision optics) for powder (shot) and sheet of the appropriate alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Compare the properties of laboratory and commercially produced BMGs and BMG composites as a precursor to the development of standards and specifications for these new alloys.&lt;/p&gt;",
