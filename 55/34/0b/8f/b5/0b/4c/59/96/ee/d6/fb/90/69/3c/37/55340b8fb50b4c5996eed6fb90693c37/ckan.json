An edge can\n               have several feature names; an address range located on an edge can be associated\n               with one or any combination of the available feature names (an address range can be\n               linked to multiple feature names). The address range is identified by the address\n               range identifier (ARID) attribute that can be used to link to the Address Ranges\n               Relationship File (ADDR.dbf). The linear feature name is identified by the linear\n               feature identifier (LINEARID) attribute that can be used to link to the Feature Names\n               Relationship File (FEATNAMES.dbf).",
