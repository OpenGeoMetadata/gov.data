  "notes": "The nesting population of greater sandhill cranes on Malheur  National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon had declined from 236 pairs in  1971 to 181 pairs in 1986 when predator control began. The population has continued to decline to 168 pairs in 1989. Some of the decline is attributed to lost habitat on Mud, Malheur and  Barney Lakes due to record high lake levels (14 pairs). Losses on Mud, Malheur, and Harney lakes had already taken place by 1986 but could not be verified until a comprehensive pair count was done in 1988. The remainder of the decline is attributed to the low recruitment of young into the population during the years 1971 through 1985. In 1990, a total of 177 crane pairs were counted on the refuge. This represents the first increase documented for the refuge crane population since 1972. We believe the increase is a direct result of the predator control program. Cranes produced during the first couple of years of the control effort became old enough to breed. In comparison to 1989, twenty-two additional active territories were identified this year. Eight of these sites were inactive in 1989 but had been active in previous years. Fourteen territories which had been active in 1989 were inactive this year. These losses and gains in territory activity can be attributed to shifting or territory sites, pair mortality, and pair recruitment. At least nine new pairs began nesting in 1990. In 1990, 156 coyotes were removed by the following methods: aerial gunning (8 percent), calling and shooting (28 percent), trapping and snares (44 percent), and denning (18 percent). An estimated 35 ravens were removed using 35 dozen eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional 8 ravens were shot. Nine raccoons were taken by trapping plus ten by shooting, for a total of 19. Sandhill cranes experienced a fair production year in 1990. Overall sandhill crane hatching success was 83% in 1990. This exceeds our control program goal of 75%, and is the highest nesting success ever recorded for the Malheur crane flock. Predators took only 8% of the nests this year (raven - 3%, raccoon -3%, coyote - 0%, and unidentified predators - 2%). Crane colts were counted on 7 September in the Double-O and Blitzen Valley using ADC's supercub aircraft. This aerial data was supplemented with ground counts in the Blitzen Valley. A total of 22 colts were counted on the refuge in September 1990. During a visit to the Double-O in mid March 1991, biologist Ivey observed six colts accompanied by parents. Only two colts were counted from this area during the September survey. Therefore, at least 26 colts were produced in 1990. This should be considered a minimum number, since dry conditions and poor grain crops forced many cranes to migrate south before the September counts were completed.",
