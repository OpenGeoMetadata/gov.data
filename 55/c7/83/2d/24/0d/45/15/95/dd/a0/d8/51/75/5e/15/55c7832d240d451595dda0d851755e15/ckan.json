    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The energy generation and storage for modern-day sensor networks, communications, and electronics presents a variety of unique challenges.  To achieve the long-duration missions away from Earth as outlined in the Vision for Human Exploration in Space, these energy storage systems will need to undergo a dramatic increase in their specific energy densities.  Recently, Mainstream has made startling advances in the area of high energy-density batteries using carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes.  However, theory suggests that silicon actually possesses an intercalation capacity that is an order of magnitude above that of carbon.  If this is able to be translated into added capacity, it would truly revolutionize Li-ion electrochemistry and energy-storage technologies in general.  The Universities Space Research Association has recently developed a process of growing silicon nanorods and has agreed to team with Mainstream for this Phase I STTR effort.  This Phase I focuses on developing and testing electrodes comprised of both silicon and carbon nanostructures in Li-ion batteries.  Because the basic battery chemistry will not be affected, safety will not be compromised.",
