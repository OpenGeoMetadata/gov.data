    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "SSCI proposes to develop, implement and test a collision detection system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), referred to as the Asynchronous Sensor fuSion for Improved Safety of air Traffic (ASSIST). The ASSIST system is robust to ADS-B spoofing, and will associate the EO/IR and airborne radar (ABR) tracks generated onboard the UAV with those generated by the ground-based radar (GBR) to  minimize false tracks generated by EO/ABR due to clutter. Under this project, we plan to leverage our FORECAST technology (Fast On-line pREdiCtion of Aircraft State Trajectories) that fuses the ground-based radar information with airborne radar and transponder data to achieve accurate track generation and efficient prediction of potential NMACs in a high-density airspace. We will also leverage our SAFESEE (Sense and Avoid using Fusion and Expansion SEgmEntation) technology - a collision detection system that uses pixel-level fusion of EO/IR optical-flow features to achieve robust probability of detection and low FAR under realistic operating conditions. SAFESEE has been recently flight tested at the Air Force Bombing Range at Avon Park, FL. Under our FORECAST project we developed a capability of simulating communication delay between the ground station and the UAV. We plan to extend this capability and carry out a study of effects of the communication delay on the ASSIST system. Specific Phase I tasks include:  (i) Acquire target tracks and FAR related to existing capabilities from NASA; (ii) Develop, implement and test the ASSIST system; and (iii) Carry out a trade study of the effect of the communication delay on the ASSIST system. In Phase II we plan to carry out extensive  analysis and simulation testing of the ASSIST system, and arrive at a flight testing plan for the continuation of the work beyond Phase II.",
