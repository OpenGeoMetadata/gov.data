    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR will adapt and demonstrate a low cost flexible method of manufacturing channel wall liquid rocket nozzles and combustors, while providing developers a means to manufacture more complex designs for improved engine performance.\r\nCurrent channel wall engine concepts are limited by capabilities of available manufacturing methods.  This SBIR will provide a cold, non-chemical, low load alternative while supporting more complex liner designs.  It will enable features such as cooling channels with complex patterns, bifurcations, flow trips, varying width and depth, thin hot walls, negative wall taper, more accurately placed channel walls and more complex liner contours.\r\nOrmond will work together with contacts at NASA and Aerojet Rocketdyne during Phase I to provide demonstration coupons of current engine concepts and to identify additional design options that can be incorporated through use of the proposed technology.  Cost and technical feasibility will be demonstrated.\r\nA Phase II program will result in a TRL-6 level means of machining channel combustor and nozzle liners.  Scalability to SSME class of engines will be addressed.  \r\nGovernment and commercial applications that may benefit from the proposed technology development include channel wall liquid rocket engines, ground based turbine generators, advanced turbine blades, scramjets, space optics, and down-hole oil well tooling.",
