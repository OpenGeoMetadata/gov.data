    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is a clear and well-identified need for rapid, efficient,\nnon-destructive detection and isolation of radiation damaged cells.\nAvailable commercial technologies are expensive, require core facilities\nand use destructive methods. We propose to develop and demonstrate a\nnovel fully automated, microfluidics-based device for identification and\nsorting of radiation damaged cells.  The final product will be simple,\nsmall, inexpensive and fieldable in research environments as well as\nspace. We will identify novel cell surface markers indicating radiation\ndamage using a microarray (gene expression) experiments and verify\ndownselected markers (protein upregulation) using fluorescent antibody\ntagged microparticles. CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoretic cell sorter\ntechnology will be adapted for automated separation of the tagged\ndamaged cells from overall population of cells. Proof-of-concept will be\ndemonstrated by separation of damaged cells from an irradiated cell\nsample. Phase II efforts will focus along two primary lines. Surface\nbiomarkers discovery will be further extended and validated. An\nintegrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of all\noperations (storage, mixing, sorting) will be developed.  The prototype\ninstrument will be demonstrated with both terrestrial and space\nradiation (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities). A\nmulti-disciplinary team consisting of experts in microfluidics engineers\n(CFDRC) and radiation biologists (Temple University) has been assembled.",
