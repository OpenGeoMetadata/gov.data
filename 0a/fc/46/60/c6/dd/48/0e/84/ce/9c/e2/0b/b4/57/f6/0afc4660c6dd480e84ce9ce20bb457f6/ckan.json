    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the mean diurnal cycle of precipitation, near-surface thermodynamics, and surface fluxes generated from short-term forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model.The model outputs were 12- to 36-hour short-range forecasts, run at a triangular truncation of T319 and a vertical resolution of 60 levels, from each daily 1200 (UTC) analysis. The version of the forecast model used to prepare this data product was the operational ECMWF model in fall 2000, which included the tiled land-surface scheme (TESSEL) (Van den Hurk et al., 2000) and recent revisions to the convection, radiation, and cloud schemes described by Gregory et al., (2000). The ECMWF model was run for two Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) campaigns conducted in Rondonia, Brazil, during January and February of 1999: the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). See Silva Dias et al.,(2002) for additional information regarding the WETAMAC and TRMM campaigns. There are two comma-delimited data files with this data set: the ECMWF model output data and a file containing the mean hourly precipitation observations used to check the model output for biases.",
