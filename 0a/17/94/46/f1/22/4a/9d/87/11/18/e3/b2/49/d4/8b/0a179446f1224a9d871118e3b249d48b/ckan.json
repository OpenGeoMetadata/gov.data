    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;FAAST is an R/C helicopter platform that is being developed by the Aeroscience and Flight Mechanics Division (EG) as a low-cost, low-risk, hands-on way for engineers to test autonomous and automated (A&amp;amp;A) system architectures, algorithms, and sensors.&amp;nbsp; It is also envisioned as a platform for building trust in A&amp;amp;A systems among key stakeholders such as program/project management, crew members, and operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust is the greatest obstacle to implementing greater autonomy and automation (A&amp;amp;A) in the human spaceflight program. The Future Autonomous and Automated Systems Testbed (FAAST) is an R/C helicopter-based system being developed by the Aeroscience and Flight Mechanics Division (EG) as a low-cost, low-risk, hands-on way for customers (program management, crew, and operators) to become familiar with and build trust in A&amp;amp;A systems, and as a platform for engineers to quickly and cheaply test A&amp;amp;A architectures and algorithms.&amp;nbsp; An early goal of this project is the development of an autonomous GN&amp;amp;C system, a key component of which is access to suitable sensor hardware. In this project we requested funds to procure navigation sensors (e.g. MEMS IMU, GPS receiver, LIDAR, etc.) in support of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We researched and procured navigation sensors (e.g. MEMS IMU, GPS receiver, LIDAR, etc.) and integrated them into the helicopter platform, with the objective of performance suitable for autonomous waypoint navigation. The intended product of this activity is the development of a prototype navigation system that will form the navigation backbone of FAAST. Upon completion of this project&amp;#39;s work, FAAST will have a functioning navigation system suitable for enabling future A&amp;amp;A research objectives, including autonomous rendezvous and docking, and autonomous take-off and landing.&lt;/p&gt;",
