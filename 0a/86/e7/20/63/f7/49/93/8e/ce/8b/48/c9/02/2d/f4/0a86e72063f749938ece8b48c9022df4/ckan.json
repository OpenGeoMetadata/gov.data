The format of this data is a grid with each cell covering 0.5 meter by 0.5 meter. The elevation value (North American Vertical Datum, NAVD88) represented by each cell is the most probable elevation for that cell based on calculated Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) as calculated in Caris HIPS and SIPS software. Calculated TPS values are then used by Caris to create a Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE) surface. The surface grid was used to export the cell centroid position (Northing, Easting in UTM zone 14 North, in meters) along with the cell elevation (referenced to NAVD88, in meters) to create the text file. The data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD).",
