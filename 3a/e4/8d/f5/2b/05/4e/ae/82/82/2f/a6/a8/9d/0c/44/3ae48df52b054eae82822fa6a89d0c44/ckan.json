  "notes": "Map Information:\n\nThis nowCOAST time-enabled map service provides maps depicting NWS gridded forecasts of the following selected sensible surface weather variables or elements: air temperature (including daily maximum and minimum), apparent air temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, wind speed, wind gust, total sky cover, and significant wave height for the next 6-7 days. Additional forecast maps are available for 6-hr quantitative precipitation (QPF), 6-hr quantitative snowfall, and 12-hr probability of precipitation. These NWS forecasts are from the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) at a 2.5 km horizontal spatial resolution. Surface is defined as 10 m (33 feet) above ground level (AGL) for wind variables and 2 m (5.5 ft) AGL for air temperature, dew point temperature, and relative humidity variables. The forecasts extend out to 7 days from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day). The forecasts are updated in the nowCOAST map service four times per day.   For more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the    nowCOAST Dataset Update Schedule.\n\nThe forecast projection availability times listed below are generally accurate, however forecast interval and forecast horizon vary by region and variable. For the most up-to-date information, please see  http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ndfd/resources/NDFD_element_status.pdf and  http://graphical.weather.gov/docs/datamanagement.php.\n\nThe forecasts of the air, apparent, and dew point temperatures are displayed using different colors at 2 degree Fahrenheit increments from -30 to 130 degrees F in order to use the same color legend throughout the year for the United States. This is the same color scale used for displaying the NDFD maximum and minimum air temperature forecasts. Air and dew point temperature forecasts are available every hour out to +36 hours from forecast issuance time, at 3-hour intervals from +36 to +72 hours, and at 6-hour intervals from +72 to +168 hours (7 days). Maximum and minimum air temperature forecasts are each available every 24 hours out to +168 hours (7 days) from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day).\n\nThe relative humidity (RH) forecasts are depicted using different colors for every 5-percent interval. The increment and color scale used to display the RH forecasts were developed to highlight NWS local fire weather watch/red flag warning RH criteria at the low end (e.g. 15, 25, & 35% thresholds) and important high end RH thresholds for other users (e.g. agricultural producers) such as 95%. The RH forecasts are available every hour out to +36 hours from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day), at 3-hour intervals from +36 to +72 hours, and at 6-hour intervals from +72 to +168 hours (7 days).\n\nThe 6-hr total precipitation amount forecasts or QPFs are symbolized using different colors at 0.01, 0.10, and 0.25 inches, at 1/4 inch intervals up to 4.0 (e.g. 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, etc.), at 1-inch intervals from 4 to 10 inches and then at 2-inch intervals up to 14+ inches. The increments from 0.01 to 1.00 or 2.00 inches are similar to what are used on NCEP/Weather Prediction Center's QPF products and the NWS River Forecast Center (RFC) daily precipitation analysis. Precipitation forecasts are available for each 6-hour period out to +72 hours (3 days) from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day).\n\nThe 6-hr total snowfall amount forecasts are depicted using different colors at 1-inch intervals for snowfall greater than 0.01 inches. Snowfall forecasts are available for each 6-hour period out to +48 hours (2 days) from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day).\n\nThe 12-hr probability of precipitation (PoP) forecasts are displayed for probabilities over 10 percent using different colors at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 85+ percent. The probability of precipitation forecasts are available for each 12-hour period out to +72 hours (3 days) from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day).\n\nThe wind speed and wind gust forecasts are depicted using different colors at 5 knot increments up to 115 knots. The legend includes tick marks for both knots and miles per hour. The same color scale is used for displaying the RTMA surface wind speed forecasts. The wind velocity is depicted by curved wind barbs along streamlines. The direction of the wind is indicated with an arrowhead on the wind barb. The flags on the wind barb are the standard meteorological convention in units of knots. The wind speed and wind velocity forecasts are available hourly out to +36 hours from 00:00 UTC on Day 1 (current day), at 3-hour intervals out to +72 hours, and at 6-hour intervals from +72 to +168 hours (7 days). The wind gust forecasts are available hourly out to +36 hours from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day) and at 3-hour intervals out to +72 hours (3 days).\n\nThe total sky cover forecasts are displayed using progressively darker shades of gray for 10, 30, 60, and 80+ percentage values. Sky cover values under 10 percent are shown as transparent. The sky cover forecasts are available for each hour out to +36 hours from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day), every 3 hours from +36 to +72 hours, and every 6 hours from +72 to +168 hours (7 days).\n\nThe significant wave height forecasts are symbolized with different colors at 1-foot intervals up to 20 feet and at 5-foot intervals from 20 feet to 35+ feet. The significant wave height forecasts are available for each hour out to +36 hours from 0000 UTC on Day 1 (current day), every 3 hours from +36 to +72 hours, and every 6 hours from +72 to +144 hours (6 days).\n\n\nThis map service is time-enabled, meaning that each individual layer contains time-varying data and can be utilized by clients capable of making map requests that include a time component.\n\nIn addition to ArcGIS Server REST access, time-enabled OGC WMS 1.3.0 access is also provided by this service.\n\nThis particular service can be queried with or without the use of a time component. If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery most relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time parameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for the present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter is not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no data will be returned.\n\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service will always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified time value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and 12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the data valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more flexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers together despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\n\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous time value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is specified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are given), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\n\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls within the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is frequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically determine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the time extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does not always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data. Instead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the service:\n\n    1.  Issue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only) for an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return the current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format (milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on the \"Return Updates\" link at the bottom of the REST Service page under \"Supported Operations\". Refer to the ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation for more information.\n\n    2.  Issue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against the proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster data, this would be the \"Image Footprints with Time Attributes\" layer in the same group as the target \"Image\" layer being displayed. For vector (point, line, or polygon) data, the target layer can be queried directly. In either case, the attributes returned for the matching raster(s) or vector feature(s) will include the following:\n\n        validtime: Valid timestamp.\n        starttime: Display start time.\n        endtime: Display end time.\n        reftime: Reference time (sometimes referred to as issuance time, cycle time, or initialization time).\n        projmins: Number of minutes from reference time to valid time.\n        desigreftime: Designated reference time; used as a common reference time for all items when individual reference times do not match.\n        desigprojmins: Number of minutes from designated reference time to valid time.\n\n    3.  Query the nowCOAST LayerInfo web service, which has been created to provide additional information about each data layer in a service, including a list of all available \"time stops\" (i.e. \"valid times\"), individual timestamps, or the valid time of a layer's latest available data (i.e. \"Product Time\"). For more information about the LayerInfo web service, including examples of various types of requests, refer to the nowCOAST LayerInfo Help Documentation.\n",
