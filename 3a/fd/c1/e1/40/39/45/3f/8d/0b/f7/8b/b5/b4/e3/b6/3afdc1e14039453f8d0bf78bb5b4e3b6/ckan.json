    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set consists of time-series spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery of the three Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) Meso-cell Study Areas (MSAs) (Fraser, Rabbit Ears, and North Park) acquired by the RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Images are derived from C-band (5.3 GHz frequency, 5.66 cm wavelength) HH-polarization Standard Beam data for multiple incidence angles. SAR data were acquired through the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and post-processed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, for derivation of ancillary data and assembly of the database. The data series consists of 195 individual radar scenes acquired from 17 February to 23 June 2003. Calibrated radar backscatter images are provided in binary format together with header and facility data record information for each image. \n\nNote that the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) holds copyrights over all RADARSAT-1 SAR data. NASA/NOAA-approved SAR researchers are can obtain these data directly from ASF, as per agreements between NASA/NOAA and CSA. No commercial use is allowed of the data or any products derived there from. Users of this data must submit a <A HREF='/data/docs/daac/nsidc0146_clpx_radarsat/ASF_Res_Agreement.doc'>Research Agreement</A> to ASF.\n\n\nThe NASA CLPX is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage, and transformations to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging from 1-ha to 160,000 km2, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations are collected. Data collection focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions are generally frozen and dry, and early spring, a transitional period when both frozen and thawed, dry and wet conditions are widespread.",
