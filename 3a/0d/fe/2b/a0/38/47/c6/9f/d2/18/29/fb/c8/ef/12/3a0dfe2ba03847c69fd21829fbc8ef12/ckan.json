    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Composites offer unique advantages for aerospace structures and are increasingly being adopted into newer designs. However, it is also acknowledged that given current understanding of damage mechanisms in composites there is a significant risk with the extensive use of composites materials in aerospace applications. On one hand the uncertainty in damage evolution along lifetime is extremely large, and on the other hand there is a lack of knowledge about the mechanics of the onset, posterior growth, and interactions between several micro-scale damage modes. All these factors lead to the adoption of high safety margins in the design and costly inspection schedules along the service to mitigate the risks. Structural health monitoring for onboard damage diagnosis and prognosis of structural failures has the potential to reduce maintenance costs and improve the safety of the structure through a condition based maintenance scheduling. In this scheme the current damage state of a specific structural element is estimated and further used as the input for a prognostic algorithm that predicts the propagation of damage through time using updated models and based on some knowledge of the future load conditions.\r\n\r\nA novel damage prognostics framework for composites FRP under fatigue loadings is proposed in this work. The proposed methodology is grounded on physics-based models for evolution of damage at (1) micro-scale, i.e. micro-cracks and delamination, and (2) macro-scale such as stiffness reduction induced by micro-scale damage modes. Through stochastic embedding, these apriori deterministic models are converted to probabilistic models by introducing a modeling error term. This error term is controlled by a probability density function whose parameters are estimated in addition to the rest of \"physical\" parameters. The probabilistic damage models  are then incorporated in a Bayesian filtering algorithm that sequentially updates both, a damage state variable and the set of model parameters, as fresh damage data become available along the fatigue cycling process. Next, these damage models are used to simulate fault propagation with this updated state information to generate a prognostic estimate of the remaining useful life of the structure in a probabilistic sense. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using experimental NDE damage data for micro-crack density, delamination area, and stiffness reduction from an extensive post-impact tension-tension fatigue test performed over several CFRP [0,90]4s laminates.\r\n",
