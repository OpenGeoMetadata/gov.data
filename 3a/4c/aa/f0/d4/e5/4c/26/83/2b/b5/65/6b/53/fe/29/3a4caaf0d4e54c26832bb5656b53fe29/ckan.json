  "notes": " Overview RML in Hamilton, Montana, is a state-of-the-art research facility occupied by world-class scientists. Their mission is to study infectious microbes that cause disease in humans and animals, ultimately hoping to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for these diseases. Because of its 100-year history and expertise in infectious disease research, RML is poised to play a leading role in the effort to improve the nation&amp;#39;s knowledge about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Along with its parent organization,NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health, RML willcontinue to focus its studies on developing new diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for a wide variety of diseases. Integrated Research Facility To carry out research on these emerging and re-emerging pathogens in a safe environment, an Integrated Research Facility opened on the RML campus in 2008. The building, which contains high containment laboratories,employs the highest possible safety standards to protect scientists and the surrounding community. Building design complies with stringent federal and state regulations for construction, use, security, inspection, and certification. The IRF construction project began in fall 2004 and ended in 2008.  ",
