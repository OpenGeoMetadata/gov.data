    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Technological advances (GPWS, TCAS, FMS, WAAS, ESV, ADS-B) improved flight safety but engendered more complexity and increased pilot/computer interaction and workload with aviation accident rate unchanged for the past decade. Cockpit interactions would be safer and more efficient thorugh Voice Communication. Though Voice Recognition systems are becoming widely used, in flight environment conditions usage has been limited due to the unique challenges of elevated noise levels, specific cockpit lexicon, limited cockpit hardware, and lack of standardization.  SouthernAir Aviation Inc. has developed a NextGen Voice Activated Cockpit Management system with applications for flight procedures, emergency procedures, control of aircraft systems and flight management systems.  From simple to complex architectures, the system syncronizes software applications and aircraft systems in a unified model of both language and safety critical development environment to voice activate functions using NextGen Voice Recognition with heuristic pilot response.  Procedures are enabled through wireless Bluetooth connection or wired communication. Additional tools of the system include a novel HMM Model comprising a decision management algorithm and synthetic lexicon for parsing and contiguous recognition.  All the performance requirements are met within a 2&#37; time-slice of a 700MHz Power PC processor and within 1 GB of memory.  Unique key capabilities include: Automatic Lexicon Development, Phonetic Distance Analysis, Coarticulation Handling, Accent Tolerability.  The NextGen advanced performance relies on allophone parsing and reduced recognition error with data processing in real-time, ideal for critical emergency situations. This system is remarkable in that it achieves very high recognition rates (98&#37;) with a very large command set (131,000 unique words and thousands of word combinations).\r\n\r\nWe gratefully acknowledge NASA SBIR Phase I Support.",
