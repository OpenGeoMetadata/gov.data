    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Quantum-well structures embodied on single crystal silicon germanium drastically enhanced carrier mobilities.&amp;nbsp; The cell-to-cell circuits of quantum-well PV cells are laid out at the bottom of epitaxial layers, unlike the circuits laying out at the top of the conventional PV cells which cut off the incident solar flux up to 15&#37; level. Since the circuit layout is built at the bottom of PV array, the circuits are densely laid out to reduce the internal resistance substantially. Again since silicon germanium compound has much broader bandgap structure than silicon alone, it can utilize more solar energy to free up valence band electrons. Structurally, the sapphire substrate surface of quantum-well PV cells is very strong and does not require any special protective coatings and frames to hold them. Therefore, the anticipated life of quantum-well PV cells is more than ten-times longer than Si PV cells. Summing up these advantages of quatum-well PV cells, the overall conversion efficiency would reach well beyond 35&#37; and the energy density would be tripled as compared to the conventional PV cells. The overall cost factor would be 5 cents per kWh competitively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
