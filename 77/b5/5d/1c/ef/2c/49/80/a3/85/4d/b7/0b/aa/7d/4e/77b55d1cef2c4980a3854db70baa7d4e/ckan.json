    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains three data files. One file (.csv format) provides above- and below-ground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) data for a wet arctic tundra meadow (Biome research site 2, Dupontia meadow, vegetation type V) studied from 1970 to 1971 at Point Barrow, Alaska, USA, (71.30 N -156.67 W Elevation 5 m). The second file, also in .csv format, provides net primary productivity (NPP) estimates for different plant growth forms for eight vegetation types recognized in the coastal tundra at Barrow. The third file (.txt format) provides climate data from the weather station at Barrow, Alaska (71.30 N -156.78 W Elevation 31 m). Measurements of above- and below-ground living and dead biomass were made at 10-day intervals during the growing season (mid June to end of August) by harvest methods in 6 x 6 m study plots of undisturbed vegetation. LAI was estimated at 10-day intervals with inclined point quadrats and other methods. NPP estimates are based on harvest at the period of peak above-ground vascular biomass and seasonal CO2 gas exchange estimates in 1972. The studies were conducted as part of the International Biological Program (IBP) U.S. Tundra Biome program. Average total NPP for the eight vegetation communities recognized for the coastal tundra at Barrow was 230 g/m2/year (110 g/m2/year ANPP plus 120 g/m2/year BNPP). Values varied by vegetation community type. Revision Notes: This data set has been revised to correct several values of average below-ground plant standing crop. A second NPP data file has been added to provide NPP estimates for the different vegetation types at the coastal tundra study site from measurements made in 1972. Please see the Data Set Revisions section of this document for detailed information. ",
