    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, Version 2 data \n\nset consists of country-level estimates of urban population, rural population, total population and land area country-wide and in LECZs for \n\nyears 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2100. The LECZs were derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 3 arc second (~90m) data which were \n\npost processed by ISciences LLC to include only elevations less than 20m contiguous to coastlines; and to supplement SRTM data in northern \n\nand southern latitudes. The population and land area statistics presented herein are summarized at the low coastal elevations of less than \n\nor equal to 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 10m, 12m, and 20m. Additionally, estimates are provided for elevations > 20m, and nationally. The spatial \n\ncoverage of this data set includes 202 of the 232 countries and statistical areas delineated in the Gridded Rural-Urban Mapping Project \n\nversion 1 (GRUMPv1) dataset. The 30 omitted areas were not included because they were landlocked, or otherwise lacked coastal features. \n\nThis data set makes use of the population inputs of GRUMPv1 allocated at 3 arc seconds to match the SRTM elevations, and at 30 arc seconds \n\nresolution in order to reflect uncertainty levels in the product resulting from the interplay of input population data resolutions (based \n\non census units) and the elevation data.. Urban and rural areas are differentiated by the GRUMPv1 Urban Extents. See data set documentation \n\nfor specifics on the methodologies used. This data set is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science \n\nInformation Network (CIESIN). ",
