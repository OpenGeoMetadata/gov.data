  "notes": "The primary purpose of the NBS Manual is to provide a standardized and systematic approach for identifying existing or potential contaminant problems on National Wildlife Refuges and other Interior lands. The secondary purpose is to identify lands that may be vulnerable to spills of hazardous substances. These locations may then be targeted for the collection of baseline data which would support future natural resource damage assessments. As previously discussed there were three PCA/BSAs identified. The sampling that has taken place for this study originated as sampling for the FWS Manual for which six PCAs were identified. The results were interpreted to comply with the NBS Manual. The three transport mechanisms identified were confirmed: air, surface water, and biotic. It appears that surface water transport of pesticides and some inorganics has occurred via Oak Orchard Creek (CPIM-3), sediment, fish, and frog contaminant burdens. The air transport mechanism, though harder to confirm, seems apparent due to the overall contaminant burdens on the refuge. CPIM-1 did have some contamination slightly greater than other areas but differentiating air and biotic transport would be difficult. The biotic transport of contaminants from Lake Ontario seems quite evident given the mirex and PCB burdens in the biota sampled, especially those found in great blue herons. There were detectable burdens of known contaminants in all of the matrices sampled. There were exceedances of some concern levels. But, there were no contaminant problems identified that would require additional investigation for remedial activities or further evaluation. Most of the contaminant burdens identified were analogous to matrices from other NWRs and below those of known contaminated areas. Therefore, a reevaluation of the NBS Manual process is recommended in five years. The contaminant burdens observed in the great blue heron chicks do not appear to be the primary factor for the rookeries decline. One of the primary limiting factors for great blue herons selecting a nest site is food availability (Gibbs et al. 1987). This is not the case on Iroquois NWR. There has been manipulation of water levels in the nearby impoundments but not to the extent that forage availability would be affected. There is an outside chance that the great blue herons cannot tolerate the turkey vultures which are also nesting in Seneca Pool. It was noted in the Annual Narrative that the great blue herons abandoned the Sour Springs Road location when great horned owls nested there. A combination of all of the above may have induced the great blue herons to abandon the Seneca Pool rookery.",
