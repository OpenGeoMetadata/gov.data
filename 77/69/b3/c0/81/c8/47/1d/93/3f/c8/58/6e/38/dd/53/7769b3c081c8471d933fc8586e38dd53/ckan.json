  "notes": "In southern California, the coastal California gnatcatcher (CAGN) has become both the flagship species and an umbrella species identified with conservation, where the goal is to have persistent populations maintained within a preserve system. Estimating gnatcatcher distribution and abundance is important to these planning efforts, as well as for maintaining this species. Estimates of these parameters are used to establish baseline numbers to assess direct loss, identify areas for conservation and to track regional gnatcatcher population trends. In 2002 the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office (CFWO) conducted a region-wide survey for CAGN across its range in Orange and San Diego Counties in attempt to obtain estimates for the percent area occupied and abundance of CAGN on lands held in the public trust (see ds196). The results of this study were used to develop a monitoring program of CAGN population trends. In 2004, monitoring addressed presence/absence and abundance of CAGN on MSCP preserved lands and provided an initial estimate of CAGN population trends. In addition, the study collected baseline data to monitor the recovery of CAGN populations that were impacted by the fires in 2004 (Winchell and Doherty 2005). In 2007, the CFWO received funding from SANDAG to conduct the first comprehensive survey county-wide for CAGN. The study area in 2007 was strictly limited to lands within San Diego County currently regulated as preserve lands under an approved Habitat Conservation Plan, other public lands, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Naval Weapons Station Fallbrook. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton was not included because of logistical considerations. Additionally, private lands and tribal lands were excluded from the 2007 study. In 2009, the same protocol was used but different sampling points were surveyed due to changes in land access and the 2007 fires. This dataset was compiled as part of the Southern California Data Integration Project and presents the re",
