These systems remediate water containing hazardous c hemicals and compounds to meet current requirements, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Water Act, and quality requirements for water reuse or discharge. The group&amp;#39;s work includes researc hing pretreatment techniques, chlorine resistant membranes, concentrate disposal tec hniques, renewable energy related to treatment, methods for reducing fouling, reducing operatio n and maintenance costs, and identifying and resolving environmental iss ues. Researc h contracts with universities, nonprofit organizations, and private industry are managed to cost share research and testing projects. The Water Treatment Engineering Researc h Team&amp;#39;s servic es include: &amp;#239;&amp;#239;&amp;#191;&amp;#189;&amp;#183; Adva nced treatment workshops on desalination, reuse, concentrate management, and ot her issues &amp;#239;&amp;#239;&amp;#191;&amp;#189;&amp;#183; Research and pilot stud ies, laboratory and demonstration testing &amp;#239;&amp;#239;&amp;#191;&amp;#189;&amp;#183; Testing and demonstrations of treatment for brackish water, seawater, irrigation return flows, produced water, and reclaimed water &amp;#239;&amp;#239;&amp;#191;&amp;#189;&amp;#183; Standards setting &amp;#239;&amp;#239;&amp;#191;&amp;#189;&amp;#183; Technology transfer The team installs and tests pretreatment systems using advanced water treatment and desalting pilot plants, low-grade heat brine disposal systems, salt-gradient solar ponds, and renewable energy-driven pumping and desalting systems.
