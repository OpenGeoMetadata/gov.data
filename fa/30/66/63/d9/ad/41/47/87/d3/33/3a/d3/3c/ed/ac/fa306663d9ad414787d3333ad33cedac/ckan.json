The map was created from an unprecedented compilation and interpretation of primary geo- logic and soil data; compilation of interim Arc/Info coverages of bedrock aquifers/aquitards, thickness of Quaternary deposits, alluvial aquifers, sinkholes (centers of 400 meter radius circles), and agricultural drainage wells (centers of 400 meter radius circles); overlay techniques; and evaluation of groundwater contamination and well contamination data. This coverage was published in 1991 as part of the 1:500,000 scale, color map: Groundwater Vulnerability Regions of Iowa.",
