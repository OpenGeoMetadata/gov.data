  "notes": " For more than 60 years, Sandia has delivered essential science and technology to resolve the nation&amp;#39;s most challenging security issues. Sandia National Laboratories is operated and managed by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation. Sandia Corporation operates Sandia National Laboratories as a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and supports numerous federal, state, and local government agencies, companies, and organizations.   As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), Sandia may perform work for industry responding to certain types of federal government solicitations. The solicitation must allow FFRDC participation and meet the requirements of Sandia&amp;#39;s management and operating contract with DOE/NNSA. A strong science, technology, and engineering foundation enables Sandia&amp;#39;s mission through a capable research staff working at the forefront of innovation, collaborative research with universities and companies, and discretionary research projects with significant potential impact. In keeping with our vision to be the nation&amp;#39;s premier science and engineering laboratory for national security and technology innovation, we recruit the best and the brightest, equip them with world-class research tools and facilities, and provide opportunities to collaborate with technical experts from many different scientific disciplines. The excitement and importance of our work; an exemplary work environment; partnerships with academia, industry, and government; and our record of historic contributions help us attract exceptional staff. Our employees are recognized by their professional peers for their outstanding contributions. Although most of Sandia&amp;#39;s approximately 10,000 employees work at Sandia&amp;#39;s headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico, or at its second principal laboratory in Livermore, California, others are working at various sites in the U.S. and abroad to deliver innovative and reliable solutions in a changing world.
