    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Cryogenic propellants have the highest energy density of any rocket\nfuel, and are used in most NASA and commercial launch vehicles to power\ntheir ascent.  Cryogenic propellants must be kept cold to preserve them\nand prevent loss via boil off, therefore cryogenic launch vehicles and\nspacecraft must have thermal insulation preserving the cryopropellant.\nProviding good thermal insulation is a balancing act between the\ninsulation desired, the mass of the insulation system, and the\nrobustness of the insulation. SOFI, for example, has high heat leak and\nis not robust. Quest Product Development Corp, and partner Ball\nAerospace, propose to design, fabricate and test innovative Launch\nVehicleMLI (LV-MLI), an integrated advanced thermal insulation and\nlightweight aeroshell for launch vehicle exposed cryopropellant tanks. A\nruggedized of Integrated MLI, high performance lightweight thermal\ninsulation, could be bonded to the sidewalls of LOX/LH2 cryotanks in the\nAtlas V and Delta IV and might be able to withstand aerodynamic loading\nduring launch ascent.  LV-MLI has the potential to significantly improve\nupper stage cryogenic tank thermal insulation, and might increase\npayload capacity for NASA, national security and commercial missions\nthat require multi-hour coasts such as required for MEO and GEO orbit\ninsertion. LV-MLI should have 34&amp;#37; the mass of the SOFI insulation, while\nproviding about 85 times better thermal insulation.   This Phase I\nresearch will evaluate Launch Vehicle-MLI aerodynamic and thermal\nrequirements, analyze aerodynamic and acoustic vibration launch loading,\ndesign LV-MLI insulation system to withstand those aerodynamic and\nlaunch environment loads, design and build a unique launch dynamic load\nsimulator, build and test a LV-MLI prototype for aerodynamic and\nvibration simulated launch loads, and finally compare the structural and\nthermal performance of LV-MLI to the requirements and modeled/predicted performance.",
