  "notes": "The Waianae Ecological Characterization is a digital synthesis of historical and current physical, ecological, and cultural information about the Waianae moku, which is located on the leeward coast of the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. The characterization emphasizes coastal resource management practices and challenges of the Waianae moku. It includes narratives, videos, images, graphics, interviews, stories, chants, subject bibliographies, over 100 geographic information system (GIS) data layers, and several interactive GIS map projects and printable maps. In addition, it introduces a GIS-based tool, called the Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool, to assist resource managers in the assessment of potential impacts of land use change on water quality as a result of impervious surfaces, runoff, sedimentation, and other factors. The Waianae Ecological Characterization was developed by the Hawaii Coastal Zone Management Program, in partnership with the NOAA Coastal Services Center and the NOAA Pacific Services Center. Funding was provided by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. The characterization is available in its entirety on CD-ROM; limited portions are available on the Internet.",
