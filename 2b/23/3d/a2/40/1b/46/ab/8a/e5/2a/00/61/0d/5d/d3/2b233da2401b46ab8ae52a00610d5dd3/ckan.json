The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\n\nThe Coastline Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Class \"Coastline\" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB is L4150. The coastline included in this shapefile was delineated by the Census Bureau in the MAF/TIGER database based on water measurement class for display of statistical information only; its depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and it is not a legal land description. This shapefile should be used for data presentation purposes only.  It is not the official source for the coastline feature. The name assigned to each Coastline feature is a short form of the name of the large body of water bordered by this Coastline feature.\n",
