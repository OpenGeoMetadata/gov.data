    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase II effort involves the development of a novel rodent spaceflight habitat, focusing on care and monitoring of mice for gravitational physiology studies. The effort is tightly linked with the Mars Gravity Biosatellite (MGB) program, a university-led initiative developing a partial gravity free-flyer research platform. It leverages both the Murine Automated Urine Sampler (MAUS) accomplished by Payload Systems, Inc. and MIT during Phase I, including demonstrating biochemical preservation of key analytes for up to five weeks, and further hardware design and prototyping conducted under separately-funded MGB activities. MAUS extends earlier NASA and other laboratory waste management and preservation techniques in a novel manner, enabling solid-state storage and quantitative analysis of small animal urine. In Phase II, we will further refine both the hardware and biochemical techniques developed for the MAUS under Phase I, and integrate these elements into a fully-functional Animal Support Module (ASM). Along with the MAUS, the ASM will include air circulation, cage lighting, video collection, food provision, water supply and additive injection, instrumented floor, and contingency euthanasia systems. This Phase II project will result in critical hardware for the MGB program and important innovations for other rodent-based flight and ground research.",
