  "notes": "Shelta Cave is a cavern system which lies under the northwestern portion of the City of Huntsville, Alabama. The National Speleological Society owns property which contains two pit entrances to the cave, and also maintains their headquarters office on a portion of this property. Shelta Cave formerly housed a faunal community believed to be one of North America's richest in terms of species diversity and abundance. In recent years, there have been great declines in the number of aquatic troglobitic species present in Shelta Cave's subterranean lake. This study was designed to determine whether contaminants have been a factor contributing to the observed declines in aquatic cave fauna. Ten sets of water samples were collected during an approximate 10-week period in the early summer of 1990. The samples were serially collected over an extended period of time to obtain representative samples of any contamination that might enter the cave via storm runoff conveyed through sinkholes. Sediment samples were also collected on the first and last trip into the cave. Water samples were assayed for 28 chlorohydrocarbon compounds, 20 potentially toxic metals, 25 organophosphate and six carbamate pesticides, and six chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. Sediment samples were assayed for 27 chlorohydrocarbon compounds, 23 potentially toxic metals, 25 organophosphate and six carbamate pesticides, and six chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. Although several of the water samples contained detectable traces of potentially harmful contaminants, only heptachlor epoxide was present at a concentration believed to be capable of adversely affecting aquatic cave life. Chlordane, dieldrin, and heptachlor epoxide concentrations detected in Shelta Cave sediments were believed capable of biologically impairing Shelta Cave's aquatic ecosystem. DDT, DDD, and DDE also appeared in the sediment samples, but at concentrations too low to clearly predict adverse biological effects. Bioassays should be used to ascertain the acute and chronic toxicity (i.e., EC50 values) of Shelta Cave's sediments to determine if sediment-related toxicity may be a factor in the reported declines of the aquatic fauna.",
