  "notes": "For the purposes of this management plan, the greater white-fronted goose subspecies (Anseralbifrons frontalis) occurring in the Pacific Flyway is termed the Pacific Flyway Population of Greater White-fronted Goose, or the Pacific white-front. This subspecies is one of two white-fronted goose subspecies that breed in Alaska and winter primarily in California. The other subspecies is the Tule greater white-fronted goose (A. a. gambelli), which has a separate Pacific Flyway management plan, and is referenced in this plan as the Tule white-front. Orthmeyer et al. (1995) have described morphological differences among white-fronts. The Mid-continent Population of White-fronted Goose (A. a. frontalis), some of which breed in interior and northern Alaska, is treated in a separate management plan adopted by the Central, Mississippi, and Pacific Flyway Councils (1998), and is referenced in this plan as the mid-continent white-front. Nearly all Pacific white-fronts breed from the Alaska Peninsula north to the Yukon River, with the majority nesting on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) (Palmer 1976). The primary wintering areas for Pacific white-fronts are the Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta. These areas receive the majority of fall migrants, beginning in late September and they peak by early to mid-November. A small percentage of Pacific white-fronts, mostly from Bristol Bay, migrate early through the Klamath Basin in September, overfly the Sacramento Valley, and winter in the northern highlands of Mexico (Ely and Takekawa 1996).Distribution and use areas of Pacific white-fronts are presented in Figure 1 and Appendix A. Fall counts of Pacific white-fronts declined 85% from the reported historical peak population estimates of 480,000 from 1966-68, to a low of 73,100 in coordinated fall surveys of 1979(O’Neill 1979; Timm and Dau 1979; Raveling 1984). This decline resulted in focused management discussions in 1978 and flyway wide harvest restrictions in 1978. A major conservation program, now known as the YKD Goose Management Plan, was cooperatively implemented in 1984 by the USFWS, ADFG, CDFG, the YKD’s Association of Village Council Presidents (AVCP) – Waterfowl Conservation Committee (WCC), California Waterfowl Association, and Waterfowl Habitat Owners Alliance to reverse the declines in four species of Pacific Flyway geese, including the Pacific white-front. This plan, implemented in 1984, specified measures for reducing the Pacific white-front harvest throughout the flyway, as well as a broad range of needed conservation and education efforts (Pamplin 1986). The successful implementation of this plan, and subsequent harvest strategy developed beginning in 1994, resulted in restoration of the population to objective level by 1996. During the late 1990s, population growth slowed, but the recent peak of 433,400 in 2001 is the highest index since 1968. The purpose of this plan is to establish guidelines for cooperative management of Pacific white-fronts during the planning period 2003-2008, maintaining the population at objective levels through implementation of plan activities and harvest strategies.",
