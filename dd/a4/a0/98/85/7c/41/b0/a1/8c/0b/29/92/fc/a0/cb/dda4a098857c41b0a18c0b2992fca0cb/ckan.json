    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this Phase I project, Impact Technologies, in collaboration with\nProf. R.K. Yedavalli, propose a novel verification environment for\neventual rapid certification of distributed engine control systems\n(DCS).  Our approach is focused on providing a set of tools to the\ngovernment and industry that will allow faster certification of the\ncontrol system as new high-temperature components and control laws are\ndeveloped.  A distributed hardware-in-the-loop (D-HIL) simulation tool\nis proposed to assist NASA and the Distributed Engine Control Working\nGroup (DECWG) to integrate DCS components onto existing and\nnext-generation engines.  The proposed D-HIL simulator consist of a\nthermal test chamber operated by an engine simulation which is capable\nof subjecting components to a range of possible transient thermal\nconditions seen during engine operation , while functioning as elements\nin the networked control loop.  To aid in certification of more complex\ndistributed engine control hardware and software, a set of analysis\ntools is proposed.  The Global Verification Toolset makes use of global\nstability and bounded verification methodologies to allow stability and\nperformance to be assessed in a systematic fashion.  At the conclusion\nof Phase I, the new verification facility and software tools will be\ndemonstrated in a system test using the C-MAPSS engine.",
