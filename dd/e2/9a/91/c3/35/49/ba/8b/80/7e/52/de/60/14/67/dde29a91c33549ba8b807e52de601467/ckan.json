    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA's future space science missions cannot be realized without the state of the art high temperature insulation materials of which higher working temperature, high reliability, and low cost are highly desired. T/J Technologies proposes to develop a high temperature, durable, readily processable electrical insulation materials.  The key element of our approach is the development and demonstration, in a breadboard configuration, the feasibility of a new high temperature polymeric composite material based on organic-inorganic nanocomposites with tailored structure and composition that will dramatically increase the Glass Transition Temperature and working temperature of the host polymer, polyimides. Future work of this proposed research, during phase II, will be mainly focused on developing all the associated technologies. The development of high working temperature, durable, radiation resistant electrical insulation materials is important for on-board propulsion and power systems for manned and unmanned deep space missions within NASA as well as electrical and microelectronic industries for applications such as capacitors, electric motors, circuit-printing films, semiconductor coating, etc.",
