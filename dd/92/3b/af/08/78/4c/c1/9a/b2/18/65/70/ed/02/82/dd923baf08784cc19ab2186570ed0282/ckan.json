    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Space Propulsion Group, Inc. proposes to conduct systems studies to quantify the performance and cost advantages of Nytrox oxidizers for small launch vehicles. This new class of oxidizers is composed of mixtures of nitrous oxide (N2O) and oxygen (O2) and has significant advantages over the pure oxidizers, some of which can be summarized as 1) higher density, Isp and safer operation compared to N2O, 2) non-cryogenic operation and ease of development of stable and efficient motors compared to LOX. Thus Nytrox is expected to be an important enabling technology for developing low cost, high performance NanoSat launch vehicles. The primary goal of the Phase I effort is to quantify the increase in the payload mass by changing the oxidizer from N2O to Nytrox for the upper stages of a small launch system.  In the proposed effort the cost and operational issues associated with producing, transporting and storing the Nytrox oxidizers shall be also be quantified. The planning for the third stage motor development and ground testing that will be conducted in Phase II shall be started in Phase I.  Technology Readiness Level ranges of 2-3 and 5-6 are expected at the end of the Phase I and II, respectively.",
