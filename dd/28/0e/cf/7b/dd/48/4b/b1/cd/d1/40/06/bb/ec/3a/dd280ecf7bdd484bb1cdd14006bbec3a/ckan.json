  "notes": "The California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) is the smallest and most secretive member of the rail family and has been sparsely studied. It is a sparrow sized bird, black above, with white speckling, and a chestnut nape. Although the first specimen was collected in 1859 it came from the Farallon Islands and spawned years of confusion with regard to its distribution and identification because the bird was a rare migrant to the islands (Wilbur 1974). Knowledge of its life history remains elusive today. Historically, California Black Rails were collected throughout San Francisco Bay; including western Marin County, Suisun marshes, and in the south bay at Newark, Redwood City, and Alameda (Wilbur 1974). All of these collection sites were in fresh or saltwater marshes which used to fringe the entire bay in widths of 2 to 5 miles. Black Rails occur primarily in high tidal salt marshes and occasionally in fresh or brackish marshes. The vegetation is dominated by pickleweed (Salicornia sp.) in salt marsh or rushes (Scirpus sp.) in areas with more freshwater influence. The most recent study of the rail found them almost exclusively in marshland with unrestricted tidal influence; classified on National Wetland Inventory maps as \"estuarine, intertidal, emergent, regularly flooded (E2EMN)\" (Evens and Page 1991). The California Black Rail is currently listed as a threatened species by the California Department of Fish and Game and is listed as a category 2 species by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Little is known about the distribution and abundance of Black Rails along Tolay Creek in Sonoma County. A single bird was seen or heard at Midshipman Point, Lower Tubbs Island in February, July, and September of 1977 and two birds were found there in May of 1978 (Manolis 1978). A survey conducted by Point Reyes Bird Observatory (PRBO) in 1988 flushed one bird from Lower Tubbs Island and heard two others in the salt marsh west of the mouth of Tolay Creek (Evens and Page 1991). Rails were heard at 40% of 599 listening stations and the highest abundances in the San Francisco Bay estuary occurred in the Napa and Petaluma marshes (84.4% of 45 stations, average=1.60 rails/station). I attempted to repeat the station locations and protocol from the section of the PRBO study along Tolay Creek and around Lower Tubbs Island in order to make comparisons feasible. California Black Rail censuses were conducted along Tolay Creek in Sonoma County on areas belonging to the California Department of Fish and Game and within the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. A dredging project is planned for the lower reaches of Tolay Creek in order to improve water flow and mixing between the bay tides and freshwater outflow. This survey was conducted to determine the presence and location of any California Black Rails in the proposed working area in order to avoid disturbance to them or destruction of their habitat.",
