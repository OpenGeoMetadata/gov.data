  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Integrated Diagnostics and Automated Test Systems (IDATS) Laboratory provides fleet support through the diagnosis of avionics systems, testability analysis and the development of next-generation automatic test equipment (ATE) products. The IDATS Lab also maintains a robust research and development program dedicated to finding novel solutions to common diagnostics issues.  Function:  The IDATS Lab uses a wide range of technology to support diagnostic, prognostic and maintenance requirements of naval aviation to ensure weapons systems&amp;#39; operational readiness and aircraft operation availability. The IDATS Lab is capable of not only diagnosing avionics, but also of providing testability analysis, supportability analysis, ATE development and integration (including net-centric ATE) and a wide range of cutting-edge research and development.  Capabilities:  Major IDATS Lab components include a suite of high-end laboratory equipment, various professional software for electronics simulation and design as well as statistical analysis software. The IDATS Lab also contains the capability to mill two-layer circuit cards for the purpose of rapid prototyping. The lab itself is composed of three independently electromagnetic interference (EMI) shieldable rooms, which allow the lab to test systems that radiate RF energy, such as radar and wireless communication systems.   Since opening its doors in 2010, several ground-breaking products have emerged from the IDATS Lab. They include the Diagnostics Avionics Tester, an electro-optics tester for F/A-18 and the first net-centric O-level tester in Navy/Marine Corps inventory; the &amp;quot;Smart Connector&amp;quot; Link-16 radio power supply tester; and the Pinless Connector, a solution to bent, pushed or corroded pins in military connectors.
