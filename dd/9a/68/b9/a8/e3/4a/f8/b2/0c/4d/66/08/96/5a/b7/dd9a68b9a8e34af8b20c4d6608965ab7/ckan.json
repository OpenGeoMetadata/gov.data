  "notes": "\r\n\r\nLinear Water Features includes single-line drainage water features and artificial path features that run through double-line drainage features such as rivers and streams, and serve as a linear representation of these features.  The artificial path features may correspond to those in the USGS National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD).  However, in many cases the features do not match NHD equivalent feature and will not carry the NHD metadata codes.  These features have a MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) beginning with an \"H\" to indicate the super class of Hydrographic Features.  \r\n",
