    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Long duration spaceflight and exploration missions will require complex operations and demanding tasks. Success will therefore depend on the knowledge and flexibility of the crew and the critical tools at their disposal. The purpose of this Phase II project is to develop a software tool that combines intelligent tutoring (or logic) with highly interactive 3D simulation software to create an on-demand situational training and operations support system. The platform will include a user interface that allows subject matter experts ? not programmers - to author the logic and intelligent portion of each simulation in a non-programming environment for more cost effective training systems development. The project includes the creation of two new application program interfaces (API) an XML schema and several new Java functions to allow for communication between the logic engine software and the 3D scene. A menu-driven authoring interface will then be created. The feasibility of the system was determined in the Phase I project, and demonstrated with a 3D simulated NASA EVA decontamination trainer. For Phase II, a prototype of the system will be created for a current NASA scenario-based training system to test the commercial-readiness of the authoring tool. ",
