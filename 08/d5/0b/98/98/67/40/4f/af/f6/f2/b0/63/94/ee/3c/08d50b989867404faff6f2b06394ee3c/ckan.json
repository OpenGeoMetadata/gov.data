    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Long-duration space missions such as the upcoming Moon and Mars missions require reliable systems for the preparation of potable water through efficient recycling, and prevention of biofilm growth on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and water lines.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes a novel technology to simultaneously reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) processed water, and control biofilm formation on water lines, surfaces and membranes within the water reclamation unit utilized on board spacecraft and within future planetary habitats.  This technology is based on Lynntech's proprietary electrochemical on demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. The on-demand produced oxidizer can be added to the primary processed water from the BWP unit.  Using this innovative approach in the form of a compact TOC and microbial count (MC) reduction module which will be situated in line with the BWP unit, Lynntech aims to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in the TOC content within the BWP processed water.  The residual oxidizer/disinfectant and reduced TOC will prevent the formation of biofilms on the RO membrane and water lines and will reduce the equivalent system mass by lowering the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in their size and weight.  Phase I work will concentrate on providing proof-of-concept for the technology while Phase II will involve the fabrication of a prototype TOC and MC reduction module and its integration with the Integrated Advanced Water Recovery Test System operational at NASA-JSC.",
