  "notes": "This study provides mercury (Hg) exposure information for a high-risk wildlife group in an area of the continental U.S. that has been predicted by the U.S. EPA to receive high amounts of wet and dry atmospheric Hg deposition. Local-scale deposition (e.g., Maine chlor-alkali plant and municipal waste incinerators), long-range transport deposition (e.g., from the Midwest), and increasing global atmospheric reservoirs all contribute to Hg availability on Maine's landscape. Recent geographic studies indicate that Maine's Common Loon and Bald Eagle breeding population are exposed to some of the highest levels of methylmercury (MeHg) in North America. We quantified the extent of Hg availability for five piscivorous birds on 92 lakes across Maine. All species exhibited elevated levels of Hg in their blood, feathers, and eggs. The Common Loon was the species most widely represented and adults showed the highest levels of Hg exposure. Our non-random sampling of Maine lakes prevented a statewide assessment of risk. However, Hg levels in Common Loons indicate that 31% of the adult males, 30% of the juveniles, 24% of the eggs, and 10% of the adult females exceeded impact thresholds determined by laboratory and in situ studies. Based upon data from previous studies, 48% of juvenile Bald Eagles were at risk. Interior nesting pairs of eagles had Hg concentrations over 6 times higher than coastal or riverine pairs. Osprey Hg concentrations were also higher on interior lakes but were significantly lower than eagle Hg levels. The calculated uptake of dietary MeHg is considered to be 3-4 times higher in the Belted Kingfisher than the other target piscivorous birds and was apparent on Flagstaff Lake when compared to young loons and mergansers. Common Mergansers sampled also exhibited high exposure to Hg. There were few indications of statewide geographic patterns in MeHg availability except that marine habitats tended to have significantly lower levels than interior Maine. There was also an apparent effect from atmospheric Hg being deposited downwind of the Orrington area as indicated by loon blood and egg samples. Lake morphometric and water chemistry Hg patterns were not readily apparent dictating the need for a lake to lake sampling scheme. We developed an index that included each species and matrix sampled. It indicated that a majority of Maine lakes sampled generate enough MeHg to cause moderate to high risk to loons (50%) and the piscivorous bird community (70%).",
