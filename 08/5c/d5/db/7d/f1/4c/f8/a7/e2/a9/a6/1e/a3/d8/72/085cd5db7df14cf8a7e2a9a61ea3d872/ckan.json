  "notes": "This report presents the results of cooperative studies ofevapotranspiration by phreatophytes in the Winnemucca reachof the Humboldt River valley. Water that is wasted by evapotranspirationfrom areas of low beneficial phreatophytes is oneof the largest unknowns in the water budget of the reach.In order to obtain information with which to evaluate theconsumptive waste, studies of the water use of four woodyphreatophytes greasewood, rabbitbrush, willow, and wildrosewere undertaken in evapotranspiration tanks at the Winnemuccatest site.Twelve tanks ranging in size from 30 feet square and 10.5 feetdeep to 10 feet square and 7 feet deep were constructed. Seedlingsof greasewood were planted in 2 tanks and rabbitbrush in3 tanks; cuttings of willow were planted in 3 tanks and wildrosein 3 tanks. The twelfth was left bare. The tanks wereconstructed in place by lining excavated pits with watertightplastic membranes, providing a water-distribution system on thebottom and backfilling with the excavated material. The tankswere operated during the growing season April 1 to October 20from 1961-67, inclusive. Water metered into elevated reservoirswas supplied by gravity to the evapotranspiration tanks.Evapotranspiration by the plants was computed as the sum ofrainfall, soil-moisture depletion and water supplied to the tanksduring the growing season. Plant growth and development wererecorded by photographs and transects. Foliage volumes werecomputed from the transect data as the product of the averageheight, the cover density of the plants, and the area of the tank.Foliage volumes and water use were affected by difference indepths to the water level, damage to the plants by rabbits and byinsects, and, for the greasewood and rabbitbrush, by accumulationof boron in toxic concentrations in the root zone. The damageswere alleviated by removing rabbits from the test site, byspraying the insect-infested plants, and by reducing the boroncontent in the root zone by backwash leaching.Boron content of undisturbed soil, adjacent to the greasewoodtanks, ranged from 13 to 32 milligrams per kilogram in thetop 1.5 feet, and from 5 to 0.9 milligrams per kilogram between5 and 9 feet. Green greasewood leaves had a boron content thatranged from 196 to 233 milligrams per kilogram.Evapotranspiration by a given species of phreatophytes isaffected by climatic conditions, of which temperature is themost important. Water use by greasewood and rabbitbrush inApril was only about 2 percent of the yearly total, whereas duringthe months of peak use it was 28 percent. More than twothirdsof the annual use occurred during June, July, and August.Evapotranspiration, expressed on an areal basis as depth overa unit area, gives no indication of growth conditions for whichthe information was obtained and may result in serious errorwhen transposed to areas of dissimilar growth conditions. Someof the difficulties and uncertainties of the areal method may beavoided by expressing evapotranspiration on a volume-of-foliagebasis, as a quantity of water per unit of foliage volume. Themethod presumes that transpiration by a species is proportionalto the total transpiring leaf area, and so proportional to thefoliage volume. In the results of the studies, evapotranspirationis expressed in both quantities. The annual use of water rangedrather widely over the study period, as the plants responded tothe effect of plant damage, boron toxicity, depth to the waterlevel, and warmth and length of the growing seasons. Draft fromthe water table, equivalent to the water supplied to the tanks,varied with the rainfall. It was greatest when rainfall was scant,and least when the rams were copious.",
