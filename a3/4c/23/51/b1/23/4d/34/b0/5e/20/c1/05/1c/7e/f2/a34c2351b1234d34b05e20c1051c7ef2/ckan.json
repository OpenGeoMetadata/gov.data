  "notes": "  Program Capabilities  SRL has analytical capability in pesticide residues, trace elements, micro-analytical biology (entomology and mammalian/bird filth elements), chemical indices of decomposition, colors, sulfites, drug assay and dissolution testing, microbiological testing of foods, drugs, devices and cosmetics, nutrient analyses and mycotoxins in foods.The Microbiology Laboratory is equipped for sterility analysis and pyrogen testing via Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) which uses an enzyme from the amebocytes in the blood of the horseshoe crab ( Limulus polyphemus), which coagulates when bacterial endotoxin is present.SRL has expertise in DNA hybridization techniques for virulence testing of pathogenic bacteria and immunosorbent assay procedures for the detection of pathogens and bacterial toxins. Recently acquired DNA sequencing capacity for unknown pathogen identification and fish speciation to provide seafood safety and prevention of economic fraud.  Specialized Capabilities  In addition to servicing its own districts, SRL&amp;#39;s Microbiology Laboratory is also the national servicing laboratory for: penicillin assay, identification of strains of Vibrio cholerae, oyster samples implicated in Vibrio vulnificus illnesses, heat determination of spores found in canned food samples, and Enterobacter sakazakii in infant formula.Additionally, SRL&amp;#39;s Chemistry Laboratories conduct analyses of chloramphenicol in honey and of aflatoxin in domestic products for all ORA districts. SRL is the home of the Atlanta Center for Nutrient Analysis (ACNA), which is the servicing laboratory to all districts for nutrient analysis on domestic and imported foods that bear nutrition labeling, including infant formulas, medical foods and dietary supplements for nutrients. ACNA employs both chemical and microbiological assays for nutrient determinations. The laboratory is also experienced in the testing of allergenic ingredients in foods. Currently, SRL is working with the Center for Tobacco Products and CDC on developing capability for the analysis of tobacco products.  ",
