  "notes": "This report is one of a continuing study, the purposes and technique of which have already been set forth. It had its origin in Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1934; it was continues in Alberta in 1935. The results of those first two years’ work have appeared in printed form, USDA Circular 433, Crow-waterfowl Relationships, under date of June, 1937(?). In 1936 the scene of the studies was shifted to the Lower Souris Refuge in North Dakota. Their character likewise was altered and enlarged. Less exclusively a study of the relation of the crow to the nesting waterfowl, it became a broad program of research into all factors and conditions that affected the welfare of nesting waterfowl, coupled with an appraisal of the waterfowl production capacities of that area. A manuscript report on the results of that year’s work has been submitted. The contribution to the continuing study discusses the results of the field work of the spring and summer of 1937. In submitting it, the writer wishes to acknowledge the great help given by Mr. M. C. Hammond, Biological Aide, stationed at the Lower Souris Refuge who shared equally the duties of nest inspection and recording and at the close of the work prepared his own report on the summer’s work which was transmitted to the Migratory Waterfowl Division. Two tables appearing in Mr. Hammond’s report have also been incorporated in this manuscript. With respect to figures in certain other tables presented here it may be explained that they may be somewhat at variance with similar data submitted by Mr. Hammond. This had come about through a review of all original evidence and notes gathered during the past summer, resulting in some changes of interpretation here and there. In no case, however, do the altered figures greatly change the conclusions reached.",
