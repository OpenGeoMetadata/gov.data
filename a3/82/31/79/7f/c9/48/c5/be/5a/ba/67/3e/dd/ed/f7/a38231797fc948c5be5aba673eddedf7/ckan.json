    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We present in this article a case study of the probabilistic\r\napproach to model-based diagnosis. Here, the diagnosed\r\nsystem is a real-world electrical power system, namely the\r\nAdvanced Diagnostic and Prognostic Testbed (ADAPT) located\r\nat the NASA Ames Research Center. Our probabilistic approach\r\nis formally well-founded, and based on Bayesian networks and\r\narithmetic circuits. We pay special attention to meeting two of the\r\nmain challenges  model development and real-time reasoning\r\n often associated with real-world application of model-based\r\ndiagnosis technologies. To address the challenge of model development,\r\nwe develop a systematic approach to representing electrical\r\npower systems as Bayesian networks, supported by an easy-touse\r\nspeci\u0002cation language. To address the real-time reasoning\r\nchallenge, we compile Bayesian networks into arithmetic circuits.\r\nArithmetic circuit evaluation supports real-time diagnosis by\r\nbeing predictable and fast. In experiments with the ADAPT\r\nBayesian network, which contains 503 discrete nodes and 579\r\nedges and produces accurate results, the time taken to compute\r\nthe most probable explanation using arithmetic circuits has a\r\nmean of 0.2625 milliseconds and a standard deviation of 0.2028\r\nmilliseconds. In comparative experiments, we found that while\r\nthe variable elimination and join tree propagation algorithms\r\nalso perform very well in the ADAPT setting, arithmetic circuit\r\nevaluation was an order of magnitude or more faster.\r\n\r\n**Reference:**\r\n\r\nO.
