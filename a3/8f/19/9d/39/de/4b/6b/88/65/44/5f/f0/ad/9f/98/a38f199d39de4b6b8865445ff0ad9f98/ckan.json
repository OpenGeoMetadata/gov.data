  "notes": " Among the many cancer research laboratories operated by NCI, the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research(FNLCR) is unique in that it is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center-one of 41 such centers in the United States that operate under a broad charter to respond rapidly and efficiently to meet the research and development needs of their government sponsors. The Frederick National Lab is overseen by NCI and operated by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. Located on NCI&amp;#39;s Frederick, Maryland, campus, the FNLCR combines private sector business practices with government infrastructure to conduct research in genetics, proteomics, bioinformatics, biomedical computing, animal sciences, and clinical operations. As a national resource, the FNLCR provides cancer researchers a bridge between basic research and clinical practice with support that is not readily available elsewhere. By using private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of NCI, the FNLCR brings together public and private partners to address significant cancer research challenges.

The FFRDC also supports other institutes of NIH and wide range of research collaborations and partnershipswith third parties, consistent with NCI&amp;#39;s mission. The Frederick National Laboratory conducts basic, translational, and preclinicalresearch and development in cancer and AIDS. FNLCR investigators and technical staff collaborate with other government agencies, academic institutions, life-science companies, and nonprofit research organizations to develop the next generation of tests and treatments that will benefit families affected by cancer. The lab has established a programthrough which outside organizations -- including life science companies and other commercial entities -- can enter directly into cooperative research and development agreements with Leidos Biomedical Research. These agreements can accommodate the development of new technologies for research, or for clinical applications that benefit patients. Under the agreements, partners can have first option to exclusive or nonexclusive commercial license. The Frederick National Lab offers education, training, and professional development, as well as expert consultation in quality control, regulatory affairs, and patient safety. As a national resource, FNLCR helps biomedical scientists form a solid bridge between basic research and clinical practice, with support that is not readily available elsewhere. "
