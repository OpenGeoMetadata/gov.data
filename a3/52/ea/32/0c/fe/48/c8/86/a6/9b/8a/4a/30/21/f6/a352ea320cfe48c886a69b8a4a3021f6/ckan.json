  "notes": "This study is part of a larger climate change program looking at SLR and storm effects within tidal marshes along the Pacific coast. The objectives of this study were to (1) inventory plant species composition and relationship to elevation and tidal ranges; (2) inventory elevation and marsh accretion rates, and (3) use high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to develop SLR marsh and vegetation response models to 2110 for the Sweetwater Marsh unit (hereafter Sweetwater) of the San Diego Bay NWR using the Wetland Accretion Rate Model for Ecosystem Resilience model. Sweetwater marsh is part of the San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Located in Chula Vista, California, it is the largest remaining salt marsh on San Diego Bay. We collected baseline elevation, tidal inundation, and vegetation on 68 hectares of this 128-hectare marsh to develop sea-level rise (SLR) and vegetation response models to 2110. Accretion rates were determined with sediment core data. We used Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS; + 2 cm measured vertical accuracy) to conduct on-the-ground elevation surveys. Vegetation was surveyed at a quarter of elevation points within 0.25 m2 quadrats for species composition, percent cover, and height. We established water level monitoring stations at two locations to capture local annual variation in tidal inundation and to determine elevation relative to site-specific tidal datum. A total of 1,156 elevation measurements were collected and interpolated in ArcGIS 10.2.1 (Kriging method) into a continuous 5 x 5 m grid cell raster. Mean root-mean-square (RMS) error for all interpolations was 0.11 and the model mean standard error was 0.12, showing a good measure of accuracy for our elevation models. A total of 274 vegetation plots were surveyed, and 15 plant species were recorded. Sarcocornia pacifica was the most common species surveyed, occurring at 64 percent of vegetation plots. Three sediment cores were collected along an elevation gradient at Sweetwater marsh to determine historic accretion rates with horizon marker dating techniques (137Cs). Percent organic matter, porosity, compaction, and decomposition were incorporated with accretion rates, elevation, and tidal range data and were inputs into the Wetland Accretion Response Model for Ecosystem Resilience (WARMER, Swanson et al. 2013) used to assess marsh persistence with sea-level rise. Vegetation communities were categorized based on observed elevation relative to local tidal datum to develop marsh zones for model interpretation. Marsh zones were defined as below mean sea level (MSL) ( 87 cm MSL). Currently Sweetwater is characterized by mid and high marsh vegetation (49 and 33 percent of total area respectively). Results from the WARMER modeling suggested that under mid (+93 cm) SLR scenarios, the marsh can keep pace until 2050; thereafter, low marsh becomes dominant by 2070 (60 percent) and mudflat increases in extent by 2110 (34 percent). Results under high (+166 cm) SLR scenario show that the marsh can keep pace until 2040; thereafter, low marsh becomes dominant by 2050 (55 percent) and by 2110 the marsh is 91 percent mudflat and 8 percent below MLLW.",
