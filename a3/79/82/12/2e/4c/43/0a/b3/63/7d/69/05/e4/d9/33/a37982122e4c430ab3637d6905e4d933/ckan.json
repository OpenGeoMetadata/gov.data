  "notes": " ATR controls fully-instrumented and integrated test ranges that provide full-service support for cradle-to-grave testing. Airspace and surface target areas are used for test and evaluation of aircraft and for warfighter training missions. In addition to radar and optical tracking systems, fixed and mobile assets provide the necessary capabilities for diverse testing and training scenarios.The Telemetry Data Center provides real-time radio-link reception, translation, processing and display of test data using the Real-time Telemetry Processing System. This widely used system provides real-time test information from up to nine separate in-flight aircraft to ground engineering personnel. Test teams operate the system from any of the nine Project Engineer Stations. The inshore operating area, known as the Chesapeake Test Range, consists of selected targets and airspace covering regions over the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. Additional air/sea space is available in the Atlantic Warning Areas, located east of the Delmarva Peninsula over the Atlantic Ocean. ATR controls an aerial firing range and two exclusive-use surface target areas in the Chesapeake Test Range restricted areas. The 1,000-acre Webster Field Annex is located about 13 miles southwest of Patuxent River. Webster Field is used as an auxiliary field for daylight testing and is home to VC-6, a squadron devoted to maintaining the Pioneer Unmanned Air System (UAS). ATR provides real-time connectivity to NASA Wallops Flight Facility; Fleet Area Control &amp;amp; Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FACSFAC VACAPES); NAVAIR simulation and stimulation laboratories; and other NAVAIR and DoD major test ranges. ATR is the Navy&amp;#39;s principal Research, Development, Test &amp;amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E), fleet support activity for Naval aircraft, engines, avionics, aircraft support systems and ship/shore air operations. The open-air range and ground test facilities developed for RDT&amp;amp;E also have tremendous application for fleet and warfighter pre-deployment systems grooming and readiness training exercises. ATR coordinates multiple training events in airspace at ATR or at sites around the country. Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs) are routinely supported: from small, unit-level events to large-scale, joint exercises.  ",
