    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The innovation of the work herein proposed is the development of standards for software autonomous agents.  These standards are essential to achieve software agent-based systems whose software is reusable and interoperable.  For NASA, many new developments, from scheduling, to planning and resource allocation, to simulation, to transportation logistics, etc are exploiting the emerging technology of software agents.  Because software agents do not use any form of calling hierarchy to create a total system they are inherently more easily reused and inherently more interoperable than conventional software.  On the other hand, NASA and other users of software agent technology will not fully benefit from this advantage without a better understanding of what is required for software agents to be reusable and interoperable, and without the development of formal specifications and eventually standards that enable diverse developers to build reusable and interoperable software agents. The proposed work will help insure that future software agents developed for KSC are more reusable and more interoperable than what is achieved today.  It also offers Intelligent Automation, Incorporated and KSC the opportunity to make an international impact on agent-based software for the next decade and beyond.  ",
