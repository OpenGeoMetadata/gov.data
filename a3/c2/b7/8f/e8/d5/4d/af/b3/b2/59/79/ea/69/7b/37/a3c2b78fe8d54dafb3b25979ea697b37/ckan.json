    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose the development of a high fidelity computational approach for\nunsteady calculations of strongly separated non-equilibrium\nhigh-enthalpy hypersonic flows. The  goal is to integrate the now proven\npartially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method for unsteady flow\nsimulations with the most advanced closure models for compressibility,\nhigh-enthalpy (flow - thermodynamics coupling) and  non-equilibrium\n(flow - chemistry coupling) effects. The PANS model has been established\nas a reliable model for computing separation in low and high speed\nregimes in two recently conclude NASA NRA projects -- 1. RANS and PANS\nmodeling of hypersonic turbulent mixing environment;  2. Modeling of\nstrongly separated flows with the PANS bridging method. The current\nproposal is to incorporate further hypersonic effect closures into PANS.\nPhysics-based closure models for flow-thermochemistry interactions have\nbeen under development in Girimaji's group at Texas A&amp;amp;M under AFOSR\nMURI funding -- Transition and Turbulence modeling in\nnon-thermochemical-equilibrium hypersonic flows. Important closure model\nbuilding blocks for hypersonic processes are now available from the\nabove fundamental research efforts. The combination of PANS and these\nadvanced high-speed models will lead to a unique capability for\ncomputing hypersonic flow separation with ablation, chemistry and\ncompressibility effects. For Phase I, we propose a logical sequence of\nverification-validation computations to demonstrate the potential of the\nvarious individual closures in separated high-speed high-enthalpy flows.\nWhile in-house codes are available for the proposed development, we will\nalso consider using any of the NASA codes: USM3D, OVERFLOW, VULCAN or\nany of the other codes suggested by the grantor. Subsequent work (Phase\nII) will focus on the assembly of the individual components and\ndevelopment of an unique high-fidelity computational capability for\nhypersonic vehicle design, testing and development.",
