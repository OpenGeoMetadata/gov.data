    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The NASA application requires a system that can generate 3D images of non-metallic material when access is limited to one side of the material. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and build a new, practical, potentially portable, battery operated, self-contained Compton x-ray backscatter 3D imaging system by using a specially designed automated rotationally movable x-ray source, a 2D x-ray detector with a highly collimator system and the development of a suitable 3D processing computer model. In the proposed x-ray imaging system, the primary technical advance will be to extend methods that normally supply a 2D projected image through a sheet of material, to a 3D image with more complicated features at different depths, such as voids, cracks, corrosion or delaminations. The portability of the proposed imaging system will allow bringing it to the object to be imaged. Phase 2 will be conducted with a focus on technology transition and an understanding of what it will take to demonstrate and qualify the proposed method in a prototype for use in an actual imaging system and a realistic environment. Also in Phase II, time reduction in setup, data image acquisition, and 3D-image reconstruction analysis will be realized by remote automated control of the operation and movement of a brighter x-ray source and a state-of-the-art digital flat panel detector in conjunction with a highly  collimator system.
