    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a generalized lattice Boltzmann (GLB) approach as a potential computational aeroacoustics (CAA) tool for noise prediction thus contributing to NASA's goal of reducing noise levels of subsonic aircraft. Lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) based simulations are attractive for CAA as they can handle very complex geometries and parallelize with excellent scalability. This enables efficient simulation of very large problems, such as airframe systems. The innovativeness of the proposed GLB method lies in employing multiple relaxation times to capture different hydrodynamic/acoustic modes accurately, in contrast to usual LBE solution methods using a single relaxation time for all modes. The GLB approach would enable higher fidelity CAA simulations as well as exhibit stability at higher Reynolds numbers. Multiple relaxation times can also enable represent turbulence better for large eddy simulation. In phase I, the feasibility of the GLB method will be evaluated by coding a 3D solver, including a subgrid scale turbulence model and multiblock grid refinement algorithms, with testing against several CAA benchmark problems. If successful, a validated package based on the GLB method interfaced to NASA pre/post processors, like CART3D, for complex geometries would be developed in Phase II.",
