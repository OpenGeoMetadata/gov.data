    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Luna Innovations has teamed with the University of Alabama, Huntsville, to develop a miniature flush-mounted fiber-optic pressure sensor that will allow accurate, high-frequency high-pressure measurement of LOx and LH2.  The Innovation of this proposed development is that the miniature flush-mounted fiber-optic pressure sensor is not intrusive, is intrinsically safe, and is a novel adaptation of proven technology.  To insure compatibility with the LOx environment, the sensor has been constructed from metal-oxides, ceramics and other materials that are intrinsically safe.  The sensor will help engineers optimize performance of liquid fueled rocket engines for the next generation of reusable lift vehicles, and flight versions of the sensors will enable real-time monitoring and control of the engines, improving safety and enabling commercialization of space.  During the Phase I, prototype sensors were demonstrated in Liquid Oxygen (LOx) at temperatures of -196&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.  The sensor was able to measure pressures over 1000 psi and transients exceeding 4500 psi/sec rates of change without failure.  During the Phase II, optimized thermally compensated sensors will be constructed and extensive tests conducted to advance the technology to pre-production status.  This system meets NASA's goals by providing LOx and LH2 pressure data while: 1) minimizing intrusion, 2) improving reliability, 3) having fast response time, and 4) being intrinsically safe.",
