  "notes": "Water supplies utilized by national fish hatcheries are generally presumed to be uncontaminated. However, sublethal concentrations of potentially toxic substances in water used for fish rearing could go undetected in routine surveys of water quality. Therefore, surface water, groundwater, sediment, algae, and fish were sampled at Dexter National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center (NFTC) and the Mescalero National Fish Hatchery (NFH) in New Mexico. These samples were tested for metals and selected organic compounds and the analytical results were compared to national and regional background concentrations and various criteria correlated with adverse effects to fish, fish predators, and anglers that might consume those fish. Contaminants that could adversely affect fish and/or wildlife or humans consuming those fish at Dexter NFTC include mercury and selenium. PCBs, DDE, and DDD were also detected in a Yaqui catfish egg mass, but were not found in hatchery sediments, so the most likely source for these contaminants is the Yaqui River (where fish were originally collected). The sources of the slightly elevated selenium concentrations in water and fish tissues are likely feed and groundwater. Selenium concentrations could be minimized by increasing water use from Well #4 (which had below detection limit selenium concentrations); mercury concentrations could be minimized by switching to a low trace metal content feed. Potential contaminants of concern at Mescalero NFH are arsenic, copper, and mercury. Again, switching to a low trace-metal content feed would probably be the simplest way to reduce fish trace metal body burdens of arsenic and mercury. These elevated trace-metal concentrations could adversely affect fish health, and, based on the limited data collected for this study, arsenic may pose a risk to anglers consuming large numbers of fish stocked at Isleta lakes. Aside from the elevated arsenic concentrations in fish at Mescalero NFH and selenium concentrations at Dexter NFTC, trace-metals do not appear to be a widespread problem at either hatchery.",
