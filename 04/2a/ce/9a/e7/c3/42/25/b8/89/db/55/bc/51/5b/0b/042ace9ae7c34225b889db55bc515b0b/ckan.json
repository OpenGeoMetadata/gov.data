  "notes": " The Microsystem Aeromechanics Wind Tunnel advances the study of fundamental flow physics relevant to micro air vehicle (MAV) flight and assesses vehicle performance in terms of flight efficiency, stability, and control to improve the range, endurance, payload, and maneuverability of handheld aerial platforms. The tunnel is a closed circuit with a closed test section that is 6-feet long with a 3-feet square cross-section. To facilitate a wide range of experiments, the test section is reconfigurable: both sidewalls and ceiling are removed and replaced as necessary. The tunnel floor includes a turntable and optionally mounted model sting with pitch control. A six-component force balance mounts to the sting, providing aerodynamic forces and moments to characterizecomponent and vehicle loadings. The tunnel design results in relatively low levels of free-stream turbulence intensity. A compartment upstream of the test section facilitates the introduction of additional levels of free-stream intensity to systematically study the impact of this variable, which has a significant impact on MAV performance. The test section is surrounded by an optical rail system mounted on motorized linear traverses to support the use of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) and other optically-based experimentaldiagnostic techniques.
