    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this project, the development of a novel panoramic, stereoscopic video system was proposed.  The proposed system, which contains no moving parts, uses three-fixed position cameras equipped with NASA's Panoramic Refracting Optic (PRO) to generate stereoscopic images over a hemispherical work area.  This system will provide an immersive remote environment for robot operation during space missions, enhancing operator effectiveness.  In Phase I, a prototype imager was designed, constructed, and tested.  This prototype was used to record stereoscopic images throughout its hemispherical viewing area.  These tests demonstrated that the system can generate good stereoscopic views for any chosen viewing direction, thereby proving feasibility.  In Phase II we propose to develop an advanced prototype system with an improved optical design that will enhance the system's imaging resolution.  We also propose to couple the system with a head-mounted display, equipped with a head-tracking unit, to allow the user to effortlessly view the hemispherical workspace in three dimensions by simply moving his or her head.  The Phase II project will therefore substantially increase the level of maturity of the Phase I innovation.  The project will culminate in the delivery of the advanced prototype imaging system to NASA.",
