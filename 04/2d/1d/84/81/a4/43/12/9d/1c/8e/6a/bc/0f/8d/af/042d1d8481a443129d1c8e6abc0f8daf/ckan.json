    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Lynntech proposes a novel flow control methodology for airfoils undergoing dynamic stall. Dynamic stall refers to an aerodynamic phenomenon that is experienced by airfoils that undergo rapid changes in the flow angle of attack such as rotorcraft based airfoils, flapping wing technologies as well as fixed wing aircrafts undergoing sudden angle of attack changes. Dynamic stall is inherently an unsteady, non linear and complicated effect that can affect such flight parameters as lift, drag and airfoil stability. \r\nLynntech, along with its STTR partner in Dr. Noel Clemens and Dr. Jayant Sirohi, at the University of Texas at Austin proposes to use novel pulsed plasma discharge based actuators for flow control on dynamically stalled airfoils. Lynntech has more than 20 years of experience with applied plasma physics and 10 years of experience with turbulent CFD modeling. Dr. Noel Clemens at the University of Texas Flow Imaging Research Laboratory in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, who has implemented and tested various types of plasma actuators for flow control. \r\nThe proposed technology consists of pulsed plasma actuators which will induce high velocity airflow within the airfoil boundary layer, thus reattaching the flow. The proposed plasma actuator can achieve high Reynolds number (&gt;5e6) flow control compared to contemporary dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators without relying  on corona discharge / hot plasma technology. Advantages of the system include low power consumption, ease of installation, increased flight stability, reduced drag and higher stall angles.",
