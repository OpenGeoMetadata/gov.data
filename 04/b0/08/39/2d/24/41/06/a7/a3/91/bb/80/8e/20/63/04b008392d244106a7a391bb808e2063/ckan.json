    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The ability to predict the occurrence and magnitude of solar particle events (coronal mass ejections and solar flares) has been elusive so exposure of astronauts and flight electronics to this radiation is a serious concern for NASA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;work&amp;nbsp;focuses on exposure of operational flight electronics to solar particle events, which can jeopardize human safety.&amp;nbsp; The NOAA Space Weather Scale uses the terminology &amp;ldquo;Solar Radiation Storms&amp;rdquo; to describe solar particle events and categorizes the level of event severity on a scale from S1 (Minor) to S5 (Extreme).&amp;nbsp; The size of these events spans orders of magnitude and therefore the resulting exposure to energetic particle radiation can cause a wide range of effects depending on the severity of the event.&amp;nbsp; For an S1 level event the effect on satellite operations according to the NOAA scale would be &amp;ldquo;none&amp;rdquo; while for an S5 level event &amp;ldquo;satellites may be rendered useless, memory impacts can cause loss of control, may cause serious noise in image data, star-trackers may be unable to locate sources; permanent damage to solar panels possible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end result of this IRAD will be a &lt;strong&gt;quantitative&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;nowcasting&amp;rdquo; tool for solar storms with classification of the severity of the storm according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale for ease of interpretation by mission operations.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This would be used by mission operations as input for making decisions on whether systems and instrumentation should be shut down during an event.&amp;nbsp; These decisions would be driven by the particular features and susceptibilities of each spacecraft and its payload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FY13 will be dedicated to development and verification of the quantitative aspects of the model techniques.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Short term predictions of solar storms will be verified based on space data taken by the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and the CRaTER instrument on the LRO spacecraft.&amp;nbsp; The latter is in an approximately 50 km circular lunar orbit.&lt;/p&gt;",
