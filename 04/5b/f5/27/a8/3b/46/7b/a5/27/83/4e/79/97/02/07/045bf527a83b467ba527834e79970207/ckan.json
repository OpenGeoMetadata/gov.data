    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Planetary rocks, soils, liquids and atmospheric gases are ideal targets for scientists to study the possibility of life existence and the habitability, nature and evolution of planetary systems. Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies to analyze planetary samples. The use of multiple instruments increases the weight, complexity, power consumption as well as the probability of system malfunction. It is critical to develop lightweight miniaturized multi-functional sensor to enable NASA's multiple-mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources by reducing the cost, size, and the number of instruments. Crystal Research Inc. (CRI) proposes a novel compact optical sensor with multiple in-situ sensing capabilities for measurements of various inorganic and organic samples for planetary study and search of biomarkers. The proposed technique is based on a nonlinear coherent interaction process to detect the backward spectral signals from the targets. The detection is enabled by using our novel electro-optic (EO) switchable spectral filtering technique to eliminate spectral artifacts and nonresonant background. The standoff scheme facilitates the implementation of multiple measurements by using a single sensor for nondestructive analysis of different samples on land surface or in atmosphere. It eliminates the sample preparation process, contamination and other related accessories.",
