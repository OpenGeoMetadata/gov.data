    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;A key technical difference (aside from the differences in toxicity) between Hydrazine and the green propellant alternatives is the combustion temperature.&amp;nbsp; Both types of propellants are dispensed from their feed tanks through a catalyst material.&amp;nbsp; The catalyst decomposes (reacts) with each propellant and creates the high temperature exhaust gases that are used to either provide thrust (in the application of a rocket engine) or to spin the turbine which provides power to an APU or EPU.&amp;nbsp; Hydrazine decomposes at 900 deg C while the green propellants decompose at 1600 deg C.&amp;nbsp; However, the existing H-70 catalyst (Shell 405) works best with dual-bonded nitrogen mixtures.&amp;nbsp; Both ADN and HAN offer this dual-bonded feature.&amp;nbsp; Although the green propellants may burn hotter with their own proprietary catalyst material, they will burn cooler with the Shell 405 product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both propellants are mixed with water and the water content can be increased to further reduce combustion temperatures.&amp;nbsp; For this proposal, KSC will ship their green sensors (either for ADN or HAN) to MSFC and we in turn would instrument the EPU dedicated to that propellant.&amp;nbsp; Following completion of one month of testing the EPU instrumented with leak detection sensors, the hardware would be shipped to DFRC for a ground test inside an F-16 aircraft.&amp;nbsp; For the chosen aircraft, the existing H-70 system would be temporarily replaced with the MSFC provided green propellant EPU and the aircraft would be suspended off the ground (jacked) to simulate an engine failure and resultant use of the EPU.&amp;nbsp; The objective would be to show that the landing gear could be deployed and aero control surfaces would properly move to pilot commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative approaches to providing power to an APU include an external gas blowdown system, a Lithium Ion battery driven motor or a thermal battery driven motor.&amp;nbsp; All of these approaches have some drawbacks.&amp;nbsp; An external gas blowdown system may employ the use of a stored gas, most likely Helium, to drive the APU turbine.&amp;nbsp; The primary disadvantage to this system is the mass and volume required to store the compressed gas.&amp;nbsp; A similar approach that would minimize the mass and volume is to use gaseous Hydrogen tapped off a liquid propellant rocket engine.&amp;nbsp; However, APU checkouts would be problematic without the engine in operation.&amp;nbsp; An additional system would be required to provide the gas for checkout purposes.&amp;nbsp; In addition, future launch system elements may not have direct access to the liquid rocket engine and would require a disconnect for staging adding to its complexity.&amp;nbsp; Lithium Ion batteries require many cells that must be matched which drive the weight and costs.&amp;nbsp; The disadvantage of thermal batteries lies in its operation or turnaround.&amp;nbsp; For APU checkouts, an external power source is required and in the event of a launch abort or scrub, these batteries must be replaced.&amp;nbsp; These green propellants provide a high power density packaged power source that can be started multiple times with minimal effects on turnaround from issues presented.&amp;nbsp; In addition, this propellant could not only provide a propellant source for APU&amp;rsquo;s but also launch vehicle roll control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
