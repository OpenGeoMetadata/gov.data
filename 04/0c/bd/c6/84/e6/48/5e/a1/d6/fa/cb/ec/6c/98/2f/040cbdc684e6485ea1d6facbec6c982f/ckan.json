    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR effort will take the first step in improving the existing Medipix dosimeter technology in terms of advancing the technique now used to couple the actual sensitive detector material to the underlying readout electronics.  Prototypes of current Medipix2-based devices have been developed using \"bump-bonding\" techniques, and we will improve this design by employing direct epitaxial deposition of the detector layers onto the Medipix2 wafers.  This will allow us to deploy very specialized detector structures within the detector layers that can enhance the efficiency and resolution of the device for neutron detection, as well as improving both the charge and energy resolution for charged particles.  This includes the application of high hydrogen content polymer coatings to enhance neutron sensitivity.  The epitaxial technique will also produce more mechanically robust detectors and potentially avoid one of the significant failure modes for such hardware, namely loss of contact at the bump-bonding sites.  Versions of the current bump-bonded prototypes exist that are essentially the size of a typical USB Flash-Memory plug-in device, and like those \"USB-Smart-Drives,\" these prototypes can be fully powered and read-out electronically via standard USB interfaces such as found on most current laptop computers",
