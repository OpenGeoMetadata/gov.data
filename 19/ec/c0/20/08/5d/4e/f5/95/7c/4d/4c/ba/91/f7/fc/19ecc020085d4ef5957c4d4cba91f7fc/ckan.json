    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The ssLAPSS expands on the SOP LAPSS by upgrading the light sources to enable future solar cell technologies while maintaining all of the current, proven calibration and test methods.  The ssLAPSS enables testing of current SOP 3-junction cells and also upcoming 4- and 6-junction solar cells. The ssLAPSS uses planar arrays of 6 different wavelength LEDs located in close proximity to the string under test in the solar array.  The individual LED intensity control gives great flexibility to meet power and spatial uniformity requirements.\r\n\r\nThe LED sources are selected to each illuminate one junction in a 6-junction cell.  The same LEDs will also be used for 3- and 4-junction cells.  This means that one ssLAPSS can measure the current (3-junction) and future (4- and 6-junction) cells.  This technology is also highly flexible so that cells with an even greater number of junctions or cells with different spectral divisions could be measure by producing a ssLAPSS with a greater number of LEDs or a different spectral mix of LEDs in the illumination array.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing 3-, 4- and 6-junction cell capability at lower systems costs than the SOP LAPSS, the ssLAPSS also has many other benefits: it requires minimal clean room floor space, it can provide low light levels (LILT), it can measure arrays in horitozontal orientations, it can scale to any bus voltage or string length, it uses proven standards and test methods and it provides for easier calibration than the SOP LAPSS.\r\n\r\nFour- and 6- junction LAPSS technology is necessary to evaluate, test and fly advanced solar cell technologies.  The ssLAPSS extends an essential, proven measurement method to the future of space power conversion technologies.",
