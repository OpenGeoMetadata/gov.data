    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Intelligent Automation, Inc. and its sub-contractor, Purdue University, propose to develop a power-efficient miniaturized reconfigurable EVA radio system with built-in 3D navigation capability. It uses the state-of-the-art RF MEMS and software defined radio (SDR) technologies to achieve extreme miniaturization, power saving, and reconfigurability. Its 3D navigation function is based on proven pseudo Doppler and monopulse direction finding techniques. The wireless communications and navigation functions share the same S-band signal (2.4~2.483 GHz) and can operate up to 10km with position accuracy of 300 meters (3 sigma). The radio is designed to work with a mobile ad hoc network so the coverage for communications can be increased indefinitely by adding more nodes. This radio system can be used for transmitting voice, telemetry, and video among fixed and mobile asset, including lunar/Mars base stations, landers, habitats, rovers, and astronauts. Modern FPGA devices are bridging the gap between high speed digital design and DSP implementation. The SDR based architecture allows the radio to support multiple bandwidth, waveforms, and energy profiles, even those developed after the mission began, via cognitive middleware.  The MEMS tunable filters proposed is based on miniaturized evanescent mode cavities, which are 95&#37; smaller than conventional cavities and are capable of providing very high Q and excellent tuning range.",
