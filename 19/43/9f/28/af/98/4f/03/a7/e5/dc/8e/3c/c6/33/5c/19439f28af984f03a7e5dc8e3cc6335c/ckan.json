    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The purpose of this SBIR program is to adapt NanoSonic's HybridSil&amp;#174; nanocomposites and combine high erosion resistance, low ice adhesion, and passive anti-icing functionality with Metal Rubber sensor technology to enable in-flight icing measurement and mitigation for next generation aircraft.  \r\n\r\nDuring Phase I, NanoSonic successfully demonstrated novel sensor design concepts coupled with HybridSil&amp;#174; low ice adhesion passive anti-icing nanocomposite coatings.  NanoSonic realized outstanding passive icing protection through icing wind tunnel testing, completely preventing ice formation in select conditions and with excellent ice shedding measured to -20&amp;#176;F.  Low ice adhesion with outstanding erosion resistance was realized, retaining low ice adhesion properties following 500 mph rain erosion exposure.  NanoSonic demonstrated exceptional icing event sensing capabilities in the icing wind tunnel, responding in near real time to environmental condition changes with negligible drift or hysteresis in test conditions spanning -4 to 26&amp;#176;F, 100 to 200mph windspeeds.   Sensitivity to observe ice accretion onset and build, with distributed sensing of thickness and airspeed, was demonstrated in near real time.\r\n\r\nNanoSonic will build on these results to optimize, qualify and transition the technology through extensive development, testing, and prime partner interaction during Phase II.",
