  "notes": "The following comments should be viewed keeping in mind that this work was meant as a preliminary survey. We hope that this is the beginning of a cooperative effort by the various agencies involved and that sources of potential problems can be identified and prompt corrective measures taken. A biennial sampling program is desirable and in the interest of the State of New Hampshire and other states within the river basin. According to Sloan (1983) cadmium levels in the tissue higher than 0.1 ppm results in adverse reproductive effects. Levels higher than this value were observed in two species at West Lebanon (See Table III). Eisler (1986a) gives a value of 0.8 ppm as presumptive evidence of chromium contamination. This level was exceeded in smallmouth bass from stations 4 (Brattleboro) and 5 (below the Ashuelot River); yellow perch from station 3 (Claremont); white perch from station 5 (below the Ashuelot River); white sucker from station 3 (Claremont); and chain pickerel from station 5 (below the Ashuelot River). From the available information it is not possible to determine the effects these levels are having in the biota. Lead does not appear to represent a problem in the samples taken since none exceeded the 1 ppm value reported by Rompala et al (1984) as representing a contaminant problem. Mercury levels of 1.1 ppm in tissue should be regarded as evidence of an environmental problem according to Eisler (l987a). None of the samples taken for this work reach this value. The National Academy of Science has set 0.5 ppm total PCBs as the max concentration in fish for the protection of fish-eating wildlife. This value was exceeded in samples taken from Claremont, Brattleboro, and below the Ashuelot River. PAHs do not appear to be a problem in biota taken from the Connecticut River. Total DGT values should not exceed 1.0 ppm in tissue according to the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering. Samples in this survey do not exceed this value. In summary, cadmium exceeds acceptable levels at West Lebanon; PCBs exceed acceptable levels at Claremont, Brattleboro, and below the Ashuelot River; and chromium exceeds acceptable levels at all stations. It is recommended that further work be done which would involve taking more fish samples and sediments as well. Individual rather than composite samples are more desirable.",
