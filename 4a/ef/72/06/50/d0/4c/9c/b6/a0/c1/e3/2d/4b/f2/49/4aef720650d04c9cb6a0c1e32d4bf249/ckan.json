    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Multichannel virtual reality visualization is the future of complex simulation with a large number of visual channels rendered and transmitted over high-speed networks like National LambdaRail (NLR).  POC proposed to develop a next generation \"true\" 3D visualization system that works without headwear and to link it through the NLR with a remote computing center.  To accomplish this goal we have developed in Phase I a fully functional 3D Multichannel Networked (3DMCN) system based on stereoscopic principles and compatible with the NLR network.  One of the enabling technologies that is being developed in this project is multicorrelated channel video compression, which takes advantage of spatial redundancy in multiscopic channels.  The Phase I demonstration included stereoscopic 3DMCN system linked to live real-time high definition (1080i) dual-channel video.  In Phase II we will continue the development of a new compression scheme that can offer 200-300&#37; improvement in compression ratios for multiscopic channels versus independent channel compression used in other state-of-the-art compression approaches.  We will also concentrate on the improvement of the existing true 3D visualization system in terms of higher resolution, lower channel-to-channel crosstalk, and wider field-of-view.",
