    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set reports soil moisture expressed as volumetric water content (VWC), daily precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, and dew point measurements conducted at the Seca Floresta site, km 67, Tapajos National Forest, Brazil. The measurements were part of the Rainfall Exclusion Experiment (REE) established to study the response of a humid Amazonian forest to severe drought.VWC was measured with continuous high-resolution frequency-domain reflectometry to 11-m depth in two 1-ha plots from 1999 to 2007. One plot was subjected to ~75 percent throughfall exclusion during the rainy season (exclusion) and another monitored under normal conditions (control). Daily precipitation was measured in the control plot and in a nearby clearing between 1999 and 2006 using wedge rain gauges. Air temperature, relative humidity, and dew point were measured along the vertical forest profile of the control and dry plots of the site between 2000 and 2003.There are three comma-delimited data files (.csv) with this data set.",
