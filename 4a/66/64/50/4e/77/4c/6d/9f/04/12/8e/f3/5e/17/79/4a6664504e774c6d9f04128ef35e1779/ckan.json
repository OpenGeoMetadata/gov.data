    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The technical objectives of this program are: (1) to develop a set of physics-based modeling tools to predict the initiation of hot corrosion and to address pit and fatigue crack formation in Ni-based alloys subjected to corrosive environments, (2) to implement this set of physics-based modeling tools into the DARWIN probabilistic life-prediction code, and (3) to demonstrate corrosion fatigue crack initiation and growth life prediction for turbine disks subjected to low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue loading in extreme environments.  This technology will significantly improve the current ability to simulate and avoid corrosion fatigue failure of engine disks or metallic structural components due to prolonged exposure to extreme environments at elevated temperatures.  Completion of the proposed program will provide probabilistic corrosion fatigue crack growth life assessment software tools for structural components subjected to aggressive hot corrosion environments.  Such a suite of software tools is unique and is urgently needed for designing and improving the performance of critical structures used in the space structure and propulsion systems in commercial and military gas turbine engines, and oil and gas industries.  This generic technology can also be used to provide guidance for developing new alloys or improving current Ni-based alloy designs for hot-section applications.",
