    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Innovators working to revolutionize air travel through personal aviation pioneers need innovative aircraft design tools.  Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) is an aircraft geometry tool for rapid evaluation of advanced design concepts.  VSP will be extended to include support for the modeling of aircraft structural layout and a modular system for integrating engineering analyses.  These modifications will allow VSP to unify geometry, aerodynamics, and structures in the early design of advanced concepts.  VSP will be released as open-source; a community for its development will be initiated and fostered.  Open distribution will ensure that VSP is available to all, thereby supporting personal aviation innovators, universities, NASA, and the whole aerospace industry.  This will enable a new level of fidelity and accuracy in personal aircraft design needed to meet the aggressive goals required for the success of personal air vehicles.  An improved and open VSP will catalyze personal aviation by supporting breakthroughs in noise and cost reduction and ease of operations.",
