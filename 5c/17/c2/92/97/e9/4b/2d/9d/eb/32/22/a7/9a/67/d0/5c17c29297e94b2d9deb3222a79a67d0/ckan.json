    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This project addresses two vital problems for long-term space travel\r\nactivities: radiation shielding and hydrogen storage for power and propulsion.  While both problems have been studied for many years, there is currently no satisfactory technology for providing adequate non-parasitic shielding.  Even in low-Earth orbit, astronauts must be closely monitored for radiation exposure, and some missions simply cannot be performed due to the current inability to adequately shield astronauts (e.g. Mars or surface Lunar bases).  The overall objective of the proposed project is to implement a new manufacturing technique for the fabrication of monolithic sorbent modules for hydrogen storage and radiation shielding.  We will evaluate the resulting  \r\nprocess for quality control in terms of shape and size consistency.   \r\nWe will work with Boeing on component and system characterization of elemental composition, mechanical strength, and other functional properties.  AFR will explore, in partnership with ATMI, an alternate commercialization strategy, described in the proposal.  During the process and product assessment, we will coordinate possible commercial ventures with Boeing and ATMI.  Previously, a prototype system was operated at two accelerators, demonstrating both operational effectiveness and the ability to significantly reduce the energy of high energy particles (48 GeV Ti ions and various energy protons).\r\n",
