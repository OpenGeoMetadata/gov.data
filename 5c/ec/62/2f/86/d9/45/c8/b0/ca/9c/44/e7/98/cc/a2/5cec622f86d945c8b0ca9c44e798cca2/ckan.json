During short time periods (typically during full moons), fish will aggregate to spawn at discrete locations along a coral reef tract. Locations of historical spawning aggregations in the Florida Keys Reef Tract were collected through interviews with fishermen and review of the scientific literature. Field assessments are conducted during predicted spawning times, typically during full moon periods in the winter, spring and summer.",
