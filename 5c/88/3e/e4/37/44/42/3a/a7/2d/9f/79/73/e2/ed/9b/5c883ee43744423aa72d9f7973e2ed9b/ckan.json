  "notes": "A total of eight Double-crested Cormorant and 10 Black-crowned Night-Heron eggs from Shooter's Island and the Isle of Meadows, respectively, were submitted for residue analysis. Among the dioxins and furans included in the dioxin scan, 2,3,7,8 TCDD was the only analyte that occurred in more than half of the samples analyzed. 2,3,7,8 TCDD occurred in detectable levels in every cormorant egg collected from Shooter's Island (min. = 46.5 pg/g; max. = 161 pg/g), and in eight of the ten heron eggs collected from the Isle of Meadows (min. = non-detected; max. =86.8 pg/g). Concentrations of all other compounds included in the Dioxin Scan were below the level of detection, with the exception of OCDD. OCDD was detected in two of the 10 Black-crowned Night-Heron egg samples analyzed. Because OCDD was detected in less than 50 percent of the samples, it was excluded from further consideration. In order to assess the potential for adverse effects in fish-eating birds in the New York Bight due to exposure to TCDD, a comparison of several toxicity threshold concentrations can be made to the levels found in the cormorant and heron eggs collected. These include the: (1) lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) in sensitive avian species; (2) documented effects in populations of wild birds; and, (3) 50 percent embryonic mortality (or LD50 - \"Median Lethal Dose; the quantity of a chemical compound which, when applied directly to test organisms, is estimated to be fatal to 50 percent of those organisms under the stated conditions of the test\" (Hodgson and Levi, 1987). The concentration of TCDD in heron eggs collected from the Isle of Meadows exceed the LOAEL on average by 1.34 times, was 0.27 times as great as the effects level for wild birds (50 pg/g), and was 0.09 times as great as the LD50 reference threshold value (147 pg/g). From the results of this survey and the above comparison, cormorants appear to be more at risk given the higher mean TCDD levels in their eggs. One reason for this difference may be due to the location of the two sample sites relative to dioxin contaminated sites (which would influence the foraging areas used by nesting birds thus affecting relative exposure). Or more likely, the difference is related to the dietary habits of the two species, cormorants being nearly obligate fish feeders and night-herons feeding more broadly and opportunistically in aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats (Parsons Per. Comm.). Since non-ortho and mono-ortho-chloro substituted PCBs may constitute a large percentage to the total PCBs measured, a greater risk to fish-eating birds in the New York Bight exists than was addressed in this survey. Additional study to investigate possible effects resulting from TCDD and other PCH exposure for the area is warranted. Future studies should incorporate dioxin-like PCBs in the analytes tested for to account for the possibility of additional toxicity based on an evaluation of TEQ.",
