  "notes": "This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model.  This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI).  This is then adjusted as a function of the  ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI.   Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meteorological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not available at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").
