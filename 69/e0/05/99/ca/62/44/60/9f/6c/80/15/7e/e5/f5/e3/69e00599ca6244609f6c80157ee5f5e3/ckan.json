    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA will return to the IIS by 2014 and the moon by 2020.  To accomplish these missions, NASA will exploit to the maximum degree possible the Apollo architecture and especially the lessons learned and technological advances that have occurred over the intervening 40 years in building robust, cost effective, efficient, and, partly reusable launch, lander, explorer, and resupply vehicles.  In support of this effort, Technology Assessment &amp; Transfer (TA&amp;T) proposes to develop a magnesium metal matrix composite (MMC) for use as aerospace structural members.  This material exhibits three times the specific stiffness of the best aluminum-lithium alloys and two times that of PMCs.  TA&amp;T will demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of a low temperature method for achieving high loading of ceramic particles in a magnesium matrix that will enable a cast or extruded structural material of non-uniform cross-section exhibiting the unusual combination of light weight, high specific stiffness and strength, radiation shielding, and low cost.  The MMC will be protected from corrosion by a unique thin film coating designed specifically to prevent corrosion of aluminum and magnesium alloys.",
