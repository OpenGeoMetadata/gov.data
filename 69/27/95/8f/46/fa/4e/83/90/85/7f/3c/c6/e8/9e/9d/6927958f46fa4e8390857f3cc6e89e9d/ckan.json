    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The physical difficulty of designing entry vehicles originates from the\nlarge degree of coupling between the various disciplines involved in the\ndesign.  Every subsystem design decision has far reaching consequences\nthat must be evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion in order to assess\nthe impact on the weight and the performance of the entire vehicle.  The\ndisciplines which must be accounted and integrated during the design\nare: trajectory optimization, guidance, navigation, and control\n(GN&amp;amp;C) technology, aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics,\nthermal-structural analysis, and thermal protection system (TPS)\ndevelopment.  Previous efforts in developing a collaborative or a\nmultidisciplinary optimization process never considered how uncertainty\nin the atmospheric conditions, in the entry parameters of the vehicle,\nin the condition of the vehicle during entry, and in the performance of\nthe TPS will influence the design and provide a risk assessment for a\nmission.  The proposed project will fill this void by developing a tool\nfor multidisciplinary optimization under uncertainty (MDO-U) for entry\nvehicle design.  The proposed development will consider how\nuncertainties influence the modeling results of each discipline, and how\nuncertainties influence the interaction between disciplines and the\noptimal solution.  Finally, the new MDO-U design tool will compute the\nsafety level for the optimum design.",
