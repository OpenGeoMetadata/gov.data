  "notes": "The River Kilometer Index (RKI) Stream Trace Files are a set of arc covers representing centerlines of stream traces for Minnesota rivers. Digitizing was done by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 1980-81. The base maps for the project were USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle maps where they were available, and 1:62,500 maps where the 1:24,000's had not been completed. Digitizing was done in PIOS, the ESRI predecessor to Arc/INFO. Before beginning this project, DNR obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency digital river trace files of major rivers which had been automated by an EPA contractor in an early attempt to build a REACH file. DNR used these base files, dating from the mid-1970's, then digitized in any tributaries appearing on the 1:24,000 or 1:62,500 base maps which were not on the EPA files. LMIC converted the files from their original PIOS format into ARC/INFO format in 1984. Stream traces are stored in coverages by DNR major watershed (corresponding to USGS 8-digit HUC codes). A secondary coverage stores only the trace of the major river in each major watershed. A companion set of files - the RKI Mile Point files, stores mile points for each stream trace.",

Therefore, the file cannot be used for network applications without further processing. 2.

The digitization of tributary rivers more closely matches the linework on the base maps.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
