    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Thermal analysis is increasingly used in the engineering of spacecrafts at every stage, including design, test, and ground-operation simulation. Currently used high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools at NASA are computationally prohibitive and not fully compatible with integrated analysis of spacecrafts. We propose to develop and demonstrate an innovative Model Order Reduction (MOR) software to automatically generate nonlinear reduced thermal models for spacecraft analysis. The underlying principle of our approach is to project the original full models onto a characteristic, low-dimensional subspace, yielding reduced models with markedly low computational orders. \r\n\r\nDuring Phase 1, key technology elements were developed and proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated. A MOR engine encapsulating carefully selected nonlinear MOR algorithms, a reduced model solver and a verification module along with facile data exchange interfaces, were developed in an integrated software environment. By way of whole-satellite (LISA) case studies, critical evidence was established that reduced thermal models enable unprecedented speedup (10500X) and accuracy (&lt;0.3&#37;) for spacecraft analysis and design. In Phase 2, MOR engines will be optimized for enhanced computational performance. Robust constituent linear algorithms and domain-wise projection spaces will be developed to improve simulation stability and accuracy. New MOR capabilities to address variable-dependent models and parameterized MOR to accommodate design perturbations will be investigated. Our MOR software will be extensively verified and demonstrated for complex spacecraft thermal analysis. An application programming interface (API) will be developed in close collaboration with leading NASA vendors (C&amp;R Technologies) to facilitate technology insertion and transition. \r\n\r\n",
