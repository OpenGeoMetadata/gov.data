    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The areal density of solar sails and laser sails is large due to the heavy support structure made of Mylar, Kapton or CP-1. Replacing this support structure with graphene essentially eliminates this mass resulting in a 87&#37; weight savings compared to traditional solar sails, given that graphene is one-atom thick. This weight savings allows for more payload mass, greater acceleration or a combination of the two.&amp;nbsp; This project will investigate if graphene can be used as the solar sail support structure and if significant improvements in areal density can be achieved.&amp;nbsp; The objective of the project is to show feasibility of fabricating light sails by coating a thin layer of metal on a graphene support structure to obtain low area density sails.&amp;nbsp; Graphene is a single atom thick layer of carbon which is invisible to the naked eye. It often comes on a metal substrate such as nickel or copper.&amp;nbsp; The graphene will be characterized by using Raman Spectroscopy to determine the quality and coverage of the surface.&amp;nbsp; Our approach will use the substrate as a support structure by covering the metal on the edges so the middle section is etched away when it is suspended in the etchant, leaving a free graphene layer suspended in air.&amp;nbsp; This graphene will then be coated with a thin layer of metal by sputter coating a 100 or 50 nm thick layer.&amp;nbsp; Another approach will be to first sputter coat the metal and them etch away the nickel or copper substrate.&amp;nbsp; The edges of the substrate will be covered by tape and the middle section will be etched away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Future work will consist of developing low areal density sails with high-reflectivity and high-temperature optimized to enable the highest possible acceleration both for solar and laser sails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both methods were attempted and the second method enabled us to fabricate the sail.&amp;nbsp; Some of the challenges found in the process was the surface tension in the etchant which tended to pull on the graphene causing it to break away from the substrate and float on the surface.&amp;nbsp; Graphene typically has many cracks and imperfections which we believe enabled the material to separate away coupled with the chemical process.&amp;nbsp; After modifying the approach, we were able to make some sail samples which we tested using Raman Spectroscopy.&amp;nbsp; The metal sail layer does shield out the Raman Spectroscopy signature of the graphene so verification of the graphene was not completely possible since the signature was shielded out, but some evidence was apparent.&amp;nbsp; An attempt was made to use AFM to verify that the graphene layer exists and supports the metal layer, but technical issues with the Atomic force microscopy (AFM) prevented us from obtaining results.&amp;nbsp; Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to quantify the optical transmissivity at various wavelengths, which was very low at about 2&#37;.&amp;nbsp; The optical reflectometer&amp;nbsp; was not operational due to a recent failure in the system, so no true values on reflectivity were obtained.&amp;nbsp; Once this equipment is operational, testing will be conducted on the reflectance of the material.&amp;nbsp; The work is significant because it lays the groundwork for interstellar precursor missions for human exploration.&lt;/p&gt;",
