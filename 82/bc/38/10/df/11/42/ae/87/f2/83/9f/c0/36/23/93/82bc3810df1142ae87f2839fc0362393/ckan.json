  "notes": "Anthropogenic inputs of mercury (Hg) into the environment have significantly increased in the past few decades. In conjunction, the current availability of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic systems has increased to levels posing risks to human and ecological health. Risk levels vary considerably in response to MeHg availability, which is affected by lake hydrology, biogeochemistry, habitat, topography, and proximity to airborne sources. We selected the Common Loon as the most suitable bioindicator of aquatic Hg toxicity, based on ecological, logistical, and other criteria, including public valuations of natural resources. Opportunistic and probability-based sampling efforts from 1994-2000 indicate New Englandâ€™s breeding loon population is at unacceptable levels of risk to Hg contamination, particularly in Maine. Based on risk categories developed from the literature and in situ studies by BioDiversity Research Institute and their collaborators, 30% of the breeding loon population in Maine is estimated to be at risk, while 46% of the eggs laid are potentially impacted. Because results from national sampling indicated loons were at most risk from Hg in New England (particularly Maine), we identified several individual- and population-level parameters to better understand the extent of mercury toxicity across Maine. Between 1994-00, we collected 139 abandoned eggs as well as blood and feather samples from 253 adult and 103 juvenile wild loons captured in Maine. The Hg concentrations in these samples were used to characterize sublethal impacts of Hg on egg development, behavior, developmental stability, immunosuppression, individual survival, and overall reproductive success. In the Rangeley Lakes Study Area, a total of 185 loon territories were monitored on 43 lakes during 1998-00. Current monitoring efforts and historical data comprise 515 territory-years measured. Behavioral observations were conducted for over 1,500 hours on 16 lakes with 38 loon territories from 1998 to 2000. Several reproductive measures significantly declined for loon pairs at high risk to prey MeHg availability, thereby corroborating studies in high-risk sites in Nova Scotia and Wisconsin that show Hg impacts reproductive success. Insight into why loons are facing Hg-based population declines can be seen through our hazard assessment process that is based on a weight of evidence approach. Our findings are consistent with other studies linking Hg and lethargy, reduced motivation to hunt prey, and compromised foraging abilities. Continued refinement of model parameters and either a probability-based sampling scheme or new sampling efforts in northern Maine will provide higher confidence in our estimates that will therefore assist in state-based policy efforts as well as national regulations that reflect the ecological injury Hg is currently having on the freshwater landscape.",
