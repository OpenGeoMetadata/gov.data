  "notes": "Organochlorine, trace element, and petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants were examined in sediment and biota from the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas. The study was designed to monitor organochlorine contaminants and provide baseline information on trace elements and petroleum hydrocarbons. The detection of 15 different organochlorine insecticides in a variety of environmental compartments is indicative of the widespread agricultural development in the valley and of the persistence of the pesticides. DDE and toxaphene residues, in particular, were elevated compared to national baseline data. This continues a trend which has been documented in previous studies. The maximum levels of DDE and toxaphene in fish are much lower than the levels found by White et al. (1983) in a study conducted 8 to 10 years prior to this study. The data indicates that DDE levels are gradually declining. The geometric mean in fish was below the 1.0 ppm level recommended for the protection of aquatic life. Several fish samples still exceeded this level, though. The levels of DDE in spiny softshell turtles, which are highly piscivorous, exceeded the 1.0 ppm levels. The biological significance of these residues in turtles is unknown. The DDE levels in fish are sufficient to cause some degree of eggshell thinning in fish-eating birds, but are not expected to cause bird population declines. Toxaphene was detected in fish at levels that have been associated with reduced growth, reduced fecundity and abnormal bone growth. Examining several years of data from station 16 of the National Contaminants Biomonitoring Program indicated that toxaphene residues have not declined like those of DDE. This may be due to the cancellation of toxaphene by EPA which allowed for the use of existing stocks through 1986. Four locations had some of the highest DDE and toxaphene residues in turtles and fish: 1) Llano Grande on the Arroyo Colorado, 2) Laguna Atascosa and Cayo Atascosa before it flows into Laguna Atascosa, 3) the Rio Grande above Anzalduas Dam, and 4) the Resaca de los Cuates. Three of these four locations are bodies of water that have been impounded. Trace elements were generally low in biota, but some fish samples had elevated chromium and copper levels. Three fish samples exceeded the tissue level of 4.0 ppm dry weight which is considered to be an indication of chromium contamination, and six fish samples exceeded the national baseline 85th percentile for copper. Aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes) were found above detection most frequently in spiny softshell turtles, fish, blue crabs, and cotton rats. The highest alkane residues were detected in fish. Both petroleum hydrocarbon and biogenic sources contributed to the concentrations found in this study. The data indicates that biogenic sources were the major contributors of aliphatic hydrocarbons. PAHs were found in five sediment samples. Two samples containing several PAHs. The sample with the highest levels was from the Turning Basin of the Brownsville Ship Channel. The second highest level sample was from an oxbow within the city limits of Brownsville. The levels of PAHs in sediment are comparable to areas that are considered slightly to moderately contaminated.",
