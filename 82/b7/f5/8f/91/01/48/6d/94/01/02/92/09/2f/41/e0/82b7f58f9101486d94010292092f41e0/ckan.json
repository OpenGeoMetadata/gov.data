    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Innovative approaches for broadband multi-function antennas that conserve vehicle weight and reduce drag are welcome solutions for all airborne platforms including suborbital vehicles, where less total weight translates to longer mission times, less expensive payloads, and more acrobatic flight control. The Spectra Research team proposes an innovative approach to accomplishing the program objectives by employing advances in fragmented aperture antenna designs, and Meta-Materials research, in concert with the extensive Spectra Research capability in designing broadband antennas, to develop a low weight, low profile antenna system capable of operation over the electromagnetic region from 10 to 40 GHz. Designs will be addressed for antenna elements that can accommodate either broadband or multiband operation with polarization diversity. The primary technical objectives of the proposed program are to apply the advances in fragmented aperture arrays toward the goal of achieving an innovative broadband reconfigurable array. Extensive research conducted by Spectra Research in the area of fragmented aperture topologies have shown that this technology is ideally suited for applications requiring extremely broad bandwidths (in a reduced footprint) coupled with the capability for rapid reconfigurability of the antenna aperture. Such reconfiguration can accommodate efficient beam scanning, beam forming, and rapid polarization diversity (switching between various polarization modes). A key area of investigation will be into the application of fragmented aperture arrays, meta-materials, and continuously-variable distributed-circuit phase shifters using thin-film ferroelectric technologies.",
