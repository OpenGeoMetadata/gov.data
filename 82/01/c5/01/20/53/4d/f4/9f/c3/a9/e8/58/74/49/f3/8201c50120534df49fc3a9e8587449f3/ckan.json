  "notes": "This GIS layer consists of oil and gas field approximate center point locations (approximately 1,800). Oil and gas fields not assigned a center point by the DNR Office of Conservation will not appear on the map. These points are manually placed into the database as allowing the software to automatically plot the geocenters of the fields may place the point outside the field due to the odd shapes of many of the fields. These data are updated weekly. This oil and gas field approximate centerpoint dataset was processed on January 31, 2007 for the Louisiana 2007 GIS DVD from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) Oracle database/ESRI SDE oil/gas fields file. These data are updated weekly and can be downloaded from the LDNR oil/gas well download site - http://sonris-gis.dnr.state.la.us/website/DownloadLogin.html . Detailed information from the DNR Oracle database for fields can be accessed at LDNR's SONRIS web page (www.sonris.com) in the Office of Conservation Reports - Codes and Lookup Tables.",
