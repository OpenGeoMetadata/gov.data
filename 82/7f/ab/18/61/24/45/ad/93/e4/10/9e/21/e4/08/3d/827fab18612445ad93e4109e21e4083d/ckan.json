    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Nimbus-6 High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HIRS) Level 1 Calibrated Radiances for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) data product contains daily infrared radiances. The HIRS was designed to measure surface temperature and albedo, temperature and H2O profiles, cloud liquid water content, cloud amount and outgoing longwave fluxes in the infrared. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes. The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, also referred to as a binary TAP file, and contain one orbit of measurements.\n\nThe Nimbus-6 satellite was successfully launched on June 12, 1975. The High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) experiment on Nimbus-6 is a follow on experiment to the successful Nimbus-5 ITPR experiment. HIRS scans\n\nThe HIRS was a multi-channel filter radiometer with a Cassegrain telescope before the chopper assembly. The instrument scans in the cross track direction with 21 scans on each side of the subtrack point with about 30 km x 55 km resolution at nadir. HIRS measured radiances primarily in five spectral regions: (1) seven channels near the 15-micrometer CO2 absorption band, (2) two channels (11.1 and 3.7 micrometers) in the IR window, (3) two channels (8.2 and 6.7 micrometers) in the water vapor absorption band, (4) five channels in the 4.3-micrometer band, and (5) one channel in the visible 0.69-micrometer region.\n\nThe HIRS Principal Investigator was Mr. W. L. Smith from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Service. The Nimbus-6 HIRS data are available from August 17, 1975 (day of year 229) through March 4, 1976 (day of year 238).\n\n(These data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC under the entry ID ESAD-00017 together with the merged retrieval data set).",
