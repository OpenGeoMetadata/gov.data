  "notes": " Proteomics Core is the central resource for mass spectrometry based proteomics within the NHLBI. The Core staff help collaborators design proteomics experiments in a way that are compatible with mass spectrometry and to modify protocols if needed to ensure they will provide high quality data. An important aspect of the Core&amp;#39;s mission is to teach users new methods, techniques and instruments. The Core also continually innovates on existing technologies. Our workflows for relative protein quantitation are based on DIGE, label-free and iTRAQ approaches. We can also help investigators identify and quantify protein posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, nitrosylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, etc. We provide training in proper sample preparation and lead the researchers through mass spectrometric analysis to data searching and interpretation. Users have access to a variety of proteomics software platforms (Mascot, Sequest, Proteome Discoverer, Scaffold, Protein Pilot) for re-searching the data or viewing the results. In addition to helping the NHLBI investigators, we develop new approaches for characterization of posttranslational modifications and absolute protein quantitation. The NHLBI Proteomics Core was a recipient of the 2012 NHLBI Orloff Award for outstanding research support.  Recent studies and method development include:  Acetylation on lysine (developing workflows for identification and occupancy measurements) Nitrosylation on cysteine (developing workflows for identification and occupancy measurements) Ubiquitination and SUMOylation (workflows for identification and quantitation) Development of &amp;#39;mito-panel&amp;#39; - using targeted analysis on Velos to follow specific mitochondrial proteins Depletion of the most abundant serum proteins to study the protein differences in patients&amp;#39; samples Absolute protein quantitation using SRM on Velos instruments Development of iTRAQ quantitation software (Quari) and measurement of and correction for isolation purity in iTRAQ Separation of peptides and phosphopeptide enrichment using IEF or OFF-Gel System  Instruments    Mass spectrometers   Thermo Orbitrap Velos Elite 1  Thermo Orbitrap Velos Elite 2  Thermo Orbitrap Excel with ETD  ABI 5800 MALDI-TOF/TOF  ABI 4000 Qtrap   2D-gel setup   Typhoon Scanner  Ettan Spot Handling Workstation  Ettan Spot Picker  Perkin Elmer Liquid Handling Station  Progenesis software programs   Supporting instruments   Three off-line Agilent HPLC for SCX/HILIC  OFFGEL Instrument for IEF separation of peptides and proteins  GelFree Instrument for in-solution separation of proteins   Data analysis   Workstations with Proteome Discoverer, Scaffold, Protein Pilot, Mascot Daemon, ProteoIQ  ",
