  "notes": "The DLG HYDROGRAPHY file is a GIS layer originally created by the United States Geological Survey to represent all surface hydrologic features appearing on the USGS 1:100,000 map sheet series. This current version was converted to ARC/INFO by the Land Management Information Center and edge-matched across map sheet boundaries. In addition, LMIC made some corrections to feature identification, and added state water identifiers to lakes, wetlands, and river features. DNR made further modifications to the files, verified lake feature identifiers, and created a state layer from the separate 100k data sets. Although DNR Division of Lake numbers were added to the file, this coverage does NOT constitute an official 'Protected Waters Inventory' layer: the information is not complete.",
