These locations indicate the reference point that was used as the origin for distance measurements along streams and rivers. This table is referenced by both the FEMA DFIRM Cross Sections, which contains stream station information for cross section, and by the S_Riv_Mrk table (not available on the DNR Data Deli), which contains river distance marker points. The location of the stationing start for a group of cross sections is normally referenced as a note on the Floodway Data table and on the Flood Profiles. Generally, all of the cross sections for a particular reach are referenced to the same starting point. If multiple reaches are measured from the same point, they may share the same record in dfrm_stnstdb.dbf.",
