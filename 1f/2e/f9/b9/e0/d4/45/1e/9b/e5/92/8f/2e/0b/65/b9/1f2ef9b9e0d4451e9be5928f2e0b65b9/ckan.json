  "notes": "HYDROGRAPHY_HIGHRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_USGS.SHP is a line shapefile that contains streams, rivers, canals, ditches, artificial paths, coastlines, connectors and pipelines in watersheds in and around Indiana. HYDROGRAPHY_HIGHRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_USGS.SHP is derived from the high-resolution version of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), which was made available in 2008. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the high-resolution NHD: \"The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",
