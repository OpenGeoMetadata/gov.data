  "notes": "  Raised Floor Computer Space for High Performance Technology  The ERDC Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) develops advanced information technology to address a wide range of engineering and scientific challenges. Located at ITL in Vicksburg, Miss., the High Performance Computing- Research, Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E) Shelter provides 10,000 square feet of world-class, raised floor computing facilities to support the Department of Defense (DOD) Supercomputing Resource Center. High-Powered Computing Capability The HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter houses two of the DOD HPC supercomputers, which require a robust power supply and temperature-controlled environment to run complex operations successfully. The HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter is continuously powered by an 8.2 megawatt power infrastructure with provisions for an additional 2 megawatts of power if required. Chilled water compressors with 2,700 tons of capacity maintain an ideal temperature within the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter. Reliable Execution of HPC Operations To ensure that operations on the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter machines run smoothly and without interruption, the ITL provides a carefully assembled back-up power system. This includes a 6 megawatt Un-interruptible Power System (UPS) connected to a high-speed transfer switch and used only when utility power is lost. There is also an off-line 6 megawatt battery system with provisions up to 8 megawatts, in the event that additional power is needed. Features The HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter offers several innovative features:  A 10,000square foot room of raised floor computer facilities. An 8.2 megawatt power infrastructure comprised of four generators to support the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter and Joint Computer Facility. This infrastructure has provisions for an additional 2 megawatts of power if required. Chilled water compressors with 2,700 tons of capacity support the computing facilities at the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter. A 6 megawatt Un-interruptible Power System (UPS), consisting of an off-line 6 megawatt battery system with provisions to expand to 8 megawatts to support the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter and the ITL Headquarters. Applications High performance computing operations conducted at the HPC-RDT&amp;amp;E Shelter include:  Predicting and assessing severe weather damage. Designing new hydraulic structures. Developing acoustic imaging devices for analyzing structures in turbid water. Engineering critical systems. Simplifying the interface to high performance computing (HPC) capabilities.  ",
