  "notes": "This record is an unpublished report about the history of Native Americans, slaves and freedmen in the Pee Dee. It is a historical report but intended for use as educational material. The goal of this publication is to help teachers better present the unique and diverse history of the Pee Dee region to their students. We have incorporated three basic \"themes' of Pee Dee history - - Native American, African American Slave and Plantation Life, and Postbellum Tenancy. In each we have tried to not only provide teachers with the background to integrate Pee Dee regional material into their classroom studies of South Carolina history, but also to begin implementing a integrated curricula which incorporates math and science. We have tried to encourage the use of higher learning skills - - while still providing plenty of latitude so all students could benefit from the materials. An integrated curricula, while relatively new to many programs, is very simple. It recognizes that our current method of teaching isolates both the student and the teacher from the broad pattern of interdisciplinary understanding. Integrated curricula allow the student to better understand how diverse concepts come together to promote a fuller understanding of the world and essential concepts. By integrating cultural heritage with components of math and science, this program provides a more exciting, and more worldly, view of South Carolina. It promotes a greater interest in both history and other disciplines. It also allows students and teachers to better understand the dynamic relationship between history, agricultural endeavors, and economic factors. It encourages students to understand, not simply to memorize and parrot. This integrated curricula is developed to increase critical thinking and maximize the participation of the student in the learning process. Coupled with a field trip to the archaeological site, students will have the opportunity to not only better understand the history of their region, but also to see that history being uncovered and explored through archaeology. This combination provides students and teachers with a rare opportunity. This booklet is organized to allow teachers to quickly identify the information essential for curriculum development -- maximizing the educational potential of the program. Included is information on the goals and objectives of this program, additional background information to provide teachers with the cultural heritage and history content necessary to teach the lessons, three individual teacher lesson plans, student worksheets, and extension activities. While designed for use primarily in Grade 8, to correlate with the instruction of South Carolina History, these materials have wide applicability. With relatively little modification they can be used in Grades 3-12. Teachers should also be aware that not only does Chicora Foundation offer additional programs and in-class room talks, but the Pee Dee Heritage Center, at Coker College, offers other unique teaching opportunities, including a \"Tobacco History Curriculum\" which traces the history of tobacco from Native American use to the early twentieth century. The Pee Dee Heritage Center can be reached at 803/383-8000 and Chicora's address and telephone number are listed on the title sheet of this publication.",
