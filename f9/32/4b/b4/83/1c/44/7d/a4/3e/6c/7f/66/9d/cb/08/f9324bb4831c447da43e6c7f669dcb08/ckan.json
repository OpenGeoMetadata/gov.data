  "notes": "In May 1995, an initial contaminants survey of Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge was completed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The results of that study combined with ongoing crude oil production activities at the Refuge, indicated that further investigations into the environmental impact of these petroleum production activities on natural resources at the Refuge were warranted. In April 1999, another contaminants investigation was initiated at the Refuge by the Service's Arlington, Texas, Ecological Services Field Office to determine the impact of possible residual petroleum hydrocarbon and brine contamination on macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting three lotic systems within the Refuge. The three streams selected for this study were Big Mineral Creek, Beaver Creek, and Sandy Creek. Surface water, sediment, and macroinvertebrate samples were collected from each of these streams and from Caney Creek, an un-impacted stream located off the Refuge serving as the control. Surface water samples were analyzed for bromide, chloride, lithium and sodium content to determine possible residual brine contamination, while sediment samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene content to determine possible residual crude oil contamination. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from each stream and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The resulting data were compared with surface water quality standards, water quality/sediment criteria protective of aquatic wildlife, and data from Caney Creek to evaluate the potential impact to macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting the streams within the Refuge. The water chemistry analyses from this study indicated that residual brine did not appear to be present in any of the streams sampled on the Refuge. Residual total petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene concentrations in sediments within Big Mineral Creek, Beaver Creek, and Sandy Creek from previous crude oil spills do not appear to be at levels that represent an ecological concern at this time. Considering that the streams sampled within the Refuge contained as diverse macroinvertebrate communities as Caney Creek, it appears that the impact of residual crude oil and brine contamination on the macroinvertebrate communities within these streams is negligible Furthermore, based on the macroinvertebrate organisms inhabiting the streams, overall water quality within these streams appears to range from fair to good.",
