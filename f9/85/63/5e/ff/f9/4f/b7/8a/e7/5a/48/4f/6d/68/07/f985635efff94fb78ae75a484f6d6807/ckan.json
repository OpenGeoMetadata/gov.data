    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of a fully packaged microelectromechanical (MEMS) gyroscope with a 7 milliarcsecond pointing accuracy?sufficient for space and terrestrial telescope pointing applications. This new environmental resistant packaged (ERP) resonant gyroscope will have a small size, weight and power (SWAP) with a mass of around 6 grams and a volume of 3.1 cm3 (fully packaged and with drive electronics) at a cost of ~$500 per axis in volume production. This would be 1/200th of the size and 1/40th of the price of the current state of the art. In phase I, the feasibility of achieving a 0.001 degree Celsius temperature stability will be investigated using the oven control feature of the ERP. This level of temperature control will mitigate the sensor's long term drift (bias drift). In Phase II through some small changes in the gyroscope layout and optimizations in the control electronics, a gyroscope system will be fabricate which is optimized for pointing applications. These optimized resonant gyroscopes will be integrated into the ERP package with its improved oven control capability. The goal will be to transition into preproduction runs after Phase II.",
