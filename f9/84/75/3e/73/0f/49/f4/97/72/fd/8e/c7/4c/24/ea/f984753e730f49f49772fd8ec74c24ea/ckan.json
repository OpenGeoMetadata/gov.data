    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "XABC (Xerion Advanced Battery Corp) proposes a novel anode with three unique features, each designed to 1) control or 2) prevent dendrite growth. The first feature is a 95&#37; porous electrode architecture. This electrode is an open-cell, nanostructured conductive foam whose internal structures are conformal coated with lithium metal. Dendrites growing outward from an internal pore surface will propagate until they come into contact with an opposing wall inside the foam and further growth is mechanically frustrated. This prevents dendrites from propagating external to the anode, as the dendrites would be trapped within the structure of the foam. \r\n\r\nThe second feature is a five micron mask that, when applied to the surface of the 3d foam, prevents electrodeposition of lithium metal near the surface of the electrode, hence preventing growth of lithium dendrites near the surface. \r\n\r\nThe third feature is a novel, highly conductive ionic fluid rigid-rod polymer composite expected to achieve a conductivity of 8.3x10^-3 S/cm^2. This polymer has already demonstrated protonic conductivity of 8.3x10^-3 S/cm^2 and must be modified for use in a lithium ion battery. Rigid-rod polymers have a tensile modulus that is 37x &amp;#150; 62x stronger than a standard polyethelyene solid polymer electrolyte. This strength may physically deter or altogether prevent the growth of lithium dendrites. XABC believes that the novel combination of these three unique features will enable the stable cycling of lithium metal in a secondary cell. \r\n\r\nFor Phase I, XABC proposes to fabricate and test the effect of both the polymer and masked 3d foam on dendrite suppression. For Phase II, XABC proposes to fabricate fully functioning negative electrodes with the features above.",
