  "notes": "Estuarine ecosystems are controlled by a variety of processes that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the hierarchical nature of these processes will aid in prioritization of restoration efforts. This hierarchical Columbia River Estuary Ecosystem Classification (henceforth \"Classification\") of the Columbia River estuary is a spatial database of the tidally-influenced reaches of the lower Columbia River, the tidally affected parts of its tributaries, and the landforms that make up their floodplains for the 230 kilometers between the Pacific Ocean and Bonneville Dam. This work is a collaborative effort between University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (henceforth \"UW\"), U.S. Geological Survey (henceforth \"USGS\"), and the Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership (henceforth \"EP\"). Consideration of geomorphologic processes will improve the understanding of controlling physical factors that drive ecosystem evolution along the tidal Columbia River. The mapping extent is the interpreted Holocene geologic floodplain of the tidal Columbia River and its tributaries to the estimated head of tide. Cultural features within the Holocene floodplain were mapped by visual interpretation of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topography supplemented with aerial photographs and U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. Mapped cultural features are classified as to their purpose when constructed. Because features were drawn based on LiDAR topography, only features with a significant topographic expression are mapped.",
