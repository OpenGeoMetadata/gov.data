  "notes": " FUNCTION: Tests and evaluates high-precision atomic clocks for spacecraft, ground, and mobile applications. Supports performance evaluation, environmental testing, including shock and vibration, and anomaly investigation of on-orbit observed performance. DESCRIPTION: The Precision Clock Evaluation Facility (PCEF) consists of time and frequency reference standards for comparison with test units that are made up of five active hydrogen maser frequency standards, three of which are housed in a large environmental chamber for humidity and temperature control. These references provide uninterrupted precise and accurate time/frequency with a stability of about 1 &amp;#215; 10   -1 5   at 1 day.Theyare maintained in synchronism with coordinated universal time (UTC) as maintained at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), called UTC(USNO), by several independent means. Eight spacecraft cesium and rubidium atomic clock sized thermal vacuum chambers specially designed for short- and long-term testing are used to simulate a spacelike environment (less than 1 &amp;#215; 10   -6   torr) with temperature conrol of 0.1 &amp;#176;C.To support long-term testing in a space environment, the test chambers and time/frequency standard references are operated on a 125 kW uninterruptible power system with diesel backup. Magnetic sensitivity testing of precision frequency standards is performed with two Helmholtz coil systems: a three-axis multicoil system and a single-axis 1.5-m Helmholtz coil. INSTRUMENTATION: Four NRL-built data collection systems are used within the PCEF. The primary atomic clock measurement/data collection system is a 48-channel, dual-mixer phase measurement system capable of simultaneous measurements of 48 different clocks at 20-s intervals indefinitely. A single-channel, dual-mixer phase measurement system used for special evaluations is capable of measurements as short as 0.01 s. These data systems each have 2 ps of resolution. Software used in these systems was designed and coded by NRL, and includes analysis software with graphics and networking support for commercial products.  ",
