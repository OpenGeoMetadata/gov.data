  "notes": "This study, Project ID No. 4N62, was initiated in September 2000. Habitat and fish community assessments were completed at seven sites in the Clarks River watershed in 2000. Composite young-of-year and whole-body fish and sediment samples were collected and submitted (ECDMS Catalog No. 4050036) for analyses. Organochlorine analyses and a metals scan for the fish and sediment samples were performed by the Hand Chemical Laboratory at Mississippi State University and Laboratory & Environmental Testing, respectively. Organophospahte [sic], aromatic hydrocarbon, and aliphatic hydrocarbon analyses were also conducted on the sediment samples. A quantitative mussel survey was performed at Bryants Ford in McCracken County in 2001. Sediment samples were collected at an additional six sites in 2001. In 2002, our efforts included the collection of composite young-of-year, whole-body, and fillet fish samples from the West Fork Clarks River, Blizzard Pond acquisition area, and mainstem. Organochlorine analyses and a metals scan for the fish and sediment samples were performed by the Hand Chemical Laboratory at Mississippi State University, Research Triangle Institute, and Laboratory and Environmental Testing (ECDMS Catalog Nos. 4050057 and 4050058). Organophosphate, aromatic hydrocarbon, and aliphatic hydrocarbon analyses were also conducted on the sediment samples. Although not part of this project, one surface water sample from an active agricultural production area was collected in 2002 and analyzed for triazine herbicides. This sample was intended to be representative of a worst-case scenario of atrazine run-off after a significant precipitation event. A malformed amphibian survey was also completed in 2002 and the results included in a separate report (Lienesch and Alexander 2002). Spatial analysis of wetland habitats within the current refuge boundary was performed and acreages of broad wetland classes determined. Fish and sediment data were compared with current regulatory guidance and toxicity screening values. Biological metrics were also calculated and utilized to indicate the relative quality of the Clarks River watershed. Low residual levels of several chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides were detected in fish collected during this investigation. Mercury concentrations in higher-trophic level fish species (i.e., black bass) exceeded current risk-based levels for human consumption. Chromium, nickel, and arsenic concentrations in several sediment samples exceeded toxicity thresholds for macroinvertebrates.",
