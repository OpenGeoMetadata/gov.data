    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Our Phase I study demonstrated that&amp;nbsp;muons, the long-range charged component of GCR showers, can penetrate SSBs on the order of a km in diameter or less, providing&amp;nbsp;information on their interior structure. Muons produced in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere have been applied to image the interior of large&amp;nbsp;objects, such as the Great Pyramids and volcanos. In Phase I, we found that the production of muons in the solid surfaces of airless&amp;nbsp;bodies is much smaller than in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. Nevertheless, the flux of transmitted muons is sufficient to detect inclusions within&amp;nbsp;an asteroid or comet in a reasonable period of time, ranging from hours to weeks, depending on the size of the SSB and the density&amp;nbsp;contrast, position and size of the inclusion. The intrinsic spatial resolution of muon radiography (&amp;ldquo;muography&amp;rdquo;) is on the scale of&amp;nbsp;a few meters. The spatial resolution that can be achieved in practice depends on signal intensity and integration time, the angular&amp;nbsp;resolution of the muon tracker (hodoscope) and details of data reduction and analysis methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Phase II project will continue to assess remaining unknowns for the application of muography to determining the interior&amp;nbsp;structure of SSBs, assess risks for implementation, and provide a roadmap for development of SSB muography beyond the NIAC&amp;nbsp;program. To achieve our objectives, we will work on four interrelated tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signal and background characterization: Characterize the production and transmission of muons and secondary particle backgrounds&amp;nbsp;made by cosmic ray showers in SSBs;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging studies: Develop methods to determine the density structure of SSB interiors and near-surface features from radiographic and&amp;nbsp;tomographic data;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instrument design: Using simulations and bench-top laboratory experiments, investigate specific concepts for the design of compact&amp;nbsp;hodoscopes that can be deployed on a spacecraft or in situ;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthesis: Determine the range of applicability of the concept, identify the steps needed for maturation of the concept, and explore&amp;nbsp;concepts for a pilot muography mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful implementation of SSB muography requires a thorough understanding of muon production and transmission as well as&amp;nbsp;sources of background. Phase I demonstrated that muon production is sensitive to the density of the top-most meter of the regolith.&amp;nbsp;Thus, unknown variations in regolith density may obscure interior structure. Limb imaging of muons and the use of radar data&amp;nbsp;to remotely map near-surface density will be explored as possible ways to mitigate variations in muon production. A compact,&amp;nbsp;inexpensive system that could be deployed on a spacecraft or in situ appears to be feasible and warrants further study. A successful&amp;nbsp;design must be capable of separately measuring the transmitted muon signal from the primary GCRs and secondary particles that&amp;nbsp;scatter into the field-of-view of the hodoscope. This can be accomplished, for example, using Cherenkov radiators to reject lower&amp;nbsp;energy scattered particles and to determine particle direction. Concepts for imaging systems identified in Phase I will be scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase II will be carried out by a multidisciplinary project team with broad experience in cosmic ray physics, remote sensing,&amp;nbsp;meteoritics and planetary science. While the development of muography for SSBs is risky, the potential benefits are significant.&amp;nbsp;There are presently no established methods to directly characterize the interior structure and macroporosity of an asteroid or comet.&amp;nbsp;Muography could provide a direct and cost-effective means of probing the interior density structure. Such information is important&amp;nbsp;for planetary science, in situ resource utilization, mining, and planetary defense.&lt;/p&gt;",
