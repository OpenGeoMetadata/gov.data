    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of the proposed Phase II research effort is to develop heterogeneous (HG) blankets for improved sound reduction in aircraft structures.  Phase I successfully demonstrated the use of HG blankets for sound transmission suppression and the applicability of the technology to aircraft interior noise control perpetuating a license agreement with a major U.S. Fortune 100 company to aggressively and expeditiously pursue product commercialization.  The highest performing HG blanket resulted in ~5 dB reduction in radiated power from an aircraft test panel.  Reductions are broadband with an effective frequency range from approximately 100 to 1000 Hz resulting in decreased vibration and radiated acoustic levels across this range.  The small 6-10&#37; weight has acoustic benefits far greater than standard mass law effects.  In Phase II attachment, temperature, and installation effects will be studied.  Additionally, analytical design tools will be developed to automate the design process for practicing engineers making it possible to work from basic concepts and application requirements/specifications to achieve a final product which can be readily manufactured.  Together the proven design concepts of Phase I and those proposed in Phase II represent the future in aircraft insulation in terms of acoustic performance, cost, weight, airframe integration, and passenger safety.",
