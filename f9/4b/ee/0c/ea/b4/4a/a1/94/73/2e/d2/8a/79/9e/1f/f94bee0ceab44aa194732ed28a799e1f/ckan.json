    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) Project uses short-duration activities to establish early-stage concept and technology feasibility for high-potential solutions. Internal teams propose ideas for overcoming key barriers associated with large-scale aeronautics problems associated with ARMD&amp;rsquo;s six strategic thrusts. The teams will conduct initial feasibility studies, perform experiments, try out new ideas, identify failures, and try again. At the end of the cycle, a review determines whether the developed solutions have met their goals, established initial feasibility, and identified potential for future aviation impact. During these reviews, the most promising capabilities will be considered for continued development further by other ARMD programs or by direct transfer to the aviation community. In the dynamic environment of new ideas, ARMD also gains significant value from the knowledge gained in activities that do not proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to enable new capabilities in commercial aviation, the CAS Project&amp;rsquo;s focus is on merging traditional aeronautics disciplines with advancements driven by the non-aeronautics world.&amp;nbsp; The Project will draw on external collaborators to supplement in-house NASA expertise in technologies and disciplines that broadly support advancements in all ARMD strategic thrusts.&lt;/p&gt;",
