  "notes": "Mason Valley Wildlife Management Area in Lyon County, Nevada, obtains water from the Walker River, groundwater via fish hatchery effluent and power plant cooling ponds, and municipal treated wastewater for wetland maintenance. The future management goal is to use the wetlands on the Area to treat water from these sources and provide discharge to the Walker River to benefit water levels in Walker Lake without impacting agricultural uses. This investigation was conducted to assess the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality for discharge and to assess the effects of alternative water sources to fish, wildlife, and their habitats on the wetlands. The objectives of this study were to: assess environmental contaminant concerns in relation to water sources and identify those with adverse effects on fish, wildlife, and their habitats; identify risks to humans using the area; document water quality for potential release; and determine if contaminants have the potential to accumulate in the wetlands and associated biota. Data collection in 1998-2000 included: field measurements of water quality in wetlands; chemical analysis of water quality in selected wetlands having different sources of water; chemical analysis of sediment, vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, and fish from selected wetlands; the assessment of plant and aquatic invertebrate community characteristics; and the assessment of fish condition and health. In general, water quality was related to water sources and the position of wetlands in the system. The highest quality waters were in water delivery systems from the fish hatchery, Walker River, and in primary wetlands. Continued monitoring of water quality and contaminants in sediments and biota is needed to properly assess future risks.",
