  "notes": "The primary habitat management objective for the three refuges of the Willamette Valley NWR Complex is to provide high quality forage for wintering Canada geese. To accomplish this, much of the land within the refuge is managed for grass production involving applications of herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers. Other agrochemicals such as insecticides are applied to agricultural land outside the refuge. Some agrochemicals used in the area have the potential to enter aquatic habitats of the refuge and could impact species such as amphibians, turtles, or the federally-listed Oregon chub. The objective of this investigation was to sample both biotic and abiotic matrices and use a weight-of-evidence approach to determine if agrochemicals used on or around the refuge pose a risk to aquatic species. This investigation included seven components: 1) evaluation of pesticide use practices; 2) collection of continual water quality measurements; 3) water sampling; 4) in-situ bioassay; 5) analysis of blood plasma from carp and turtles for endocrine-disrupting compound exposure; 6) fish health assessment; and 7) fish tissue analysis for organochlorine pesticides. The components of the study were used as individual lines of evidence to evaluate risk of agrochemicals to aquatic organisms on the refuge. Multiple lines of evidence create more confidence in making decisions suitable for refuge management because the approach considers all the information gathered from the investigation. By framing the assessment with this weight-of-evidence approach, risk to the receptors of concern and organizational levels is more clearly evident and the information can be used in carrying out the Fish and Wildlife Service mission to protect and conserve natural resources. The results of this study indicate that there are numerous sources of pesticides and fertilizers in and around the refuge, and some of these agrochemicals are entering waterways important to the refuge. The pesticides of most serious concern originate outside the refuge, and refuge personnel have limited ability to manage pesticide application occurring off-refuge lands. However, we recommend several management actions be taken on the refuge to help minimize the pesticides and nutrients entering waterways and to further assess the health of western pond turtle populations.",
