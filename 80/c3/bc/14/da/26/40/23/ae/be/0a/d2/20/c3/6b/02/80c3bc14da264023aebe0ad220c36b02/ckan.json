    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed work seeks to develop and optimize an electrode-less plasma propulsion system that is based on a high power helicon (HPH) that is being developed collaboratively between MSNW and the University of Washington.  The helicon is well suited for this task, as it is known for efficient production of high-density plasmas.  The proposed system takes helicon research into an entirely unexplored regime of high power, moving from the traditional kW level discharges to tens and hundreds of kW.  Preliminary results indicate that it has excellent potential for making an efficient propulsion system with an estimated thrust of about 1 N for 50 kWe.  Higher thrust levels are expected with optimization of its operational characteristics, particularly the addition of a magnetic nozzle that will facilitate conversion of thermal energy into directed flow.  Numerical modeling will be employed to understand the relevant physics, and help determine the optimal thruster configuration.  Scaling studies will determine the power levels where HPH is competitive or surpasses other systems under consideration for NASA?s higher power missions.  Based on results, a plan for the complete system design and test demonstration of the HPH to be realized in Phase II will be detailed.",
