  "notes": "The lower reaches of Mineral Creek, a tributary to the Gila River in Pinal County, Arizona, were thought to be polluted by discharges from ASARCO Ray Mine located adjacent to the creek. Mineral Creek was sampled in 1993 to assess habitat quality and ascertain fish populations and diversity. Sample sites upstream of the mine were characterized by high species diversity (n=5) and abundance. In stark contrast, no fish were captured in the downstream sites. Mineral Creek, downstream of Ray Mine, and four sites on the Gila River were sampled again in October 1995. Both sediment and fish were collected and analyzed for trace elements. Species diversity and abundance had improved significantly in Mineral Creek from 1993 to 1995.Four species of fish were found in Minmal Creek downstream of the mine in l995. Copper concentrations were elevated in sediment and fish. Copper in sediment from Mineral Creek was 40 times the state mean (30 ug/g) and copper concentrations in fish from Mineral Creek far exceeded the maximum level reported from all 117 stations sampled nationwide. Lead and zinc in sediment from Mineral Creek were more than 3-and 4-times the state mean (23.4 and 62.1 ug/g, respectively); however, lead was detected only in a small proportion in fish. Lead concentrations in fish from four sites on the Gila River exceeded the threshold level that could potentially harm fish reproduction and survival. Despite continuing high concentrations of copper, lead, and zinc, in sediment and some fish samples, the overall ecology of Mineral Creek improved from 1993 to 1995. Cleanup efforts by the mine improved ecological conditions of Mineral Creek, and by 1995, four species of fish were present in the area that was nearly devoid of fish only two years earlier.",
