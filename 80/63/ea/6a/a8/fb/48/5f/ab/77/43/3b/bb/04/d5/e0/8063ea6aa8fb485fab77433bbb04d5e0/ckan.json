  "notes": "In the summer of 2011, U.S. Fish & Wildlife staff conducted research to determine nesting effort and success of passerines across varying habitat types at Baca National Wildlife Refuge (BNWR). Two main habitat types were assessed: dry meadows and upland shrub communities. The most dominant plant in the sampled dry meadows was Baltic rush (Juncus balticus). Dominant plants in the sampled sites of the upland shrub communities were rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa) and black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) with an understory containing a variety of native bunchgrasses. Based on research and observations, it appears that when the plant communities listed above are left idle for several years, they decline in plant production and potential wildlife value. Due to the arid environmental conditions and short hydroperiod on BNWR, decomposition of plant material progresses at an extremely slow rate. This can cause a buildup of decadent plant matter, which appears to inhibit regeneration of herbaceous vegetation. Depending on amounts of precipitation and surface water received, these plant communities need periodic disturbance and reduction of decadent plant matter to remain productive, reduce noxious weed establishment and spread, and maximize wildlife habitat value. Therefore, managers use various techniques to modify these plant communities as necessary. Cattle grazing is a commonly prescribed tool, utilized in both the uplands and meadows. Haying practices are also utilized in the meadows, particularly in those that receive high amounts of irrigated surface water. BNWR managers also have plans to utilize prescribed burning as a management tool in these habitat types, although very little prescribed burning has occurred on the refuge to date. One of the purposes of BNWR is to manage for native species with an emphasis on migratory birds. Prior to this study, BNWR managers had little information on native passerine nesting efforts on the refuge. In order to guide and potentially improve management efforts on the refuge, basic information regarding the impacts of various management techniques on nesting birds was needed. This study addresses some of those basic needs.",
