  "notes": "Snappers/Groupers have traditionally been some of the most desired demersal fishes in the South Atlantic Bight and are the most abundant and diverse group of large predatory fishes inhabiting tropical and subtropical coral reefs and rocky reef habitats in U.S. territorial waters. Included in the snapper/grouper fishery management plan is the black sea bass fishery. Black sea bass (Centropristis striata) support valuable recreational and commercial fisheries from Georgia to Cape Cod. The overarching goals of the study have been to determine genetic stock structure and test the assumption that different stocks exist north and south of Cape Hatteras, NC. The genetics work was conducted in Joe Quattros lab on the USC campus. The specific goals of the substudy described here for Dennis Allens work on juvenile black sea bass (collected from 6 estuaries from Apalachicola, FL to Southampton, NY) have been to determine if geographic differences exist for: (1) morphometric and meristic characters, (2) age based on otolith counts, and (3) growth rates based on size and age. Tissue from each individual was provided to Dr. Quattros lab to compare the genetics within and between geographic locations. Together the otolith and genetic data address questions about origins of recruited juveniles relative to offshore spawning populations. Age and growth information could facilitate an understanding of the direction and time of dispersal.",
