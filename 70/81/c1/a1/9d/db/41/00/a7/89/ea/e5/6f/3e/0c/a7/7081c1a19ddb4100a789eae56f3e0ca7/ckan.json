  "notes": "The EROS Image Gallery collection is composed of a wide variety of images ranging from low altitude aircraft to satellite and NASA imagery; oblique photographs and ground imagery are also included in this primarily USGS collection. These images were used in publications, posters, and special projects. They have been scanned, indexed and are searchable for no-cost downloads to the science community, educators and general public. Included in this gallery are the Earth As Art 1, 2, and 3 collections and Landsat mosaics. Also included are special images of elevation data, natural disasters, images that capture natural beauty of the Earth phenomena, and unique perspectives of rivers, lakes, seas, mountains, icebergs, as well as national parks around the world. These collections were developed more for their aesthetic beauty rather than scientific interpretation. Over time, the EROS Imagery Gallery will continue to grow as data sets from the \"Image of the Week\" postings are retired to the gallery. The \"Image of the Week\" posters are scientific observations that highlight current conditions or changes in water resources and land cover over time.",
