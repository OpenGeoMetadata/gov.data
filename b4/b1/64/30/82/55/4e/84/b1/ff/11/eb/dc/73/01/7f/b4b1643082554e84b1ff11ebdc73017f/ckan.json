    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "To address the need to quickly, cost-effectively and reliably develop software to control science instruments deployed on spacecraft, QuickFlex proposes to create a payload control (QuickDirect) software package that can be used by instrument developers as a template for specific missions. QuickDirect will address the generic needs of science instrument control and will provide a template for the control of mission specific detectors and mechanisms. It will contain modules for command &amp; telemetry handling, engineering data collection and monitoring, memory upload and downloads, and software and hardware watch dog maintenance. QuickDirect will contain common command and telemetry interfaces (serial, UART, Mil-Std-1553-B) as well examples of mechanism and detector control modules. QuickDirect provides a template for the development of the specific instrument control software, freeing the QuickDirect user to focus on the interfaces and specialized processes that are specific to the detectors and mechanism, knowing that the generic payload control requirements are fully and effectively covered.  While the software package is designed to operate on a processor platform dedicated to operation of the instrument, the software itself is not tied to any specific operating system or platform.  Notably, QuickDirect will leverage the QuickFlex Reconfigurable Logic Manager (RLM), a set of proven software that enables simple and effective exploitation of the full range of capabilities offered by field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices, including partial dynamic reconfiguration.  The QuickDirect software package will be thoroughly reviewed, tested and documented.  ",
