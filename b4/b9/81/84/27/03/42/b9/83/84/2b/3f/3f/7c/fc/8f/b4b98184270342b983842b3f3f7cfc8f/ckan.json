    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The overall goal of the SBIR program is to develop a new Application Specified Integrated Circuit (ASIC) driver to be used in driver electronics of a deformable mirror (DM) system in order to reduce power dissipation, improve controllability, enhance preciseness, and to significantly reduce the form factors of the entire DM system, thus making it suitable for space-based deployment. A unique capability is being enabled through this SBIR program that allows selection from various DM vendors a best DM to be integrated with the driver ASIC in order to build an extremely high contrast, compact, and low-mass coronagraphs and nulling interferometer system onto a space-based telescope. Given its superior performances namely (1) low power dissipation, (2) high control preciseness, (3) tiny chip estate and low mass, (4) minimal number of needed cables, and (5) universal capability in driving various piezoelectric actuator loads, the proposed ASIC driver technology holds the promise of enabling ultimate deployment of low power, low payload, low cost, and high-performance adaptive optics (AO) systems into NASA's space-based platforms. The feasibility of the proposed Phase II approach is demonstrated through eight major technical objectives: (1)packaging and characterizations of the Phase I 8x8 driver ASIC, and based on the test results, (2) design optimization and simulation of the Phase II 32x32 switch array driver ASIC, (3) layout, simulation verification, and tape out for ASIC manufacturing, (4) packaging and basic characterizations of the driver ASIC, (5) ASIC UBM (Under Ball Metallurgy) fabrication, (6) building ASIC PC communication interface and PC software development, (7) fabrication of capacitive load arrays made of different piezoelectric materials, and (8) characterizations of the final Phase II 32x32 switch array driver ASIC in integration with load/actuator arrays.",
