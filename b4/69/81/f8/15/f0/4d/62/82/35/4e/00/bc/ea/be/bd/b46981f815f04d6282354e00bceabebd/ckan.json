  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides spatially continuous high-resolution surface salinity imagery in a synoptic manner from small aircraft. Its output complements data collected from ship-based and moored systems, puts those data sets into synoptic context, and provides key information for assimilation into predictive models of physical fields including currents, temperature, salinity, and sound speed in the littoral and open oceans. DESCRIPTION: STARRS is an imaging sensor that provides complete areal coverage of surface salinity in a swath twice as wide as the aircraft&amp;#39;s altitude. The swath is resolved into six cells, and swaths can be quickly flown adjacent to each other. STARRS includes advanced primary and secondary measurement components to assure salinity retrieval with total noise levels less than a few tenths of one practical salinity unit (psu) under a wide range of environmental conditions. The dominant force driving currents in the littoral is due to density differences between water masses. These are caused by the flux of low salinity waters from bays and rivers to the coastal zone, and the contrasts between shelf and open-ocean waters. Similar contrasts drive large-scale open-ocean currents. STARRS&amp;#39; capabilities allow researchers to routinely obtain high-resolution imagery in a synoptic fashion. INSTRUMENTATION: In the photograph, STARRS is shown mounted to the underside of a Piper Navajo twin engine airplane. In the center is the 1-m-square multibeam 1.4 GHz L-band radiometer; it is based on a low-noise microstrip patch antenna for the primary salinity/brightness/temperature measurement. At left is a two-channel split-window infrared (IR) radiometer for sea surface temperature. At right is a singlebeam multichannel C-band radiometer for estimates of sea surface roughness. The IR and C-band secondary subsystems provide useful oceanographic information in their own right, in addition to being key inputs for the retrieval of salinity from the primary L-band system.  ",
