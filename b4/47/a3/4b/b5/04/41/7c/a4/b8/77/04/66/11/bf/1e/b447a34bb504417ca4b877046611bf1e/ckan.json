    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase 2 project will produce a software service infrastructure\nthat enables most modeling and simulation (M&amp;amp;S) activities  from\ncode development and compilation to runtime execution and collaboration\nto be performed from a standard web browser across cloud- and\ngrid-enabled computing resources.  By addressing the security,\nscalability and virtualization challenges that have heretofore prevented\nservice-centric M&amp;amp;S from being practical, this first-of-its-kind\nModeling and Simulation as a Service (M&amp;amp;SaaS) platform will allow\nM&amp;amp;S users and developers alike to avoid many of the obstacles that\ncurrently confound the delivery, accessibility and usability of\ntraditional, non-service-oriented M&amp;amp;S software. Building upon its\ncommercial Grid Software as a Service (GSaaS) platform, Parabon\nconvincingly demonstrated M&amp;amp;SaaS feasibility in Phase 1, as well as\nits ability to deliver the M&amp;amp;SaaS solution, completing in Phase 1 a\nPhase 2 solicitation goal of executing a NASA climate model across a\ncomputational grid and displaying the results, all from a browser.  By\nthe completion of Phase 2, M&amp;amp;SaaS will support, at TRL 6-7,\nbrowser-based source code editing, management of distributed\nrepositories, research collaboration via forums and wikis, and\nvirtualized build and runtime environments, all from within richly\nfeatured and access-controlled web accounts.?  M&amp;amp;SaaS has the\npotential to revolutionize how M&amp;amp;S is practiced across many\nindustries  including defense, finance and pharmaceuticals  however, its\nbenefit to NASA could be remarkable.  Because the NASA mission often\ninvolves science that does not readily admit to direct experimentation,\nM&amp;amp;S is often the only means by which to answer significant\nscientific and engineering questions.  The productivity improvements and\ncost reductions enabled via this new service paradigm will help NASA and\nother organizations generate discoveries more readily and realize\nsignificantly higher return on M&amp;amp;S investments.",
