    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Armstrong innovators have developed a highly accurate method for measuring liquid levels using optical fibers. Unlike liquid level gauges that rely on discrete measurements to give broad approximations of liquid levels, Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s novel method provides measurements at &amp;frac14;-inch intervals within a tank. The system uses fiber optic Bragg sensors located along a single fiber optic cable. These sensors actively discern between the liquid and gas states along a continuous fiber to pinpoint the liquid level. This significant leap forward in precision and accuracy in liquid level sensing offers significant benefits to many industries. Designed to monitor a rocket&amp;rsquo;s cryogenic fuel levels, the technology can be used in many medical and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;/strong&gt;: The technology has been demonstrated in multiple environments using conventional validation techniques. First, water level measurements have been conducted to demonstrate operation within a benign environment. Second, liquid level measurements were conducted in liquid nitrogen using a 6-foot dewer. Measurements also were conducted within a liquid hydrogen environment using a 4-foot dewer. The technology performed well in all three cases, demonstrating the ability to measure liquid to &amp;frac14; inch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;: The team continues to push the fields of application with future tests to determine boundary layers between different fluids such as oil and water. Also there are planned opportunities to demonstrate the technology in a NASA-operated cryogenic test bed, simulating a cryogenic fuel management scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precise&lt;/strong&gt;: Can gauge liquid levels within a &amp;frac14;-inch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt;: Requires just one fiber optic strand and one metallic wire, as opposed to conventional measurement systems, which require many more wires&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: Is not susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robust&lt;/strong&gt;: Can be used in corrosive or toxic liquids without damaging the fiber or contaminating the liquid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerospace launch vehicles and satellites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemical and refinery plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industrial tanks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
