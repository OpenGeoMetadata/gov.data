    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Conventional methods of manufacturing automation do not lend themselves to construction of large structures with internal features, especially if various other components (such as reinforcement, pipes, sensors, etc) are to be installed within the structure. This explains why the evolution of construction automation has been slow. While well known in parts manufacturing, a promising new automation approach in construction is layered fabrication, generally known as solid free form fabrication or additive manufacturing. However, most of the current layered fabrication methods are limited by their ability to deliver a wide variety of materials applicable to construction (especially if those materials are local, or in-situ). Additionally, they are severely constrained by the low rates of material deposition which makes them atttractive only for the fabrication of small industrial parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACME project will utilize additive construction expertise previously developed at MSFC and CCI, automation and robotics expertise from KSC, and fundamental construction knowledge developed by the USACE to develop and expand the knowledge base associated with automated construction of planetary surface structures using in-situ materials. Areas of emphasis will include characterization of typical Lunar and Martian regolith materials (using terrestrially-developed simulant materials), optimization of binder materials for each regolith, development of sub-scale followed by full-scale regolith beneficiation and processing, handling and transport and actual mobilitydeposition hardware, and development of automated cleaning processes.&lt;/p&gt;",
