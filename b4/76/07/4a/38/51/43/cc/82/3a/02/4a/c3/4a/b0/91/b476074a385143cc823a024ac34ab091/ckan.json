  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 30x30 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 2003 by the NOAA Ship Little Hales. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, as well as the NOAA Ship Little Hales , and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Charleston Bump from 06/24/2003 to 06/30/2003. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad Single Beam Echosounder. It was processed by interpolating a bathymetrical surface from feature class points using the spatial analyst natural neighbor tool with 9 neighbor cell radius. The raster surface was exported as a 30m GeoTiff. Rugosity was derived from this surface using NOAA's Benthic Terrain Modeler extension.",
