    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Fault detection and isolation (FDI) in spacecraft's electrical power system (EPS) has always received special attention.  However, the power systems health management techniques have generally been limited to the energy sources and storage elements.  Furthermore, these functions have been performed off-line by mission planners for the sole purpose of estimating future energy availability and effective device lifetime.  As new programs and vehicles developed for space exploration, degradation analysis and prognostics in spacecraft EPS are becoming key issues for safety and success of these missions.\r\nQSI propose a novel approach to utilize ISHM decisions to estimate power generation, storage and delivery capabilities, and subsequently using the information for generating optimal reactive mission plans to maximize the mission success probability.  The key innovations in the proposed effort are 1). Utilization of diagnostic, prognostic, and recovery decisions to estimate the power supply capability of a spacecraft EPS and assess its reliability; 2). Development of an automated process to optimally utilize the available power supply capability with consideration for maximizing mission success probability; 3). Generation of optimal reconfiguration options and concomitant control actions for spacecraft EPS by using the onboard reactive planner and universal executive.",
