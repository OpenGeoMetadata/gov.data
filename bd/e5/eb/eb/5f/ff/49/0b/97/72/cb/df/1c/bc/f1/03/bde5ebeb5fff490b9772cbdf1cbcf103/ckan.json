  "notes": " FUNCTION: Prepares and spectroscopically characterizes electro- and photoactive organic thin films. Fabricates and evaluates the performance of organic electro-optic, opto-electronic, and electronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and field-effect transistors. DESCRIPTION: This state-of-the-art fabrication and characterization facility develops organic electro-optic, opto-electronic, and electronic prototype devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and field-effect transistors. Devices are prepared by sequential vacuum vapor deposition of organic and inorganic films on glass or flexible substrates. The deposition processes take place in separate adjacent chambers connected by gate valves. The samples are either rotated from one position to the next, or moved horizontally via magnetic arms. Spectroscopic characterization can take place in situ in vacuum and/or ex situ in a controlled-atmosphere chamber. The facility also provides capabilities for the growth and spectroscopic characterization of high quality electro- and photo-active organic thin films. INSTRUMENTATION: A versatile, high-vacuum, multisurface film deposition apparatus is available for the preparation of organic films and devices. The chamber encloses a large, temperature-controlled (10-450 K) wheel that holds 14 substrates and four quartz crystal microbalances, and up to eight resistive heating furnaces for high-vacuum deposition. A Spex 270M monochromator outfitted with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector is used for spectroscopic characterization. A computerized, controlled-atmosphere experimental chamber equipped with a freezer and a microscope is available for handling sensitive chemicals, and for fabrication and characterization of prototype devices. The chamber houses several pieces of equipment such as an integrating sphere and a luminance meter for material and device characterization. A newly built ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) multi-chamber deposition apparatus interfaced to a controlled-atmosphere chamber is available for device fabrication (up to 5 in. diagonal) and sealing. This chamber will be soon moved and housed in a clean room at the Nanoscience Research Laboratory.  ",
