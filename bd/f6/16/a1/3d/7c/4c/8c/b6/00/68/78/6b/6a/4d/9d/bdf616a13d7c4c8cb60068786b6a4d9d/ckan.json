  "notes": "Issue: Relative Potential Loss of Canopy to Development, Urbanization and Recreation The intent of this issue is to: o Identify the areas at greatest risk of conversion from forestland to other uses-specifically development. o Identify those areas were pressure from off highway vehicle (OHV) use in undesignated areas can lead to degradation of forested areas. This layer was constructed using the following layers: 1. Development Potential The National Guidance suggested using the \"Forests on the Edge\" data developed by Dr. David Theobold, Colorado State University. These data use the SERGoM v3 model, described in the research paper Watersheds at Risk to Increased Impervious Surface Cover in the Conterminous United States, to predict housing density in ten-year increments from 2000 to 2030. By subtracting 2000 housing densities from 2030 predicted housing densities, we can express the potential areas of new development. The Theobold data broke out housing density into ten classes; we modified these to eight classes as follows: 1. No Development or >80 acres per unit (rural) 2. 40-80 acres per unit (rural 1) 3. 20-40 acres per unit (rural 1) 4. 10-20 acres per unit (rural 2) 5. 1.7-10 acres per unit (rural 2) 6. 0.6-1.7 acres per unit (exurban/urban) 7. <0.6 acres per unit (exurban/urban) 8. Urban/built up (commercial, industrial, transportation) When considering the movement from one density class to another, we wanted to make some judgment about the relative impact of that change. IDL Staff developed the following matrix showing values from 0 (no change) and 1 (low impact change) to 5 (highest impact change) and classified the data accordingly. The numbers in the colored boxes represent the housing density classes shown above. So, movement from density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 4 (10-20 acres per unit) by 2030 is considered a very high impact (value of five), A movement from density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 3 (one unit per 20-40) acres in 2030, on the other hand, is considered a high change (value of 4). 2030 No_Dev1 / Rural2 / Rural3 / Rural4 / Urban5 / Urban6 / Urban7 / Urban8 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 No Dev 1 -- 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 Rural 2 -- -- 4 5 5 5 5 5 Rural 3 -- -- -- 4 5 5 5 5 Rural 4 -- -- -- -- 3 4 5 5 Urban 5 -- -- -- -- -- 2 4 5 Urban 6 -- -- -- -- -- -- 4 5 Urban 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3 Urban 8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Table Key -- = no or negative change 1 = low impact change 2 = low-moderate impact change 3 = moderate impact change 4 = high-moderate impact change 5 = high impact change 2. Recreation Pressure from ORV's We used a model developed by the Idaho Department of Lands that incorporated US Census data for population density, the number of ORV registrations by county, TIGER 2000-based streets dataset, and travel distance preferences from 2002 Recreation Demand Assessment by the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation. We used the following assumptions in developing the model: o Census population can be used as a surrogate for overall recreation pressure o OHV registration totals by county can be used to estimate motorized recreation pressure o The public road network is how recreation pressure is transmitted and dispersed to forested lands o Recreation pressure comes primarily from urban population centers within and outside the state: 1. Boise/Nampa/Caldwell 2. Twin Falls 3. Pocatello 4. Ogden/Layton, UT 5. Logan, UT 6. Idaho Falls 7. Moscow, ID/Pullman, WA 8. Clarkston, WA/Lewiston, ID 9. Spokane, WA/Coeur d'Alene, ID o Recreation pressure on a forestland can come from multiple population centers and is additive o Recreation pressure decreases as travel time to a recreation destination increases (actually, not an assumption but confirmed by IDPR recreation demand surveys) o All parts of the state are equally desirable recreation destinations and certain destinations (such as resort areas, parks, etc.) do not attract more recreation pressure than others o Recreation activity is defined as that which lasts a day or less; multi-day recreation activities are not considered The result is a map that shows ORV pressure based on a 1 to 3 hour travel time. Those areas closest to urban areas (requiring less time to get to) were scored highest. Data was divided into three classes, scored 1 through 3. More information on this model can be found by reading the Modeling Recreation Pressure on Idaho Forest Lands. Issue Process: The two datasets were added together, and then stratified into 5 classes (low to high risk) using natural breaks in the data.
