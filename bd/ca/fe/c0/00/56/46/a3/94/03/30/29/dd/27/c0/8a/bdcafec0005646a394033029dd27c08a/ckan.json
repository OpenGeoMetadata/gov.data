  "notes": "The National Wildlife Refuge System is a network of lands and waters managed specifically for the protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat. Refuges are also places where compatible human contact with nature is encouraged. In keeping with this national direction, Parker River National Wildlife Refuge has served both wildlife and people since its establishment in 1942. In its coastal barrier island-salt marsh location along major bird migration routes, the refuge is used by over 300 species of birds. Parker River's extensive salt marshes serve as important feeding and resting areas for peak concentrations of up to 25,000 ducks and 6,000 geese during fall and spring migrations. In addition, the refuge provides habitat for large flocks of warblers and shorebirds, and refuge wetlands are valued as a nursery for fish and shellfish. Over 400,000 people visit Parker River NWR each year. The natural beauty of unspoiled beach and dune, expansive salt marsh, and sparkling water offers visitors respite from the bustle of surrounding urbanization including the developed northern end of Plum Island. The combination of natural and man-altered habitat — salt marsh, saltpans, brush, freshwater pools, and fields — makes the refuge an outstanding area for wildlife observation. In addition to bird watching and environmental education, visitor activities include surf fishing, hiking, clamming, plum and cranberry picking, and hunting. In view of its two-fold mission, Parker River’s central management challenge is to protect its wildlife and natural character while providing an increasing number of visitors with quality recreational, educational, and interpretive experiences. In 1980 a nine-step comprehensive planning process and extensive public involvement effort to document long-range management and development goals for Parker River was initiated. The planning process was accomplished through the cooperation of a Fish and Wildlife Service team of refuge planners, wildlife managers, landscape architects, biologists, resource specialists, computer mapping specialists, and cartographers. The resulting Technical Report describes management measures necessary to retain the natural, wildlife, and human values associated with the refuge. Specifically, this report includes: (1). Background information about the refuge, its management, and the planning process. (2). A summary statement of policy direction and planning issues. (3). Long-range objectives — both quantitative and qualitative — derived from policy guidance, resource capabilities, and use demands.(4) A master plan map based on these objectives that shows functional and spatial relationships between present and potential refuge uses. (5) A phasing strategy and map for achieving the objectives over the next ten to twenty years. (6). A set of Construction Project Worksheets that give a detailed accounting for the major projects required to achieve the objectives. These worksheets serve as a bridge between concept and action.",
