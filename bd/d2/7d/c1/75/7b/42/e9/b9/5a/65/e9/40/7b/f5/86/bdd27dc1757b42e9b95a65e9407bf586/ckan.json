  "notes": "The Office of Emergency Management maintains information relevant to preventing emergencies before they occur, and/or mitigating the effects of emergency when they do occur. \n\nA principal element of this data asset is the information managed by the System for Risk Management Plans (SRMP), which compiles risk management plans submitted by facilities in accordance with the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). Affected facilities are to develop risk management programs which will prevent and minimize consequences of accidental releases of certain hazardous chemicals that could harm public health and the environment.\n\nAnother component of this data asset are the results generated by the Priority Assessment Model (PAM), which analyzes information concerning low-level chronic emissions from facilities and sets priorities (low, medium, high) for proactive controls on releases that do not necessarily pose imminent threats, but which may under adverse circumstances create unacceptable health or ecological risks.\n\nAlso included are inspection records compiled by the Oil Inspection Program. Under the Clean Water Act Section 311, EPA regulates oil storage that meets a specific regulatory threshold. Facilities that store oil and meet the regulatory threshold need to prepare and implement a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan which needs to be reviewed and approved by a professional engineer. Additionally, facilities with larger oil storage capacity may have to prepare and implement a Facility Response Plan. EPA is the lead federal response agency for oil spills occurring in inland waters.\n\nAll other information that contributes to EPA's programs, policies and guidance concerning the prevention and mitigation of emergencies is included in this data asset.",
