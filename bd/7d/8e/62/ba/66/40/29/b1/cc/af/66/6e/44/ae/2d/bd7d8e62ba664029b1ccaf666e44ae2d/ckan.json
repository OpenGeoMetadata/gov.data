    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This effort undertakes the creation of an Airport Ground Resource Planning (AGRP) tool.  Little or no automation is currently available to support airport ground resource allocation decisions.  The AGRP tool provides visualization both of the resource assignments as well as other information relevant to making resource assignment decision.  In addition, AGRP automates or advises resource assignments, improving efficiency while reducing workload.  In Phase 2, we propose to continue development of the AGRP tool through four work areas.  First, we will complete the map and Resource Allocation displays.  We will also complete the algorithm to automate resource allocation decisions and integrate it with the displays.  The resulting AGRP prototype will be evaluated operationally.  We will also extend the Phase 1 work to develop a block out time predictor, which would have tremendous application and benefit in other traffic management systems.  In Phase 1, we proposed an architecture in which applications such as AGRP can subscribe to receive SMS data via a standardized interface.  In Phase 2 we will complete the specifications for and implementation of this interface, which will replace the existing SMS client-server communication.",
