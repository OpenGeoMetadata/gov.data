    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "For NASA's human and robotic mission, the battery with extremely high specific energy (&gt;500 Wh/kg) and long cycle life are urgently sought after in order to reduce the payload weight.  Current state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries, such as graphite/LiCoO2 or graphite/LiFePO4 systems, have limited specific energy to around 220 Wh/kg on the cell level.  In order to meet the future NASA mission requirements, new out-of-box battery chemistries and components need to be developed. \r\n\tOn the commercial side, electric vehicles (EVs) seem to be promising alternatives to replace the internal combustion engines, which can reduce the consumption of petroleum oil and CO2 emission. However, up to date, the lack of suitable batteries with high energy density and excessive cost of the power sources have hindered the development and widespread market penetration of the EVs.\r\n     Driven by the strong market pull, Bettergy has invented a novel ion selective membrane that can be employed along with Li2S based cathode material to develop the next generation lithium sulfur battery. This novel battery is expected to have 1) high specific energy (&gt;500 Wh/kg); 2) long cycle life (&gt; 1000 cycles); 3) long storage life and 4) great safety feature, which can meet the challenge requirements of the NASA mission.",
