    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tMicrocalorimeter x-ray instruments are non-dispersive, high spectral resolution, broad-band, high cadence imaging spectrometers. We have been developing these instruments for x-ray astrophysics for over 25 years and have successfully flown them on both suborbital and orbital observatories. Microcalorimeter spectrometers are true spatial-spectral event-driven instruments. The core instrument for the Astro-H observatory to be launched in 2014 and for the International X-ray Observatory planned for around 2022 [1] are both microcalorimeter spectrometers. For the past two years, supported by the Solar and Heliospheric ROSES program, we have been adapting this highly successful technology to the very different requirements of solar physics. This leverages the large NASA investment in this technology to produce instruments optimized for solar physics with only a moderate development program.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tDuring the past two years, we have developed a high spatial resolution, high cadence microcalorimeter optimized for solar observations with a ground-breaking spectral resolving power of nearly 3000 at 6 keV. This exceeds the performance goals of our program. In fact, the single-pixel performance achieved during this program is already sufficient for a solar optimized instrument as described in section 2, albeit using small arrays of detectors. We propose here to continue this successful program by developing large focal-plane arrays, optimized for solar physics and their read-out systems. This complements our existing development programs in astrophysics, where we have already produced and tested kilo-pixel arrays for IXO. The end-result of the proposed work will be a solar-optimized detector system proven and ready for integration into a suborbital payload and then onto a space-borne observatory. Both the suborbital program and an orbital instrument would allow high cadence spatial-spectral observations across the x-ray band from 0.1 to above 10 keV, enabling new science as described in section 1.4. Ultimately this will produce instrumentation suitable for deployment on an Explorer-class mission and, possibly, a remote sensing contribution to the Solar Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport (SEPAT) Solar-Terrestrial Probe [2]. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
