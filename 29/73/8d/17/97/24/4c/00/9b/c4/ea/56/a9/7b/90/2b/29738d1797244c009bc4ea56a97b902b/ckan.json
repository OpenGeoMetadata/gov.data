    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set includes non-Doppler polar volume reflectivity data from the Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX). Data were collected on Sweden's Gotland Island, using an Ericsson radar mounted at 56 m above sea level. The radar provided 12 scanning angles. Measurements were taken between 1 September 2002 and 31 May 2003. BALTEX data sets will be used for validation of AMSR-E and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)/Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB) Level 1 brightness temperatures and Level 2 cloud and precipitation parameters. Data are available in network Common Data Format (netCDF) from NSIDC via FTP.\n\nThe Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 4 May 2002. The Baltic Sea Experiment's (BALTEX) Radar Data Centre (BRDC), operated by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), collects data from as many radars in or near the Baltic region as possible. During the Main Observational Phase (October 1999 - February 2002), data from 25 radars in six countries have covered the Baltic region every 15 minutes. High-latitude data are recorded from 50 to 70 degrees North, and they complement pre-existing efforts in the mid-latitudes and tropics.",
