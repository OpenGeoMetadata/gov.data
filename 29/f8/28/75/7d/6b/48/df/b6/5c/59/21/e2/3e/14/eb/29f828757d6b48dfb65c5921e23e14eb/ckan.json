    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In collaboration with other Directorates and agencies, ASTEP supports investigations focused on exploring the Earth?s extreme environments in order to develop a sound technical and scientific basis to conduct astrobiological research on other solar system bodies. ASTEP is a science-driven exploration program that results in new science and operational/technological capabilities to enable the next generation of planetary exploration. A unique feature that is central to ASTEP is the use of terrestrial field campaigns to further science and technology and NASA?s exploration capabilities. Proposals that integrate science, technology, and field campaign objectives are given priority. In addition to science:\n - ASTEP seeks the development and application of technologies that support science investigations by enabling remote searches for, and identification of, life and life- related chemistry in extreme environments (including lunar and planetary surfaces). These technologies include, but are not limited to, sample acquisition and handling techniques, sample manipulation, and the use of mobile science platforms (including planetary rovers and astronauts) including techniques for autonomous operations and self-contained deployment systems. (Science instrument technology proposals are supported through ASTID).\n - ASTEP seeks systems-level terrestrial field campaigns designed to address astrobiology science goals and demonstrate and validate related technologies in remote and/or extreme environments on Earth. Field campaigns are conducted with complete systems and in a manner that approximates operations during an actual planetary mission, providing an opportunity to understand the performance, capabilities, and efficiencies associated with the tested systems while enabling human participants to gain operational experience with those systems in the field. \n\nThe ASTEP R&amp;A Lead estimates approximately 20&#37; of the funded effort is technology-related ($1.8M of $9M in FY12)",
