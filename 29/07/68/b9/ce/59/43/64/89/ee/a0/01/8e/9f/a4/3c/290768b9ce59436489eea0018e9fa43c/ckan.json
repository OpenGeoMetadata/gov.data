      "value": "  Neutron Depth Profiling (NDP) is a nondestructive analytical technique for measuring the concentration profile of certain light elements as a function of depth. The concentration profile in the first few micrometers of a surface is determined by analyzing the energy spectrum of charged particles promptly emitted following neutron capture by the element. For an overview, see: Downing, R.G., and Lamaze, G.P., Langland, J.K., and Hwang, S.T., &amp;quot; Neutron Depth Profiling: Overview of the NIST Facilities&amp;quot; NIST Journal of Research, 98(1) (1993) 99. (PDF) Additional publications available upon request.  Specifications / Capabilities:   Technique: Neutron Depth Profiling (NDP) measures elemental concentration profiles up to a few micrometers in depth for elements that emit a charged particle following neutron capture.  Elements Analyzed: boron, lithium, helium, nitrogen and several additional light elements with less sensitivity.  Sample Environment: In an evacuated chamber, samples are irradiated with a beam of low energy neutrons. A small percentage of the emitted reaction particles are analyzed by surface barrier detectors to determine their number and individual energies.  Principles: The emission intensity is compared to a known standard to quantitatively determine the elemental concentration. The emitted particles lose energy at a predicable rate as they pass through the film; the total energy loss correlates to the depth of the reacting nucleus.  Advantage: NDP is non-destructive. NDP analysis allows repeatedly determinations of the sample volume following different treatments.  Neutron beam flux at sample: 7.5x10 8 n/cm 2-s  Beam area: from a few mm 2 to 110 mm 2 These are theprimary reactions potentially available for NDP applications.  Scientific Opportunities / Applications:   Fusion Reactor Wall Annealing Study by NDP  The primary tungsten enclosure wall of a fusion reactor receives a large flux of energetic He ions during the fusion process. Accumulation of He leads to bubble formation that increase in number and size leading to the release of W metal particles into the chamber. An annealing protocol is needed to avert wall damage and maintain fusion efficiency. ORNL, ONR, UNC, &amp;amp; NIST are developing an annealing protocol to release implanted He preventing damage to the tungsten containment wall. Tungstencoupons are implanted at energies comparable to the expected &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; conditions in a fusion chamber. Some coupons were provided &amp;quot;as is,&amp;quot; others are subjected to various heat-time cycles. NDP is being used to assess the implantation energy, dose, and affect of annealing. The figure shows NDP determinations of 3He profiles used to calibrate the process "
