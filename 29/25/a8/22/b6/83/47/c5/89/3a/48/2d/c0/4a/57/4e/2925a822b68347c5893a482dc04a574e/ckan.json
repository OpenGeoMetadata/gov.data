    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Balcones Technologies, proposes to adapt actively controlled suspension technology developed for high performance off-road vehicles to address NASA's requirement for Active Vibration Control for Ground Support Equipment (GSE).  This innovative approach to meeting NASA needs exploits approximately $23M of highly successful R&amp;D since 1993 at the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics (CEM) on active suspension systems for off-road military vehicles.  STTR subtopic T6.02 indicates that previous experience on NASA's Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) shows that passive vibration isolation systems are inadequate and that actively controlled vibration isolation systems to supplement or replace existing passive systems will most likely be required.  Initial modeling of this system by CEM indicates that our team's proposed actively controlled Vibration Isolation System (VIS) provides more than an order of magnitude improvement in vibration isolation compared to conventional approaches (see proposal Part 4 for details).  Our actively controlled VIS offers unique benefits compared to conventional passive systems because it mimics compliant attachment to inertial reference systems rather than attachment to local reference systems on the vibrating MLP; eliminates resonant peaks associated with passive systems (i.e., our system has flat response at low frequencies); and provides 10 to 16 times better vibration isolation over most of the frequency range of interest than conventional systems.  Based on our vehicular active suspension results and preliminary modeling described in proposal Part 4, our proven design approach will yield robust solutions that are not sensitive to variations in GSE electronics racks or MLP excitations during shuttle launch.  This approach fully meets all requirements defined or implied in STTR 2007-1 Subtopic T6.02.",
