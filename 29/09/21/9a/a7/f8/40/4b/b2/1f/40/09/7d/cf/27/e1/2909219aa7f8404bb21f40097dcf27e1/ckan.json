    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS), which is part of the JPL Phaeton early career employee hands-on training program, aims to demonstrate optical communications technology. This is accomplished by transferring a video from hardware onboard the ISS to our ground receiver at JPL&amp;rsquo;s Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) in Wrightwood, California. To aid the ISS investigation in accurately pointing the downlink laser to the ground telescope, a laser beacon is transmitted from the OCTL to the ISS investigation, which is tracked by the investigation as the ISS travels across the sky. Each demonstration lasts for approximately two minutes during which the ISS and ground telescope maintain line of sight. The OPALS instrumentation gathers technical data during these demonstrations, which is then studied to determine hardware performance, with the goal of improving the design of next-generation optical communications systems.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scientific instruments in near-Earth and deep space missions increasingly require higher communication rates to transmit acquired data back to Earth, or to support high-data-rate applications (e.g., high-definition video streams). Optical communications (also referred to as lasercomm) is an emerging technology in which the data is modulated onto lasers to transmit the information. Because laser beams are significantly narrower than radio-frequency (RF) beams, optical communications offers the promise of delivering much higher power, and thereby achieving much higher data rates than the state of the art with RF beams. However, because laser beams are very narrow, the spacecraft must be able to very accurately point the laser beam to the receiving telescope on Earth as it travels across the sky, which is one of the primary challenges of lasercomm.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optical communications has the promise of meeting the high data rate expectations of future scientific instruments flying on NASAs missions, and improving the interconnectivity between near-Earth assets, such as the ISS, and Earth. OPALS is one of NASAs first demonstrations of an optical communications link from near Earth, and is designed to help chart the path for enabling optical communications in future missions. OPALS collects sensor data during the demonstrations to determine the performance of its laser link. The investigation team plans to use this data to advance the design and performance of future lasercomm links built to support NASAs space endeavors. Additionally, OPALS is used to educate a team of early career employees being trained as the next generation of JPL/NASA employees to develop space-based technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
