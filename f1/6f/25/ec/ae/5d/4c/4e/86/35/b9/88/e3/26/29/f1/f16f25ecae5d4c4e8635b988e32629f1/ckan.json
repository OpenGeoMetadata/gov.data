    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;There is a well-established need for more sensitive detectors in the 10 - 200 um wavelength range with high detectivity, D*&amp;gt;1010 cm-Hz1/2/W to increase the mapping speed for Earth and planetary science applications. LTS direct detectors with background limited performance are being widely deployed in arrays, in both space and ground-based situations (up to 104 pixels in the latter case). Megapixel array Si Blocked Impurity Band (BIB) and HgCdTe detectors are also widely used, but have a very sharp cutoff in sensitivity for &amp;gt;30 um. In addition, Si BIBs and LTS detectors require multi-stage refrigeration to 1000 at temperatures up to 75 K. The shift in resonance frequency under infrared irradiation, due to increasing temperature, enables each device to function as a thermometer for a separate bolometer pixel. Our current effort is directed towards achieving similar results with membrane-isolated devices by placing HTS resonators on SiNx membranes on Si substrates. Single transition edge sensor bolometers on SiNx membranes were demonstrated at JPL in 1995. We are employing an improved micromachining approach to membrane fabrication that is currently used to fabricate large arrays of resonator-based sensors based on low temperature superconductors. Our near-term goals are: (1) Development of a suitable fabrication process, including buffer layer and superconductor deposition, microresonator and readout circuit patterning, passivation, and membrane micromachining. (2) DC and microwave device characterization versus temperature and frequency. Follow-on work will concentrate on optical characterization of working detector arrays and extension to 2D arrays.&lt;/p&gt;",
