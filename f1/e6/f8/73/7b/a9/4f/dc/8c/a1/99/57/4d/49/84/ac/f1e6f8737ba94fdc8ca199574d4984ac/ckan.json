The laboratory is used to conduct biological breakdown studies and environmental impacts of traditional and novel energetics. Capabilities for Green manufacturing using molecular techniques for biosynthesis are under development. To support these activities the lab has invested in strategic instrumentation for analysis of inorganic and organic materials critical to process monitoring and sample screening. Instrumentation includes the following:  Ion Chromatography(IC) Detection of Ions and Cations High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC) Gas Chromatography(GC) Including Flame Ionization(FID) and Electron Capture Detection Biological Transfer Good Incubators "
