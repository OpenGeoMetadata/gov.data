    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As a result of significant technical effort, the Phase I was successful in delivering a solar simulator prototype that not only proved the initial concept but will significantly reduce future risk and increase our ability to deliver a fully-functional solar simulator in Phase II.   The proposed innovation is an LED-based, laboratory-scale, solar simulator.  The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the cell under test.  The simulator is adjustable in spectral matching for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability.  The solar simulator illuminates a square area 10 inches by 10 inches and includes optical sensors so that all metrics can be calibrated and validated automatically as needed.\r\n\r\nSolar simulation is critical for all solar cell testing, and current simulators will not work for coming 4, 5 and 6 junction technologies.  Because the vast majority of NASA missions rely on solar cells, this is critical, enabling test technology for future solar cells.  While accurate solar simulation is critical to all solar cell missions, it is particularly important to missions requiring large amounts of power, such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions.  Beyond NASA's needs, other members of the aerospace community, including solar cell manufacturers, test labs and research institutions, have a critical need for this capability which presents excellent commercialization opportunities after the Phase II maturation of the technology.",
