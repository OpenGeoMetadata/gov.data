  "notes": " This facility couples the knowledge of fabrics, non-wovens, high performance insulations, flexible photovoltaics, closures, and stealth and barrier materials with cutting-edge design and modeling capabilities. The team maintains a large stock of in-house fabrics, closures, and hardware to reduce lead times. It also maintains extensive contact with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia and the DoD shelter industrial base to obtain MILSPEC components. The facility boasts access to in-house fabric and Instron testing, a full-scale Rain Room and Environmental Chambers for evaluation of materials and components, and a knowledgeable field support team to train users or set up shelter systems in remote locations. There are three main foci:  Design and fabrication of tentage prototypes and supporting fabric accessories, such as command posts, advanced solar covers, and low profile/ reduced signature individual surveillance shelters. Small production run capabilities, including refur&amp;#173;bishment of field tentage and accessories such as passageways, insulated water pillow tanks, shower and laundry transition endwalls, and a variety of bootwalls. Global war on Terrorism programs to include CB protected shelter systems, liners, transition assem&amp;#173;blies, airlocks, and specialized fastening/sealing accessories. The facility is staffed by well-trained professionals with extensive experience, complemented by a large range of medium and heavy duty sewing machines, ultra sonic heat sealing and cutting, thermal hot air and hot wedge heat sealing, and tape sealing and mobile track sealers. Fabrication efforts are augmented with AutoCad capabilities to provide Level I documentation of designs and in-house task order contracting services to document designs at Level III.  ",
