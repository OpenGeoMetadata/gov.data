    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is a state of the art spacecraft mission design tool under active development at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).  GMAT is an open source project, periodically releasing code on publicly accessible repositories.  The tool has recently been operationally certified for use planning maneuvers for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of GMAT is built on an architecture that was originally designed to support multiple parallel runs of space flight problems on a distributed processing platform.  The implementation of GMAT, to date, has not exercised the features of the design that make parallel processing available to users.  The GMAT program in its current implementation runs on a single execution thread on modern computer systems, even when those systems contain multiple processing cores that allow for parallel execution of operations.  Thinking Systems is equipped to undertake the task of coding components that plug into GMAT's base code libraries in order to produce an efficient parallelization of GMAT's capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe parallelization of GMAT will be built by building replacement elements of several components of GMAT's core control engine and by implementing user scriptable elements that capitalize on these core components to provide processing on multiple threads simultaneously.  Thinking Systems will construct these components in a way that allows the parallel processing engine to run using GMAT's core library code.  The parallel engine will be built to work alongside existing GMAT code, and will be accessed using a separate user interface tailored to the parallel engine.   \r\n\r\nExamples of the types of problems that benefit from the proposed system are\r\nParametric studies using systematic changes in one or more parameters, Monte Carlo analysis problems, Large scale targeting problems, and Dispersion analysis studies",
