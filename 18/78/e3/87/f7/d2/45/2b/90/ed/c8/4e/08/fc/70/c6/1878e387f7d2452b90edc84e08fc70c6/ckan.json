    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Functional and parametric degradation of microcircuits due to total ionizing dose (TID) often pose serious obstacles to deployment of critical state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies in NASA missions. Shielding to the electronics box is used to mitigate TID degradation. Shielding materials can add significant amounts of mass to a system.&amp;nbsp; One method for reducing mass is to apply &amp;ldquo;spot&amp;rdquo; shielding located only on the critical components that require it. Board area is often a constraint for spot shield design.&amp;nbsp; 3-D printing technology offers promising breakthroughs in the design and deployment of radiation shielding optimized to the capability of the component, the mission radiation environment, and the shielding already provided by the component&amp;rsquo;s surroundings. Shields can be designed based upon the individualized package features to minimize area yet better protect from the omnidirectional radiation environment; such hand-and-glove fits would otherwise require complex machining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shield design is accomplished by the commercially-available NOVICE code.&amp;nbsp; NOVICE radiation attenuation calculations use the code&amp;rsquo;s ray-trace procedure in conjunction with 1-D attenuation data scaled for the different attenuation properties of the materials. A 3-D adjoint Monte-Carlo simulation verifies shielding effectiveness. NOVICE then generates the .STL CAD file for direct importation into a DMLS system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated successful development, fabrication, and mass-savings of a DMLS additive-manufactured component-level prototype shield. The prototype shield was assembled to a PCB-mounted operational amplifier as a proof-of-concept and for Phase II functional evaluation necessary to bring this technology to TRL-6.&amp;nbsp; Phase II efforts focus on environmental (vibration, thermal-vacuum) testing of the shield-component-PCB system.&amp;nbsp; Additional goals include demonstration of reliable DMLS-printed shield design and fit across package types, and assessment of the manufacturing quality of the DMLS-printed shields across multiple manufacturers and materials.&lt;/p&gt;",
