    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Micro-Space proposes to develop a low mass, automated form of the classic navigator's bubble sextant, with no moving parts, for rapid localization and reliable navigation on the Moon and Mars.  Day, night, near side and far side lunar operations will all be handled. \r\n\r\nExploration of the Moon (or Mars) without navigation aids comparable to those now common on Earth is a daunting, and generally unacceptable concept.  Since neither body has a significant magnetic field, even a compass is useless.  Creating and sustaining a GPS type satellite constellation will not occur soon.  But the self contained, automated system Micro-Space proposes is an excellent substitute. It can be installed on top of an astronaut's helmet, or atop a vehicle, in extended EVA. \r\n\r\nWith exploration extended into terrain where a vehicle is likely to become immobilized,  but access by a walking human is practical, vast areas of currently unknown territory can be examined at very close range.   But an hour's trek into convoluted terrain can leave the trekker seriously disoriented, and subject to human course decisions which could prove fatal. \r\n\r\nThe helmet mount system  will provide continuous EVA crew localization for emergency walk back to a safe haven, even if that path crosses unexplored territory.  Fixed asset or notable planetary feature localization will also be straightforward at any point in the EVA.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed optical navigation system uses production, solid state camera modules for Solar, Earth Shine, and Celestial sight readings, all with an accurate artificial horizon. But the accuracy required is produced by Micro-Space proprietary \"Sub Pixel\" processing techniques. Lunar localization accuracy will exceed < mile.  With the excellent directional reference also produced, this information will make visual identification of relevant terrain features easy. ",
