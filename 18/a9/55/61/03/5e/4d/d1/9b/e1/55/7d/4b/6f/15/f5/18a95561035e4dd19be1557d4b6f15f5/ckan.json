    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "\n       On August 17, 1996, the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA - National Space Development Agency) launched the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). ADEOS was in a descending, Sun synchronous orbit with a nominal equatorial crossing time of 10:30 a.m. Among the instruments carried aboard the ADEOS spacecraft was the Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS). OCTS is an optical radiometer with 12 bands covering the visible, near infrared and thermal infrared regions. (Eight of the bands are in the VIS/NIR. These are the only bands calibrated and processed by the OBPG) OCTS has a swath width of approximately 1400 km, and a nominal nadir resolution of 700 m. The instrument operated at three tilt states (20 degrees aft, nadir and 20 degrees fore), similar to SeaWiFS.      \n                                                                                \nIn 2001, The Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Program embarked on a collaborative effort with the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project to reprocess the entire Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) global area coverage (GAC) data set and make those products available to the scientific community. As part of the collaboration, NASDA provided the complete OCTS GAC Level-1A data set (November 1996 through June 1997) to NASA along with their unique expertise and analysis of the data products. (The OCTS GAC data set was created from the LAC resolution data by subsampling every 5th line and 4th pixel). NASA provided the processing expertise, methodologies and resources, and the archive and distribution support.                     \n                                                                                \nThe focus of the OCTS GAC reprocessing work was to minimize the potential processing-related differences (atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms) between the SeaWiFS and OCTS missions, by reprocessing the entire OCTS GAC mission archive using the same software and algorithms employed for standard SeaWiFS processing. \n        \n        This product contains the daily Level-3 binned (Equal-Area Sinusoidal grid) data products in three variants:\n            CHL- which includes chlorophyll a,\n            KD490 - which includes diffuse attenuation at 490nm and\n            RRS which includes the remote sensing reflectance in the visible bands, aerosol optical depth at 862nm and aerosol angstrom parameter.\n    ",
