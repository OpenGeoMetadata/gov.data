  "notes": "Determine if the belt transect method can be used to detect a 10% increase in native plant composition on upland and wet meadow habitats on Lacreek NWR within a 10 year period with 80% confidence. The 2006 Lacreek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) established management goals of restoring and enhancing the upland and wet meadow plant communities to create a mosaic that reflects the habitat requirements of grassland birds of management concern. Specifically, the CCP states that these two habitat types will be managed to provide the plant community composition and structure necessary to support selected birds of concern that occur in this ecoregion. Birds of concern with similar habitat requirements were grouped based on patch size, vegetation height requirements, and tolerance to trees. The CCP objectives for the upland and wet meadow habitats is to increase floristic quality assessment (FQA) “C” scores (Stohlgren et al. 1995) with in tall, medium, and short patches that are a given distance from trees. Following completion of the CCP, a monitoring program based on FQA was developed to assess progress in achieving the upland and wet meadow objectives. Initially, plots (20m x 50m) were established and measured twice in upland (n =5) and wet meadow (n = 5) communities to evaluate this methodology. This pilot effort identified several disadvantages of using this approach. Including the amount of time and personnel required to conduct this form of monitoring, and this method measures a “tolerance to disturbance.” Therefore, a plot may have a low “C” score but be composed of native species that are tolerant to disturbances such as burning and/or grazing. Based on the pilot results, a more rapid method was necessary to determine changes in native plant composition and structure and to provide information for management direction. The purpose of this project was to assess the potential of using the belt transect method to determine changes in native species composition and structure on upland and wet meadow habitats on Lacreek NWR.The belt transect method (Grant et al. 2004) was used to measure vegetation in selected refuge units two or more times. These included units that received disturbance and two units that received no disturbance. This data was analyzed to provide an overall summary of composition for the unit, and will be used to determine a standard deviation of the difference of the paired measurements. A default minimum sample size of n = 40 transects for each vegetation unit of interest would be a reasonable compromise if it is reasonable to expect the standard deviations of paired differences between 10 year time periods to be as high as 40%.",
