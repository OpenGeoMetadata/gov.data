    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current and upcoming NASA space links require both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&amp;C, ranging and voice services and highly efficient high-data rate links supporting Mission or Payload Data return. Both are important to the success of a mission and for many ongoing missions rely on aging ground element equipment. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both highly-reliable low-rate links and highly-efficient high-rate links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities. Current receiver designs typically address either high-rate or low-rate requirements but not both. NASA has requested a high-rate receiver capable of receiving coded and un-coded highly efficient modulation schemes supporting data throughput greater than 300Mbps. The proposed Phase I effort by Summation Research, Inc. (SRI) will develop, load, characterize and optimize these high-efficiency CCSDS and related modulations on a modern, high speed digital processing platform that can also support lower rate TTC and related links. Phase II work would then implement an analog IF front-end, develop deployable digital hardware to replace the evaluation boards used in Phase I, and combine the elements in an innovative Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver (PHMR).",
