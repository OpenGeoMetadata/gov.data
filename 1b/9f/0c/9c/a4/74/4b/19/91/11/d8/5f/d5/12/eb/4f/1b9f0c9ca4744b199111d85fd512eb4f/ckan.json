    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the results of fractional land cover analysis for nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) from two Landsat images of Manaus, Brazil, for October 14, 2004, and for July 29, 2005. Both images are from Landsat 5, path 231, row 62. The Manauas area experienced a squall line with intense downbursts from January 16-18, 2005, that resulted in widespread blowdown and tree mortality. The pre- and post-disturbance Landsat images were obtained and processed using spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in order to investigate forest disturbance and tree mortatility resulting from the downburst. SMA was based on scene-derived end-members of green vegetation (GV, photosynthetically active vegetation), NPV ( wood, dead vegetation, and surface litter), soil, and shade obtained using a pixel purity index (PPI) algorithm (Negron-Juarez et al., 2010). Changes in NPV due to disturbance were calculated by subtracting the 2004 NPV image from the 2005 NPV image. This NPV difference image is provided. There are three image files (.tif) with this data set: The two Landsat images that were georectified and converted to reflectance values and the NPV difference image. DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products.KNOWN PROBLEMS: Four additional images were needed to make this data set complete but are unavailable. Specifically, the two images resulting from SMA as applied to the Landsat images collected on the 14th of October, 2004 and the 29th of July, 2005 to determine per-pixel fractional abundance of GV, NPV (wood, dead vegetation, and surface litter), soil, and shade and the 2004 NPV and 2005 NPV images that were used to derive the NPV changes image (which we do provide) (Negron-Juarez, et al., 2010).",
