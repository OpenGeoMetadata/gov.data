  "notes": "Counts of migrating raptors were conducted along the Mississippi River Valley during the fall of 1992 for 211.3 hours (34 days) at Effigy Mounds National Monument. Allamakee County, Iowa, on the western slope of the river valley, and for 156.3 hours (29) days at Eagle Valley Nature Preserve, Grant County, Wisconsin, on the eastern slope of the river valley. Overall totals and same-day comparative counts were consistently higher on the Wisconsin side of the valley. At Effigy Mounds, 1640 migrating raptors were observed (7.7 per hour); at Eagle Valley 4116 migrating raptors were observed (26.33 per hour). The highest count recorded at Effigy was on September 19 when 288 raptors were observed, while the highest count at Eagle Valley was 1584 which occurred on September 18. Broad-winged Hawks were the most abundant raptor observed at both sites. Comparison of peak migration period counts in 1992 counts with previous counts conducted from 1982-1991 show Broad-winged and Red-tailed Hawks were the most abundant and our data suggest fairly stable numbers during the past ten years. Bald Eagles and Peregrine Falcons were much less abundant but the average per hour during the period of bulk movements appears fairly consistent. We found slight increases in the rates of Sharpshinned Hawks, Northern Harriers, Ospreys and American Kestrels observed, and we found decreases in Goshawk, Cooper's, Rough-legged, and Red -shouldered Hawks.",
