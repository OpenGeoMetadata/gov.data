  "notes": "A report documenting physical and chemical parameters limiting game fish production in regulating reservoirs as well as angler use and harvest in reservoir regulation. In 1985, the four major regulatory reservoirs in Lahontan Valley provide 7,825 angler days to 1,010 anglers with an estimated harvest of 30,712 fish. Harmon Reservoir, Rattlesnake Reservoir, Sheckler Reservoir and Old River Reservoir collectively accounted for 29.71 percent of angler days and 36.95 percent of angler harvest in  Lahontan Valley in 1985. Creel census was conducted in Lahontan Valley on nine days during 1986. In total, 324 anglers reported expending 685.8 hours to capture 613 fish for a catch rate of .894 fish/hour. On the regulating reservoirs, catch rates by reservoir are 2.29 fish per hour at Rattlesnake Reservoir, 2.00 fish per hour at Sheckler Reservoir and .789 fish per hour at Harmon Reservoir. For the regulating reservoirs species checked in the creel in order of abundance includes black bullhead, white bass, channel catfish, black bass, white catfish and Sacramento perch. During hydrolab profiles taken on the regulating reservoirs in May and August, the only factors limiting to fish populations were dissolved oxygen which fell below 5.0 ppm at Sheckler Reservoir. Beach seining transects were conducted in August to document recruitment of game fish. Production of young-of-the-year appeared to be highly variable among the four regulating reservoirs. Species diversity in recruitment also varied widely. Fish samples were collected for mercury analysis in 1986 from four waters on the Stillwater Wildlife Refuge and from two regulating reservoirs. Mercury concentrations in game fish ranged from .19 ug/g in  a 6.7 inch white crappie to 3.39 ug/g in a 9.5 inch white bass. In game fish sampled at Big Indian Lake, 40 percent exceeded mercury levels over 1 ug/g. At Rattlesnake Reservoir in 11 game fish sampled, only one fish exceeded 1 ug/g of mercury. Waters sampled in which game fish did not exceed mercury levels of 1 ug/g include Twin Lake, Dutch Bill Lake, Lead Lake and Harmon Reservoir. The only game fish stocked in regulating reservoirs in 1986 consist of a single plant of 6,500 three inch channel catfish which were released at Sheckler Reservoir on September 4, 1986. Water level fluctuations of regulating reservoirs monitored by Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), varied from the complete draining of Old River Reservoir by vandals in February to a fluctuation of 1.09 feet in Rattlesnake Reservoir. During the calendar year of 1986, the maximum vertical change in water level at Sheckler Reservoir was 4.84 feet. At Harmon Reservoir water levels fluctuated 3.01 feet during this year.",
