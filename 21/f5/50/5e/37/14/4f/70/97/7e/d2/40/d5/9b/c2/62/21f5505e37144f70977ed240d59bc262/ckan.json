  "notes": "The purpose of this effort was to characterize the extent and magnitude of chemical contamination in the St. Thomas East End Reserves or STEER, as part of a larger project to develop an integrated ecosystem assessment for the STEER. The STEER is a collection of marine reserves and wildlife sanctuaries on the southeastern end of the island of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Within the STEER, however, are a variety of land use and maritime activities that are thought to impact the Reserves. As part of a project requested by STEER managers and funded by CRCP, NCCOS/CCMA scientists conducted a field mission in June 2011 to the STEER, and collected sediments that were characterized for chemical contaminants. A broad suite of chemical contaminants were analyzed in sediment, coral (Porites asteroides) and conch (Strombus gigas)samples including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated pesticides including DDT and its metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), major and trace elements, and butyltins. This project provides valuable baseline data on sediment chemical contamination that is georeferenced and posted on the internet through the NOAA's National Status and Trends data portal.",
