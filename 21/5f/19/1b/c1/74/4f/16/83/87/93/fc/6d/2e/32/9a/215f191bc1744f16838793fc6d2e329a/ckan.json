  "notes": "Vegetation mapping has been conducted at various City of San Diego Park and Recreation Open Space lands in support of natural resource management objectives and the City's MSCP. In 2004, vegetation mapping and sensitive species surveys were conducted at the Tecolote Canyon Natural Park by HELIX Environmental Planning, Inc. (HELIX) to establish baseline data for the park's Natural Resource Management Plan. RECON Environmental conducted vegetation mapping at Mission Trails Regional Park (MTRP) in 2008 in support of the MSCP. This dataset was compiled as part of the Southern California Data Integration Project. Vegetation mapping (including mapping of exotic species) of Tecolote Canyon was conducted in the spring of 2004 on georeferenced aerial photos (flown January 2003; scale 1\"=200'; Andrea Bitterling, pers. comm.). Vernal pools and rare plants were mapped with a GPS, with accuracy of approximately 1 meter. RECON biologists mapped the vegetation in MTRP between March 18 and April 24, 2008. A three-fold approach to vegetation mapping at MTRP was taken: reviewing historical biological information, mapping potential vegetation communities using aerial photographs, and conducting field mapping. Prior to conducting the field work, existing GIS data from the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB), vegetation data from SanGIS, and vernal pool data from the City of San Diego were all examined. In addition, aerial photographs from 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2007 were reviewed to assist with vegetation identification. Digital orthorectified aerial images with 1-foot resolution, taken in 2007, were carefully re Field mapping consisted of driving or hiking to all areas in the MTRP. Areas identified as a homogeneous vegetation community stand in the field were mapped as individual polygons (CNPS 2004). Homogenous stands ranged in size from 0.25 acre to hundreds of acres. Most of the homogeneous stands were large, making it difficult to summarize the species compositio",
