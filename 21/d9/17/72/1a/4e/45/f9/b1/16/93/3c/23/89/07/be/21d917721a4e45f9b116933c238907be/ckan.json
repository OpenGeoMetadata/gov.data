  "notes": " he Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) program makes available, on a competitive basis, certain critical resources needed for the development of new therapeutic agents for both common and rare diseases. Investigators do not receive grant funds through this program. Instead, successful applicants receive access to NIH experts and contractors who conduct pre-clinical studies at no cost to the investigator. In general, synthesis, formulation, pharmacokinetic and toxicology services in support of investigator-held IND applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available. NIH contractors conduct pre-clinical studies on behalf of successful applicants. NCATS, along with any collaborating NIH Institutes and Centers, supports contract costs. Access to contracts is based on a peer-reviewed application process. The number of awards in any given cycle will depend on the number of applications received, their scientific merit and the availability of NIH funds. Find out how to apply to BrIDGs. As of fall 2014, BrIDGs has generated data to support 15 INDs that have been cleared by the FDA and one clinical trial application cleared by Health Canada. A total of 14 projects have been evaluated in clinical trials. Five BrIDGs-supported agents have gone as far as phase II human clinical trials, in which researchers give an experimental therapy to a group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a treatment. Third-party investors have licensed seven agents during or after their development by BrIDGs.  ",
