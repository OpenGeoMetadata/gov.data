  "notes": "This data set contains human-use resource data for aquaculture facilities, boat ramps, set nets (for commercial fishing), oil facilities, pipelines, platforms, State and regional parks, and roads in Cook Inlet and Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Vector points and lines in this data set represent the location of human-use sites. Location-specific type and source information is stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer. See also the MGT (Management Area Polygons) data layer, part of the larger Cook Inlet and Kenai Peninsula ESI database, for additional human-use information.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Cook Inlet and Kenai Peninsula. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
