    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "High temperature power electronics have become a vital aspect of future designs for power converters in spacecraft, battle zone electric power, satellite power conditioning, and well drilling. The performance of these applications would benefit significantly from materials designed for high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions. NASA's Venus mission has some of the most stringent requirements with an operating temperature of 486C. Power systems must operate efficiently at these temperatures to eliminate the need for onboard cooling systems. The removal of these cooling systems will save space, reduce weight, and improve reliability. Currently, BaTiO3-based X7R capacitors are re-rated for use above 125C, and are rendered inoperable at temperatures approaching 300C. NPO-type dielectrics tend to operate at somewhat higher temperatures, but have low dielectric constants and become unreliable above 400C. TRS Technologies is pleased to respond to NASA's need for high temperature capacitors with this Phase I SBIR proposal. In this SBIR program, TRS Technologies and its subsidiary, Centre Capacitor, will develop a new family of high temperature capacitors based on high Curie temperature ferroelectrics that operate at temperatures far beyond conventional dielectric formulations. These new higher temperature (~490C) materials will be suited for the advanced power electronics required for Venus exploration.",
