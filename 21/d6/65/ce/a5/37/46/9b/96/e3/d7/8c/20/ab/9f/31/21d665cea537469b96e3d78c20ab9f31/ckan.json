    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

These will be launched in the Fall period to study the characteristics of the MSPs without the complications introduced by the presence of NLCs and other phenomena containing ice droplets.&amp;nbsp; The campaign has been selected for And&amp;oslash;ya Rocket Range&amp;nbsp; (ARR) in Norway because of the nearby ALOMAR Observatory, which is composed of several critical lidars and radars for support of this mission.&amp;nbsp; The program is a follow-on to an earlier program conducted from ARR in 2007.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the prime instrument is the MASS or aerosol mass analyzer, which has been improved to increase the mass range of particles observed in the earlier mission. It is accompanied by Faraday rotation radio propagation experiment to measure electron density, a positive ion probe pair, a payload potential measurement, UV and photoelectric measurements and dust detectors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
