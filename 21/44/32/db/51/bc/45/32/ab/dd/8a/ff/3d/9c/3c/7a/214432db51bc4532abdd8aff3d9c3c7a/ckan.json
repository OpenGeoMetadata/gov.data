  "notes": "The April 1 snowpack was 147% of average and projected stream flow into Lahontan Reservoir was 150% of average between April 1 and August 1. Late storms increased this amount by 25%, bringing projections to 186% of average. Actual flows were around 200%. The year began with 8,500 surface acres of wetland habitat and ended with all 22,000 acres of \"developed\" wetlands full and water present in Big Water, alkali flats and Big Water for a total of around 40,000 surface acres. All units were flushed using the 124,733 AF of water that reached the marsh. Salinities in the Nutgrass Unit were reduced from 22,000 mm/cm to 3,500. Diagonal Drain salinities averaged 500 mmhoss the lowest on record. The preliminary estimate of water over Lahontan was 522,884 AF (362,000 April to July) of which 282,799 reached the SWMA (over 137,000 AF went to the Sink), Quite a lot of water was spread in Olie's drainage, East, West and Raiute Pasture and along the new D-Line. Production of submergent aquatic vegetation was generally good to excellent. However, some units were too deep for optimum production. Rainfall and water spreading greatly improved upland forage for cattle and wildlife. This is the 1983 plan.",
