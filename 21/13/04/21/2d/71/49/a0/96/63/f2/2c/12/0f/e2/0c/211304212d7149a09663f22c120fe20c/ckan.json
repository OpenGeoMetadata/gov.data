    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Subsurface caverns may be the best place on Mars to find life. They may be the best hope for safe havens and habitation on the Moon. They can provide a window into a planet&amp;rsquo;s geology, climate, and even biology. Skylights, formed by partial cave ceiling collapse, provide access to subsurface voids. Tunnel entrances have been conclusively shown to exist on Mars and the Moon. There is also evidence supporting their existence on other planetary bodies throughout the solar system. Despite astonishing discoveries of skylights and cave entrances, and their inevitable exploration, they do not yet appear in the decadal survey. Skylights and the voids below are so unknown that it is too risky to send astronauts to explore them without prior robotic reconnaissance and modeling. While robotic exploration of skylights and caves can seek out life, investigate geology and origins, and open the subsurface of other worlds to humankind, it is a daunting venture. Planetary voids present challenging terrain that requires innovative technologies for access, exploration, and modeling. The robots that venture into caves must leap, fly, or rappel into voids, traverse rubble, navigate safely in the dark, self-power, and explore autonomously with little or no communication to Earth. Exploiting these features necessitates a &amp;ldquo;leap&amp;rdquo; of technology from current planetary missions, which land with large error ellipses in statistically safe terrain, rove slowly and cautiously across the surface, depend on the sun for power and light, and rely heavily on human commands. Phase II develops the enabling technologies in the context of &amp;ldquo;Spelunker&amp;rdquo;, a prototype mission concept to explore a lunar skylight and cave. The Spelunker mission specifies safe landing on the rim of a skylight, tethered descent of a power and communications hub, and autonomous cave exploration by multiple hybrid driving/hopping robots. In this context, the Phase II study will expose and address major feasibility issues inherent in mission architecture for skylight access; robot configuration for in-cave mobility and subsurface sensing; terrain modeling in darkness from a lightweight, dynamic platform; and autonomy for exploring with hopping robots.&lt;/p&gt;",
