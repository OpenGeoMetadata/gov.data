    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In order to achieve a high payoff turbopump with a low investment, the modern turbopump in today's space propulsion program is required to have greater life, with lower maintenance costs.  In order to achieve lower maintenance costs, the turnaround time between mission cycles must be kept to a minimum.  At each cycle, one item on the maintenance checklist to be conducted is rotor torque.\r\nIn order for a turbopump to be returned to service, among other requirements, it must be clear of all FOD as well as damage to the rotor or bearings.  One maintenance check that is a valid indicator of FOD or rotor and bearing damage is a rotor torque check.  Failure of a turbopump due to rotor or bearing damage may lead to an event categorized as a Criticality 1 (Loss of Life or Vehicle) failure mode.\r\nIn most modern turbopumps, performing a rotor torque check involves timely and costly maintenance procedures.  In many cases, inlet piping or structural cases must be removed to expose the turbopump rotor.  As each piece of hardware is reinstalled, they routinely must undergo lengthy quality checks to ensure proper assembly and function.\r\nFTT proposes development of a means to measure the rotor torque through the use of an electromagnetic drive device.  Similar to a DC electrical motor, the new component would be powered and cause the rotor to rotate.  After recording measurements of the rotor speed and electromagnet input power, the rotor torque could be calculated.  Incorporating a device such as this into a turbopump would reduce time associated with torque measurements from days to seconds.\r\n",
