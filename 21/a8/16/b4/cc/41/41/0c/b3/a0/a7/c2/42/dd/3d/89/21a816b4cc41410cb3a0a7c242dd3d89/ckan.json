    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains two ASCII files (.csv format). One file contains site characteristics, stand descriptors, and above-ground biomass and ANPP data for seven old-growth temperate forest stands and one young cove forest stand in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. The old-growth stands (> 200 years old) span several watersheds on the north slope of the mountains at elevations ranging from 720 to 1,140 m. The younger stand (48-63 years old, elevation 910 m) developed after agricultural abandonment.The second file contains monthly mean climate data averaged over four years (1947-1950) from four climate stations located along an elevational gradient (445-1,920 m) in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.DBH measurements were made at the beginning the study and biomass increment was measured from a subset of trees. ANPP was estimated using regional species-specific allometric relationships for tree mass. Biomass, volume, and annual input of coarse woody detritus are also reported.Live biomass in the old-growth stands (32,600-47,100 g/m2) is among the highest reported for temperate forests of eastern North America while ANPP is moderate (630-1,010 g/m2/yr). ANPP in the younger stand was higher (1,180-1,310 g/m2/yr). In comparison with forests worldwide, inputs of coarse woody debris is moderate.",
