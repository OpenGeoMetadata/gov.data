    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The \"HIRDLS/Aura Level 3 Chlorofluorocarbon-12 (CFC-12) Zonal Fourier Coefficients\" version 7 data product (H3ZFCCFC12) contains the entire mission (~3 years) of HIRDLS data expressed as zonal Fourier coefficients in 1 degree latitude bands and 121 pressure levels. The coefficients are computed from the HIRDLS Level 2 profiles with a Kalman filter approach using both forward and backward passes in time. Expressed as the mean and up to 7 sine and cosine coefficients (4 waves for ascending and descending, 7 waves for combined), these coefficients may be used to compute values at any longitude. The data are provided on a pressure grid with 24 levels per decade, corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The vertical range of the CFC-12 data is 316 to 8.3 hPa. The precision values are given by the root-mean square of the differences between the estimated fields and the input data.\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a zonal object with data for the entire mission with separate data\nfields for ascending (daytime), descending (nighttime), and combined orbit node. The data arrays have 145 latitude steps (-64 to 80 degrees), 121 pressure steps, 15 Fourier coefficients (mean plus first 7 cosine and 7 sign waves),\nand 1151 daily time steps from January 22, 2005 through March 17, 2008. The coefficients are computed at a daily synoptic time of 12:00 UTC.  That time is expressed in TAI-93 seconds (seconds since January 1, 1993) and the date is also stored in separate year, month and day fields. The ascending and descending datasets include LocalSolarTime and SolarZenithAngle values.\n\nParameters contained in the data files include the following:\nVariable Name|Description|Units\nCFC12|CFC-12 (CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) Volume Mixing Ratio|mol/mol\nEnd of parameter information",
