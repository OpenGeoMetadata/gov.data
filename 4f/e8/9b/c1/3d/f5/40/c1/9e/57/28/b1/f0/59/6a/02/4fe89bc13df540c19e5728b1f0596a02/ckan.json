  "notes": "Many studies have evaluated selenium in the lower Colorado River, but none have reviewed selenium levels after river water has been directed into previously isolated backwaters. Radtke et al. (1988) hypothesized that the source of selenium was the upper Colorado River Basin and that backwater lakes along the river were sinks for selenium contamination. Subsequent research has reported that backwater lakes could become selenium sinks when lower Colorado River water is introduced into isolated backwater lakes originally fed by groundwater and where low exchange rates increase retention time. Backwaters created as isolated native fish habitats in partial fulfillment of the Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives of the Service’s Biological Opinion on the Bureau of Reclamation’s operation of the lower Colorado River allow the fish to grow in a predator-free environment, but also may be contributing to selenium bioaccumulation along the lower Colorado River. Our goals in this study were to conduct a pre- and post-backwater manipulation investigation of created backwaters. To assess selenium accumulation in backwaters, we sampled water, sediment, and macroinvertebrates in 2001 and 2004. We also collected fish tissues in 2001-2004 for a baseline analysis on native fish stock in constructed, isolated backwaters. We compared Beal Lake (Havasu National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Arizona (AZ)) and the DU Ponds (Imperial NWR, AZ), newly constructed/engineered experimental backwaters, with Office Cove (Bill Williams River NWR, AZ) and High Levee Pond (Cibola NWR, AZ), which were previously constructed and established backwaters. Management of the experimental backwaters changed during the study, in an attempt to meet the objectives of the isolated native fish habitat project. One of the most significant changes occurred at the DU Ponds when pumped groundwater replaced the mainstem river water supply as a measure to reduce non-native fish infiltration. The use of only groundwater at the DU Ponds may have affected selenium accumulation. The other changes led to our inability to detect patterns between years, especially in fish tissues. We detected some significant differences between selenium concentrations over time. Selenium concentrations in water increased significantly during the four year study at Office Cove (Table 1). Most sediment samples had greater selenium concentrations in 2004 although the only significant difference was at Beal Lake. Crayfish selenium concentrations were higher at Beal Lake and the DU Ponds than in Office Cove and High Levee Pond in 2001, but very little selenium was detected in 2004 invertebrate composite samples. Selenium concentrations in crayfish were slightly lower than those previously reported in other backwater studies. Concern for the potential for selenium bioaccumulation in lower Colorado River backwaters still exists. Other metals of potential concern that we found include zinc and copper. We did document continued selenium bioaccumulation in crayfish and fishes, but water concentrations of selenium seem diminished in comparison to previous field studies. Creation of lower Colorado River backwaters should be monitored for selenium concentrations pre- and post-manipulation, especially post-manipulation. We propose using High Levee Pond as a reference site in all future backwater studies along the lower Colorado River because it consistently had low concentrations of selenium in water, sediment, and crayfish and it had water quality measurements suggesting it was a connected backwater. Connected backwaters are most similar to the mainstem of the river because of their higher flushing rates and lower water residence times. We believe that continued monitoring is warranted at Beal Lake since it consistently had high concentrations of selenium in water, sediment, and crayfish. We also suggest selenium monitoring at Willow Beach since it is a significant hatchery for native fishes in the southwest.",
