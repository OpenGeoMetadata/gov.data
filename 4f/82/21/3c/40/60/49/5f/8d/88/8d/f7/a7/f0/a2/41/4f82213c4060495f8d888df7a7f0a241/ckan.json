    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Highly reflective optical coatings with low scatter properties are needed to image very faint objects such as extra-solar planets.  Silver has the highest reflectivity of all metals but tarnishes readily upon exposure to atmospheric pollutants.  In this research, Surface Optics Corporation (SOC) will develop a non-tarnishing silver mirror coating based an ion assisted, thermal evaporation process.  The recipe for this durable silver mirror system was patented by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and is based on an alternative deposition method, namely, reactive sputtering.   Developing a methodology to manufacture protected silver by ion assisted evaporation will allow these proven designs to be fabricated with SOC?s large aperture coating facility.  SOC recently developed and implemented a unique vacuum coating system that utilizes a computer controlled, translating evaporation source.  This system is capable of producing highly uniform optical films with low scatter properties, on curved substrates up to 3-meters in diameter.  The combination of SOC's novel coating methods and LLNL's novel coating designs, will establish a unique and very valuable coating resource for the astronomical community.",
