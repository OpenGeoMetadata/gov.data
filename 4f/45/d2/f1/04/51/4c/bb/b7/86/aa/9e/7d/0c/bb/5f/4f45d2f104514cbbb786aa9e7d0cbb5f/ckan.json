This helicopter-supported sampling project was part of a statewide assessment of Alaska's potential for rare-earth element (REE) mineralization, and was funded by the Rare Earth Elements and Strategic Minerals Assessment capital improvement project. During this field project, 32 stream sediment and 28 heavy-mineral pan concentrate samples were collected for geochemical analysis (geochemical trace elements and rare earth elements). An additional historic U.S. Bureau of Mines sample from the area was also analyzed as part of this report. Highlights of the DGGS sampling project include documenting new gold-bearing drainages and identifying several samples with high REE values.",
