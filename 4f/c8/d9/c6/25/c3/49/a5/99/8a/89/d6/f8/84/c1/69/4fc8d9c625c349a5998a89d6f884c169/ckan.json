The MTDB represents\n               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data\n               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Primary roads are generally divided, limited-access highways within the interstate highway\n               system or under State management, and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll\n               highways. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1100 for primary roads. Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway,\n               State Highway, and/or County Highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have\n               at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways. They usually have both a local name and a route number. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification\n               Code (MTFCC) is S1200 for secondary roads.",
