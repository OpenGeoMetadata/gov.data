  "notes": "FUNCTION: Provides the capability to perform analysis, testing, and prototype development of highspeed wired and wireless networked data communication systems. It provides connectivity to both classified (SIPRNet) and unclassified (NIPRNet) networks through high-speed Ethernet and fiber optic interfaces with connections to the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) to facilitate collaborative efforts with other DoD facilities. DESCRIPTION: The Integrated Communications Technology (ICT) Test Lab provides a rapidly reconfigurable means to perform testing and evaluation of advanced networking technologies. In the past, this has supported multiple DoD programs such as Fleet Battle Experiments, Joint Forces Command Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation, Joint Experimentation, Joint Task Force (JTF) WARNET, and Dragon Warrior. It is an integral part of the Global Information Grid End-to-End Evaluation Facilities (GIG-EF). This facility provides the simulation and test environment required to support the research and development of advanced dynamic networking protocols, wireless communication, and network management for the Navy&amp;rsquo;s future networking needs. This facility offers a unique capability to evaluate vendor capabilities that have potential benefits for Navy systems. INSTRUMENTATION: Test equipment such as network traffic generators and analyzers, signal generators, and spectrum analyzers allow real-time injection and monitoring of wired and wireless (e.g., WiMax, 802.11x) traffic flows from simulated and &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; data sources. Routers, switches, and interface adapters provide reconfigurable connectivity throughout the facility. Test Lab computers running NRLdeveloped software test programs tailored to meet specific test requirements can assess the performance of military and commercial off the- shelf (COTS) equipment such as network radios, routers, and communications security (COMSEC) devices. Network performance parameters such as throughput, latency, jitter, and packet error rates are easily measured and documented.  ",
