  "notes": "The Landsat TM Orthorectified Mosaics data collection is derived from a global set of high-quality, relatively cloud-free orthorectified TM imagery from Landsats 4-5. This dataset was selected and generated through NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing Program, as part of a cooperative effort between NASA and the commercial remote sensing community to provide users with access to quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over the Earth's land masses. The data collection was compiled via NASA contract with Earth Satellite Corporation (Rockville, MD) in association with NASA's Scientific Data Purchase program. The Landsat Orthorectified TM Mosaics data collection is derived from approximately 7,461 TM (Landsat 4-5) images, which were selected to provide a full set of global coverage (circa 1990). All selected images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover. In addition, only images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possible presence of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected.",
