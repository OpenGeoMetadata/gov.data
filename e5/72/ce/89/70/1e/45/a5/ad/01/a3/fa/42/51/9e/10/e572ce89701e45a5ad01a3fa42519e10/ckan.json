  "notes": "Various resource projects have been conducted in the City of San Diego's Open Space Parks as part of the implementation of the City's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP). In 2004, vegetation mapping and sensitive species surveys were conducted by HELIX Environmental Planning, Inc. (HELIX) at the Tecolote Canyon Natural Park to establish baseline data for the park's Natural Resource Management Plan. These efforts were supported by a Local Assistance Grant from the CDFG. Efforts included vegetation mapping (presented in a separate data layer), mapping of exotic species, rare plant surveys and bird count surveys at Tecolote Canyon in spring 2004 (Andrea Bitterling, HELIX pers comm.). Rare plant surveys were conducted in May and included observations of sensitive animal species. Nine bird count stations were established throughout the Park based on ease of access (from nearby streets) and vegetation communities present (an effort was made to sample as many different communities as possible). Stations were at the closest approximately 1,400 feet apart but an unlimited radius for counting encircled each station. Weather conditions and the ambient noise (subjectively rated on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 being low) at each station were recorded. The bird count surveys were conducted between approximately 0615 and 1300 hours on May 7 and June 8, 2004. Ten minutes were spent at each station, and birds that were directly observed were counted while those that were heard only were also recorded. Any other species (e.g., coyote [Canis latrans]) that was observed was also recorded along with sensitive non-avian species (e.g., orange-throated whiptail [Aspidoscelis hyperythra beldingi]), management concern species (e.g., brown-headed cowbird [Molothrus ater]) and habitat disturbances. All species that were observed while walking between count stations (and not already observed at the previous station) were noted as well. HELIX also compiled biological resource data collected by Dudek & Associates and Tierra Environmental Services for emergency sewer repair projects conducted in the park (HELIX 2006). These data are also included. This datalayer presents the geospatial data collected from these surveys and was compiled for the Southern California Data Integration Project.
