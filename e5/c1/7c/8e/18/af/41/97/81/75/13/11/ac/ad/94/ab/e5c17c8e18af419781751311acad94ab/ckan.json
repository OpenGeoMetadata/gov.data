    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this NASA Phase I SBIR program is to leverage lightweight, durable materials developed by NanoSonic for use within extra vehicular activity (EVA) space boots to provide the following benefits: weight reduction, increased durability/longevity and thermal protection/comfort.  NanoSonic will collaborate with ILC Dover, the manufacturer of the EVA space boot, to develop next-generation designs employing the adaptive thermal control materials described herein.  Next-generation designs will increase the comfort and productivity while reducing fatigue and injury risks provided to crew members.  Further, these next-generation EVA boot materials shall also provide enhanced instep support and enable better boot sizing as indexing.\r\n\r\nTo address the comfort and thermal concerns within the EVA boot, NanoSonic will work with ILC Dover, the world's leader in EVA spacesuits, who was recently awarded the contract by NASA to develop the Z-2 advanced spacesuit.  In addition to providing enhancements for foot indexing and thermal comfort, NanoSonic will work with ILC to ensure that the solutions developed herein provide weight savings and increased durability such that the EVA prototype boots developed in the Phase II effort will afford crew members increased comfort and productivity while reducing fatigue and injury risk.  The proposed program would start at TRL 5 and end at TRL 8 after a Phase II effort.",
