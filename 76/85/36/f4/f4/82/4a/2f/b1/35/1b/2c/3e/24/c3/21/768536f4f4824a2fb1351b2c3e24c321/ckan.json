  "notes": "This part of DS 781 presents data for the folds for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Scott Creek map area, California. The vector data file is included in \"Folds_OffshoreScottCreek.zip,\" which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7CJ8BJW. The offshore of Scott Creek map area straddles the right-lateral San Gregorio Fault Zone, an important structure in the distributed transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates (see, for example, Dickinson and others, 2005). Regionally, this fault is part of a system that occurs predominantly in the offshore for about 400 km from Point Conception in the south (where it is known as the Hosgri fault; Johnson and Watt, 2012) to Bolinas and Point Reyes in the north (Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). The San Gregorio Fault in the map area is part of a 90-km-long offshore segment that extends from Point Sur on the south, across outer Monterey Bay to Point AÂçòo Nuevo (just one kilometer north of the map area) on the north (Weber and Lajoie, 1980; Brabb, 1997; Wagner and others, 2002). Offshore parts of this fault system are identified on seismic-reflection data based on abrupt truncation or warping of reflections and (or) juxtaposition of reflection panels with different seismic parameters. In this map area, the San Gregorio Fault forms a distributed about 2-km-wide shear zone that includes two main faults. The nearshore eastern part of the zone, which includes the Coastways Fault, partly coincides with a prominent bathymetric lineament on the outer flank of nearshore bedrock outcrops between Waddell Creek and Davenport. The western part of the zone, which includes the Frijoles Fault, cuts across the flat, sediment-covered shelf. Cumulative lateral slip on San Gregorio Fault Zone in this region is thought to range from 4 to 10 mm/yr (Weber, 1994). McCulloch (1987) considered the San Gregorio Fault Zone the eastern margin of the Outer Santa Cruz Basin (fig. 8-1). Farther offshore, outside California's State Waters but within the map area, this basin is cut by the northwest-trending Ascension Fault (Greene and others, 2002; U.S. Geological Survey and California Geological Survey, 2010).
