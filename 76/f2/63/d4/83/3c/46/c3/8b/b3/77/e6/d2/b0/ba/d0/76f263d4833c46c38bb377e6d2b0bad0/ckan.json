    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The National Research Council (NRC) has identified the need for motors and actuators that can operate in extreme high and low temperature environments as a technical gap to exploring deeper into our solar systems.  The need for high temperature motors and actuators for robotic mechanisms is critical to explore the surface and atmosphere of Venus, Jupiter and/or Saturn.  \r\n\r\nBear Technologies, LLC (Bear) proposes to create environmentally tolerant motors for robotic missions.  As identified by NRC and NASA there are no commercial actuators or motors that can work in wide variation and high temperature environments (-50 degrees Centigrade to 500 degrees Centigrade).  The current approach has been to shield or isolate the environment from these systems. The problem with this approach is that it limits the ability to explore on surface, increases the bulk and is expensive with temperature control systems.  The need is to create tolerant technologies that can operate in the extreme environment. \r\n\r\nBear Technologies has been exploring motor design for more than 5 years.  Currently, Bear is working on a high torque direct drive electric motor under a Phase II award.   The concept proposed uses new design concepts coupled with tolerant material to create a temperature tolerant motor (TTM). The proposed motor concept has a fundamentally different design that offers offers higher torque and lower speed than traditional motor design.  This novel design will help minimize failure risks at extreme temperatures.  By combining certain extreme temperature materials with no ball bearing or lubrication, the Principle Investigator (PI) believes the motor concept has the potential to function for an increased period of time in extreme environments. Motor and actuator technologies that are capable of operating in the high-temperature (460 degrees C) and high-pressure (90 bars) Venus surface environment are needed for multiple robotic systems.",
