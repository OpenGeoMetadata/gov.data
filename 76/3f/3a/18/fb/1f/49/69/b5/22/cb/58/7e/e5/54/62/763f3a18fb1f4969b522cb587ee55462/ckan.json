  "notes": "Raster-based land cover data sets are derived from 30-meter resolution Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. These data sets were created at the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The Land Management Information Center converted these data files into EPPL7 format to be used with EPPL7 mapping products. There are currently three themes in this data set: 1. Landsat Level-1 Land Cover Classification of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, 2000: This coverage consists of 6 classes including: urban/developed, agriculture (planted or cultivated), forest, non-forested vegetation, water, not classified. 2. Landsat Level-2 Land Cover Classification of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, 2000: This coverage consists of 12 classes including: 0-4% impervious, 5-10% impervious, 11-25% impervious, 26-50% impervious 51-75% impervious, 76-100% impervious, Cropland, Planted trees & grasses, Coniferous, Deciduous, Upland shrubland & herbaceous, Lowland shrubland & herbaceous, Water. Definitions for these classes are based on the Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS). 3. Impervious Surface Classification of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, 2000: Landsat TM data have been used to map the percentage of impervious surface area of the seven-county TCMA for the year 2000. Impervious surfaces are defined as areas impenetrable by water - including roads, rooftops, sidewalks and parking lots. The coverage provides information on the percentage of impervious surface on a 30-meter pixel basis for all urban areas. The impervious surface layer was derived from a single date of Landsat-5 TM data. Following the classification of land cover types, a regression model relating percent impervious surface area to Landsat TM greenness values was used to estimate the percent impervious surface area for pixels classified as urban or developed. Classification of the Landsat TM data provides a means to map and quantify the degree of impervious surface area, an indicator of environmental quality, over large geographic areas and over time.",
