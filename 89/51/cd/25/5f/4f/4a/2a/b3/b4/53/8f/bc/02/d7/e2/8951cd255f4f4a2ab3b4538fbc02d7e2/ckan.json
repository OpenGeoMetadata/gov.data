  "notes": "  The overall goal of this Center is to better understand the effects of exposure in the womb to air pollutants and airborne bacteria on newborn health, immune system health during childhood, and to understand the relationship of these early-life exposures to asthma in children. Evidence suggests that exposure to air pollutants while in the womb may contribute to birth defects, the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S. Exposure to air pollutants is also linked to the development of asthma in children. The study is being conducted in California&amp;#39;s San Joaquin Valley, which has some of the highest levels of air pollutants in the country. As one of California&amp;#39;s fastest-growing areas, the region includes both industrial farming and expanding cities surrounded by mountains on three sides, which can trap air pollutants within the Central Valley.
