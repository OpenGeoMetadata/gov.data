    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this NASA STTR program is to develop conformal thin\nfilm sensors and sensor arrays for the direct measurement and mapping of\ndistributed skin friction on the surfaces of flight-test vehicles and\nwind tunnel models at DFRC and other NASA centers. NanoSonic would use\nits patented Metal Rubber&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n materials to fabricate the patterned &amp;quot;sensor skin&amp;quot; arrays.\nMetal Rubber&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n is a free-standing self-assembled nanocomposite that acts as a\ntransducer to convert shear stress into changes into electrical\nimpedance. During this program, NanoSonic would work cooperatively with\nVirginia Tech to develop an improved mechanical and electrical model of\nskin friction sensor performance that will allow quantitative\noptimization of material properties and suggest optimal methods for\nsensor attachment and use for NASA applications. We will perform\nsynthesis of sensor skin materials with optimized transduction,\nhysteresis and environmental properties, specifically for high Reynold's\nnumber flow and also varying temperature use. We will fabricate\npatterned two-dimensional sensor arrays and internal electronics using\noptimized materials. NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will perform complete\nanalysis of sensor cross-sensitivities and noise sources to allow\noptimization of signal-to-noise ratio and practical sensor sensitivity.\nSupport electronics will be developed to acquire, multiplex, store and\nprocess raw sensor array data. NanoSonic and Virginia Tech will also\nexperimentally validate sensor array performance through extended water\nand wind tunnel evaluation, and possible flight testing, and produce a\nfirst-generation skin friction sensor array and data acquisition\nelectronics system for sale.",
