  "notes": "LiDAR Bare-Earth Grid - Minnehaha Creek Watershed District. The Minnehaha Creek watershed is located primarily in Hennepin County, Minnesota. The watershed covers approximately 181 square miles in the western suburbs and Minneapolis, Minnesota, metropolitan area. It drains into the Mississippi River. It includes important natural resources such as Lake Minnetonka, Christmas Lake, Lake Nokomis, and Minnehaha Creek. The feasibility study has developed a Comprehensive Watershed Management Plan to assist in identifying project areas with a Federal and local interest. The focus of the remainder of the feasibility study will be on the following objectives: - Determine the flow regime in Minnehaha Creek that meets both human and ecosystem needs through a highly involved stakeholder process. - Modify the Grayâ€™s Bay Dam Operating plan to incorporate the revised flow regime. - Improve the chemical and physical quality of surface water both in creeks and lakes. Investigate options for improving the water quality in 6-Mile Creek/Halsted Bay. - Preserve and enhance connective ecosystems (greenway corridors) on creeks leading to Lake Minnetonka and along Minnehaha Creek. - Minimize man-made obstructions to recreational boating and fish passage along the creek. - Integrate public recreation features into multipurpose project formulation whenever possible. - Preserve, protect, and restore the natural appearance and function of riparian/shoreline ecosystems throughout the watershed. - Reduce the severity and frequency of flooding along Minnehaha Creek.",
