  "notes": " FUNCTION: Barny units measure ocean currents and sea surface heights on continental shelves and in ocean straits. SEPTR units are similar to Barnys but also record temperature and salinity (TS) profiles and transmit the data in near real time via satellite. The VMP500 is a vertical microstructure turbulence profiler for the measurement of dissipation-scale turbulence in oceans and lakes up to 500 m in depth. The ScanFish MKII is a towed undulating vehicle system for collecting 3D TS profile data of the water column. DESCRIPTION: Each Barny consists of a circular outer cement ring for ballast and impact protection, a buoyant main instrument housing, and a pop-up float. Each is equipped with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and wave/tide gauge. The pop-up float that contains the ADCP surfaces on an acoustic command, bringing with it a line for recovering the rest of the unit. Barnys are highly trawl-resistant. They were developed through a cooperative agreement between NRL and the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC). SEPTRs contain an additional pop-up float and record temperature, salinity, and optical parameters in addition to current profiles and pressure. The VMP500 is a freefalling probe that takes measurements on a downward trajectory and is capable of measuring full-depth profiles of thermal and kinetic energy dissipation rates, in addition to CTD and velocity fine structure in oceans and lakes. It is lightweight and deployable from small boats. The EIVA ScanFish MKII is a wing-shaped hydrofoil that &amp;quot; flies&amp;quot; through the water with ascent/descent controlled remotely; it is designed for high-speed data collection at either a fixed depth/altitude or on a preprogrammed undulating flight path. This allows for efficient and rapid 3D mapping of mesoscale oceanic features down to 400 m depth with scales ranging from about one meter to many tens of kilometers. INSTRUMENTATION: Each Barny hosts an RDI ADCP and Sea-Bird 026 wave/tide gauge. Each SEPTR contains a CTD, optical sensors, ADCP, and wave/tide gauge. The VMP contains a pressure sensor, 3-axis, high-accuracy accelerometer, SPM-38-1 shear probes, FP07-38-1 fast thermistors, SBE7-38 microstructure conductivity sensor,and SBE-3F/SBE-4C temperature and conductivity sensors. The ScanFish incorporates a Sea-Bird CTD and can host a variety of fast-response temperature and conductivity sensors and standard optics packages that include sensors such as the AC9, BB3, FL3, and transmissometer.
