    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Conflation and co-registration are critical applications for NASA, especially for co-registration of datasets differing in scale, resolution, sensor spectrum range (e.g. optical with IR or thermal imagery). Traditional georegistration solutions in the geospatial, photogrammetric, and computer vision communities select a set of control features in an existing database and identify the same features in an incoming dataset. However, these registration algorithms are not robust due to variations in scale, resolution, and sensor characteristics, where the identification of control features becomes a complex and challenging process. Recent NASA sponsored innovations include Feature Analyst (FA) automation with a registration scheme that is along the lines of traditional tools (e.g. use few control features to co-register two datasets). Here, we propose a new approach based object configuration similarity.  Our solution - a departure from traditional approaches ? uses abstract spatial relations (e.g. three square buildings forming an orthogonal triangle with a river running between them) as matching features, and transforms the registration problem into a spatial similarity assessment problem. Our approach results in unparalleled pull-in range as coarse location data are adequate to support the recovery of registration information for a configuration. ",
