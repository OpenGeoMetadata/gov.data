    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) facilities require the development of reliable systems for the disinfection of microorganisms.  There are several disinfectants that have been used, or proposed for use in CELSS facilities, including hypochlorite, iodine, ozone, silver, and quaternary ammonium compounds.  All of these compounds suffer from at least one of several major drawbacks:  (1) they are replaceable items and must be replaced after consumption; (2) in situ generation of the compound creates a safety concern; (3) in situ generation is not yet technically feasible; (4) in situ generation is incompatible with CELSS equipment infrastructure.  Additionally, many of these compounds have been linked to crew health problems after extended flight periods.  Substitution of these conventional biocides with a safe, antimicrobial compound for which in situ generation is safe and possible is urgently needed for crew safety, maintaining process equipment, and solid waste sanitation.  The aim of this project is to develop an on-demand electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generator that can be operated in microgravity from electrolysis of water with no consumable chemicals.  Hydrogen peroxide also has the potential to be regenerative within the overall system as it breaks down into water and oxygen during the sanitizing process.",
