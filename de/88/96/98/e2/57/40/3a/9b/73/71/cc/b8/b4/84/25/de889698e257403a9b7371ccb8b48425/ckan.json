  "notes": "This layer was obtained for inclusion in BIOS from the Chico State Geographic Information Center (GIC) Website. Permission to post these data in BIOS was provided to Eric Haney (ehaney@dfg.ca.gov) by Chuck Nelson of the GIC on 9/7/2007. These data can be downloaded along with the original layer (1991 - 1998) as well as similar layers for other regions of the Central Valley from http://www.gic.csuchico.edu/Veg_sac.html . These data should be used for riparian vegetation assessment purposes only. These data are not recommended for use at the project or parcel level. This Sacramento River Riparian Mapping 1999 effort is an update to the Sacramento River Riparian Mapping Project that was started in 1991 and completed in 1998. This project, however, was confined to the mainstem of the Sacramento River between Colusa on the south and Keswick Dam to the north. It is located in the Sacramento River Conservation Area (SRCA) approximately between River Mile 129 and RM 300. The mapping was completed in 2002 using aerial photography taken in 1999 for the Sacramento River Comprehensive Study. The airphotos were flown at the nominal scale of RF=1:7200 (1\"=600'). The project was funded by three agencies with a services match from the Geographical Information Center at California State University, Chico. Funding agencies included the California Department of Water Resources-Northern District Office, the California Wildlife Conservation Board, and The Nature Conservancy's Sacramento River Division. Polygons were heads-up digitized on-screen in ArcView from ortho-",
