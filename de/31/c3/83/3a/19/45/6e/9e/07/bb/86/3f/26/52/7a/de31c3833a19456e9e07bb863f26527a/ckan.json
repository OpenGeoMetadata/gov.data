    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Thermal control systems are sized for the maximum heat load in the warmest continuous environment.  This design process results in a larger radiator surface area than is needed for portions of a mission where the heat load is lower or the environment is colder.  Now that NASA is refocusing its human missions to the much colder areas of exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the need for a variable heat rejection thermal control system increases.  This SBIR project by ACT will develop a Variable Heat Rejection multi Loop Heat Pipe (VHR/mLHP) Radiator where the variable heat rejection feature will be provided by independently controlling the heat load for each LHP by heating and cooling the compensation chamber The proposed approach will use a series of individually controlled loop heat pipes (LHPs) receiving heat from a single phase pumped loop to perform the function of variable heat rejection while still closely controlling the loop setpoint temperature.  This technology development effort has three main objectives that build on mature LHP technology: optimization of the liquid/LHP heat exchanger, investigation of the use of heaters or thermoelectrics for temperature control and shutdown of the individual LHPs, and characterization of the system performance when multiple LHPs are assembled in series. The purpose of this program is to develop a holistic approach for a variable heat rejection system design consisting of multiple heat exchangers and multiple individually controlled LHPs which can achieve high turn down ratios for variable heat rejection while increasing the system reliability and reducing the system power and mass.  The proposed concept is flexible, as various configurations could be obtained to meet different mission parameters.  The main advantage of this technology development effort is that it leverages already proven technologies to integrate a novel system that can achieve robust variable heat rejection.",
