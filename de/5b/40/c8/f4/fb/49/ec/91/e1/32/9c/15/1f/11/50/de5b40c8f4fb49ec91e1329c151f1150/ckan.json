  "notes": "This dataset represents relative seabird abundance predictions from spatial models developed for the New York offshore spatial planning area. This raster was derived from multiple individual species season models. The model also includes spatially-explicit uncertainty estimates represented in another raster dataset. Raster values represent a dimensionless number scaled between 0 and 1, where values closer to 0 indicate greater certainty. The relative uncertainty value at each location is the same for all hotspot quantities (abundance, richness, and diversity index), because it is a function of the underlying trend and spatial model uncertainty for each species/group.",
