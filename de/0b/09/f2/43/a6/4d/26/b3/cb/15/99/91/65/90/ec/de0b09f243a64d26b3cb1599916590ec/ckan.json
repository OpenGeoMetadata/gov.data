    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Recent advances in propulsion, aerodynamic, and noise technologies have led to a revived interest in supersonic cruise aircraft; however, achieving economic viability for these vehicles requires dramatic improvements in cruise efficiency.  Optimization of inlet performance offers a potent method for achieving this goal, and a range of conceptual flow control systems are available to address critical problems like blockage, boundary layer bleed, duct length, and flow distortion.  By exploiting High Temperature Smart Memory Alloy (HTSMA) technologies, these concepts can be mechanized into robust, compact and lightweight devices, enabling actuators suitable integration into the inlets of supersonic aircraft.   The proposed effort leverages prior successful development of solid state smart structures by the investigators in developing of small scale surface-mounted flow control devices as well as large scale actuation systems for inlet ramp mechanisms actuated via HTSMA technology.  The proposed Phase II will build upon the Phase I proof of concept study to further develop a fully integrated active supersonic inlet system, including active inlet ramp and deployable flow control devices, as well as the aero/thermo/structural analysis models required to design such systems and subcomponents.  In addition, Phase II will be the continued refinement and characterization of actuator-ready HTSMAs.  ",
