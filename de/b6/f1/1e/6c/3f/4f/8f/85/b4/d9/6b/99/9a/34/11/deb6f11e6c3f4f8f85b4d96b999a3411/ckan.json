  "notes": " The Freshwater Treatment and Test Facility, located at SANGB, has direct year-round access to water from Lake St. Clair and has a State of Michigan approved National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that allows discharge of up to 500,000 gallons per day of fresh water back into the lake. Daily monitoring is conducted with monthly reports submitted to the state.  Capabilities:  The Freshwater Treatment and Test Facility has two 3,000-gallons-per-hour Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPUs); four 600-gallons-per-hour ROWPUs in types one, two and three; two 1,500-gallons-per-hour Tactical Water Purification Systems; and four Lightweight Water Purifiers, representing the majority of fielded systems in the Army inventory. These systems help resolve field issues, test new components and media, and support research on emerging technologies. The team also trains Soldiers on the equipment&amp;#39;s operation and maintenance. The Freshwater Treatment and Test Facility also has the capability to test and evaluate gray water recycle/reuse systems and system components using a test water developed by the Water Treatment and Handling Equipment Team based on gray water generated by shower and laundry systems used on military contingency bases. TARDEC also has access to the Seawater Desalination Test Facility, located at and operated by the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, CA. The Seawater Desalination Test Facility capabilities are comparable to the Freshwater Treatment and Test Facility but use natural seawater as the test water. TARDEC has two permanent employees stationed at Port Hueneme to support the Army&amp;#39;s water treatment and handling mission there, and to facilitate use of the facility.  Benefits:  &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Availability of most Army water purification equipment for use in test programs. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Controlled test environment with highly skilled operators. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Access to year-round testing using a natural water source within a controlled environment. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; New equipment and sustainment training on military water treatment equipment. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Ability to test and evaluate gray water treatment systems and components using contingency base representative gray water  ",
