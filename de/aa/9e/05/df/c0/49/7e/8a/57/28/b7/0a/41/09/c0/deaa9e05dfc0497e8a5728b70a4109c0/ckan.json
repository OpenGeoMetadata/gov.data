This coverage was created using locations listed in the AFO database and registrations submitted as part of the Iowa Plan. All registrations in the Iowa Plan were voluntary. Animal units were generally assigned as reported on registrations and construction permit applications, however, some numbers were modified based on Statement of Intent forms or site visits. Animal numbers should only be used as estimates. No quality control procedures were used to verify these animal numbers. The information contained in this coverage was developed from November, 2006, to March, 2007, therefore, any changes that were made to the AFO database during that time may not have been included. 52 operations were not mapped either because there was insufficient location information or because they were suspected to be duplicates of mapped operations.",
