  "notes": "This data set consists of digital water-level elevation contours for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake in east-central Oklahoma for 1982. Ground water in 710 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer, composed of alluvial and terrace deposits, consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The aquifer is underlain and in hydraulic connection with the upper zone of the Permian-age Garber-Wellington aquifer and the Pennsylvanian-age Ada-Vamoosa aquifer. Water-level elevation contours based on water-levels measured in 1982 and some water-levels measured prior to 1964 for wells completed in a terrace aquifer in the Oklahoma City area were digitized from a published report. Water-level elevations in this data set range from 1,280 feet above sea level in the west to 580 feet in the east. The water-level elevation contours were digitized from a mylar-base map at a scale of 1:250,000.",
