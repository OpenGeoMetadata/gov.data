    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "ZONA Technology, Inc (ZONA) and Arizona State University (ASU) propose a R&amp;D effort to develop a ground flutter testing system without wind tunnel, called the Dry Wind Tunnel (DWT) system. The DWT system consists of a ground vibration test (GVT) hardware system and a real-time unsteady aerodynamic force generation software developed from an aerodynamic reduced order model (ROM). The ground flutter test using the DWT system operates on the real structural model, thereby no scale-down structural model is involved.  Furthermore, the impact of the structural nonlinearities on the aeroelastic stability can be automatically included.  Moreover, the aeroservoelastic characteristics of the aircraft can be easily measured by simply including the flight control system in the loop.  In addition, the unsteady aerodynamics generated computationally is interference-free from the wind tunnel walls.  Finally, the DWT can be conveniently and inexpensively carried out as a post GVT test with the same hardware. In Phase I, we will validate this DWT concept on a rectangular flat plate with a reference flutter solution. Through this validation process, the most significant hardware issues will be resolved to pave the way for a successful Phase II validation on a complex structure, such as a real aircraft. ",
