    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Pathfinder Program, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is tasked to produce long-term data sets for global change research. The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) Pathfinder Level 2 Land Products data set has been generated using the land classification algorithms developed by Neale, and the land surface temperature algorithms developed by McFarland. This data set includes both the land classification and land surface temperature products.  The Pathfinder Level 2 Land Products data set is in swath format. Coverage is global land surface, and covers 1 August 1987 through 31 March 1988. Data are available via ftp on request.\n\nThe SSM/I Pathfinder Level 3 Land Products data set has been generated using the Level 2 data described above. The Level 2 data were interpolated to a longitude-latitude grid with a resolution of one degree. For the Benchmark Period, the data were averaged over periods of five days (a pentad) or one month, although, for the land classification product, the most commonly occurring land class (the mode of the distribution within each bin) was chosen as the class for that bin and for the period. The data set, including both pentad and monthly grids, covers 1 August 1987 through 31 December 1988.",
