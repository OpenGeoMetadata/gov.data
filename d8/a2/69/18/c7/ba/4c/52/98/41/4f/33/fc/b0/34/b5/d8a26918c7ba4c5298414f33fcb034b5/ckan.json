  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified backscatter GeoTiff with 1x1 meter cell size representing the 2014 Long Island Sound Benthic Habitat Priority Area of Interest off of Port Jefferson, NY. This backscatter dataset is a mosaic of surveys from the NOAA Ship S-222 Thomas Jefferson and its two inshore launch vessels, the NOAA Ship S-590 Rude, as well as surveys conducted by the University of Rhode Island and Stony Brook University in coordination with the NOAA Biogeography Branch and the Integrated OCean and Coastal Mapping Branch between 2001 and 2013. Backscatter data was collected using multibeam sonars and side scan sonars and mosaiced into a raster using ArcGIS 10.1 and Envi 5.0 software at the Biogeography Branch by a NOAA contractor.",
