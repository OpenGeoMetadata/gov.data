The subject file represents the Arkansas portion of the Intermodal Terminal Facilities data set contains geographic data for trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) and container-on-flatcar (COFC) highway-rail and/or rail-water transfer facilities in Arkansas. The locations of TOFC/COFC facilities were determined using available facility address information and MapExpert, a commercial nationwide digital map database and software package, and recording the longitude/latitude of the approximate center of the facility. Facility locations are not bound to any current or previous highway, railway, or waterway network models. After completing topological and attribute verification using ARC/INFO, the data was extracted and reformatted into the BTS ACSII format. The scale and resolution of this data set and source data are unknown.",
