    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;objective of this project&amp;nbsp;is to test a new approach for selecting the optimal solar wind model from an ensemble of model runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the paucity of real time solar wind measurements, numerical heliospheric models are an essential element in space weather forecasting. At any given time coupled corona/inner heliosphere models can be generated from a number of available solar photospheric synoptic magnetograms. Validation studies have shown that the average error of the ensemble of models when forecasting the arrival time of geo-effective fast wind streams is typically 1 to 2 days. Usually one or more of the models at a given time gives a significantly better forecast than the average, but over a solar cycle, no synoptic magnetogram source clearly outperforms any other.&amp;nbsp; There has been no way, in near real time, to identify which magnetogram source leads to the best forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;nbsp;propose to test a new approach, which uses observations of structure in the solar wind close to the Sun obtained from the STEREO A and B Heliospheric imagers. By identifying which of the possible forecast models best fits the Heliospheric Imager data,&amp;nbsp;the expectation is&amp;nbsp;to be able to significantly improve the forecasts of the arrival times of fast solar wind streams at Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WSA-ENLIL model is acknowledged to be the most physically complete model of the inner heliosphere currently in active use for solar wind forecasting. Therefore&amp;nbsp;the WSA-ENLIL model was&amp;nbsp;chosen to use it to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach. The first deliverable at the end of this project will be an updated version of the WSA-ENLIL model, configured to run in ensemble mode using a different synoptic magnetogram source for each run of the model, and with newly developed routines supporting acquisition and use of the Heliospheric Imager data, and automatic identification of the optimal forecast run. The second deliverable will be a validation study of the new approach reporting the improvements achieved in forecasting fast stream arrival times.&amp;nbsp;The initial goal is not to deliver an operational forecasting tool, but to demonstrate that this approach has the capability to dramatically improve forecast quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of follow on efforts would be to refine and optimize the procedure, and to modularize components so they can be used with alternative coupled corona/inner heliosphere models in use in both the operational forecasting community and the scientific research community. In addition by demonstrating that the new procedure will significantly improve forecast quality, we would support advocacy of any flight missions which would provide a Heliospheric Imaging capability comparable to that which is currently available from STEREO A and B.&lt;/p&gt;",
