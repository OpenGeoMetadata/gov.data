    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As software and software intensive systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, the impact of failures can be tremendous. In some industries such as aerospace, medical devices, or automotive, such failures can cost lives or endan- ger mission success. Software faults can arise due to the inter- action between the software, the hardware, and the operating environment. Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission. Latent coding errors can at any time during system operation trigger faults despite the fact that usually a significant effort has been expended in verification and validation (V&V) of the software system. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly more apparent that pre-deployment V&V is not enough to guarantee that a com- plex software system meets all safety, security, and reliabil- ity requirements. Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies, while the system is in operation. The prognos- tic capability of the SWHM to detect and diagnose failures before they happen will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future. This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline and motivates the need for SWHM in safety critical applications.",
