  "notes": "The purpose of this handbook is to provide information to contaminant specialists involved in evaluating agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands. The handbook describes the major types of agricultural chemicals used in the prairie pothole region, their effects on wildlife and habitat, and methods to investigate impacts. Background information on nonpoint source pollution is provided as well as general guidelines on preventing contamination. The handbook begins by introducing safe handling of suspected chemical pollution in wetlands. The description and general uses of agricultural chemicals are discussed next. Major pathways of chemical contamination and effects of pesticides are also covered. This handbook provides technical guidelines for evaluating non-point source contamination of wetlands by agricultural chemicals. The handbook is intended to be a convenient, useful, and comprehensive reference for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel involved in the evaluation of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands and migratory birds. The handbook also stresses the safety of individuals investigating possible chemical contamination. It is designed to be a ready reference during the planning phase of investigations of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands. While practices included here are designed for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, other cooperating agencies or groups may find the information useful when performing similar duties. The handbook may provide guidance to landowners and others wishing to minimize chemical impacts on wildlife as well as provide advice on best management practices. Information in the handbook is based on Federal laws, Executive orders, regulations, Department of Interior policies, and results of scientific research. This handbook has been prepared by the South Dakota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Division for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Offices. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Offices have one or more contaminant specialists that are responsible for evaluating the effects of chemicals on wetlands.",
