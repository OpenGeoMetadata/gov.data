The general soil map is at a scale of 1:63360. These maps provide information that will help to plan effective use of land areas greater than about 25 acres in the county. For more detailed information, please consult the published soil survey which contains soil maps at a scale 1:20,000. The soil interpretations developed for the selected specific uses, are be [by] necessity, general in nature, and are based on the dominant soil conditions that occur within each delineated soil association area. Larger scale soil maps, showing more detailed soil separations, are needed for the more detailed soil interpretations. On-site evaluations for specific sites, made prior to construction, are needed to determine suitability or limitations of the specific use. Investigations and interpretation apply to a depth of 5 or 6 feet. Soil properties do not function independently of each other. The effect of one property is influenced by other associated properties.\\\" The following statement must be included with any products that use or are derived from this data set: Data contained in this product was originally produced by the Tompkins County Planning Department, the Tompkins County ITS GIS Division, and the USDA Soil Conservation Service and may not be reproduced or redistributed without the express written consent of the originators.
