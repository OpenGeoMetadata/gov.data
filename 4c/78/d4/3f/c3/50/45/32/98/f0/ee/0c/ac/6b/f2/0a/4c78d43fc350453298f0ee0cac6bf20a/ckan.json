This data set is a point coverage with attributes of sampling point environment and can be linked to the results of chemical (hydrocarbon) analysis of a composite soil sample obtained at each point. The data were obtained at nearly 1200 points covering the 'coastal' waters of Louisiana and points along the Mississippi River, the Atchafalaya Navigation Channel, the Red River, and the Ouachita-Black River. These data represent the sampling points for the 1997-1998 sampling year.",
