    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal offers to develop a comprehensive computer simulation methodology based on the finite element method for the simulation of the electron beam freeform fabrication process.  It will utilize the successful accomplishments of Phase I project. The following major tasks are proposed for Phase II;  (1) a user subroutine to model Gaussian distribution of the heat input, (3) a new highly sophisticated thermal model of material deposition, (4) a user subroutine for the prediction of microstructure with graphical representation of the output, (5) study of convection in the melt pool to determine its shape,  (6) fabrication of three different types of samples and measurements of microstructure, residual stresses and distortions, and (7) computer simulation of the samples using all models developed under the program for their verification.  A thermo-mechanical code ABAQUS will be the primary simulation tool.  A computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, will be used for the study of the melt pool shape.  These models will be applicable to ground-based as well as space-based EB systems.  They will also be applicable to laser, TIG and other deposition processes.  A strategy for the commercialization of the methodology and products is discussed.  \r\n\r\n",
