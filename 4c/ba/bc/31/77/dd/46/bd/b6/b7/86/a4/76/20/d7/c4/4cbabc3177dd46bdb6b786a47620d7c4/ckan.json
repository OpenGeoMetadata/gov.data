    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Many scientists have the common need of visualizing data in a collaborative and interactive manner.  In a modern environment, these data are often stored across a widely distributed network and the researchers themselves are just as often separated by large geographical distances.  Traditional visualization and collaboration approaches require the local installation of software specific to each end user as well as the downloading of data to each local machine.  The proposed innovation would provide researchers with an environment that allows them to visualize remote data using the standard and familiar web browser as the application platform.  No proprietary software need be installed and no data has to be downloaded to local machines.  Furthermore, multiple researchers can interactively explore data via visualization in a joint session where changes by one researcher are seamlessly seen by the others.  The architecture is based on technologies underlying state of the art web applications such as Google Maps.  Employing a modular design using web services as means to connect the modules, the environment is easy to modify and improve as new data access, rendering, and client-side display technologies mature and become available.",
