    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The OMI Earth Surface Reflectance Climatology product, OMLER (Global 0.5deg Lat/Lon grid) which is based on Version 003 Level-1B top of atmosphere upwelling radiance and incoming irradiance, is now available ( http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omler_v003.shtml ) from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). \n                        \nOMI calibrated and geolocated radiances from 159 channels in UV1(264-311 nm), 557 channels in UV2 (307-383 nm) and 751 channels in VIS (349-504) spectral  regions, spectral irradiances, calibration measurements, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products (Level-2 and 3) are archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC.\n                              \n(The shortname for this OMI Level-3 Product is OMLER) \nThe lead algorithm scientists for this product are KNMI scientists Dr. Quintus Kleipool and Dr. Marcel Dobber.      \n                              \nOMLER spectral surface reflectance product contains monthly and yearly climatology of the Earth's surface Lambert Equivalent Reflectance (LER) for 23 wavelengths in the spectral range 309 to 500 nm, at a spatial resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 degrees. This LER is defined as the required reflectance of an isotropic surface needed to match the observed top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in a pure Rayleigh scattering atmosphere under cloud free conditions and no aerosols. The climatology is based on statistical analysis of the three years of OMI version 03 radiance data (Oct 2004-Oct 2007).  This product also provides minimum spectral surface reflectivity observed for each 0.5 deg Lat/Lon grid during the three years period. \n                         \nThe OMLER product file is produced in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). It is roughly 300 MB in size. For browsing and extracting data from Aura data files, some software and tools have been made available from the Aura GES DISC tools site:    http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml\n                        \nA Readme document containing brief algorithm description and file spec provided by the OMLER Algorithm lead is available from the GES DISC data product site  http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omler_v003.shtml",
