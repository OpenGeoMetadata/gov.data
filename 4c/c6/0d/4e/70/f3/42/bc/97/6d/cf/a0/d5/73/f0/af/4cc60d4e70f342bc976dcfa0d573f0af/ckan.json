    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA has a pressing need for increasing the efficiency of launch range\nsurveillance during mission launch operations. Difficulty in verifying a\ncleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly\naffect the operation safety, cost and schedule. We propose this SBIR to\ndevelop a novel &amp;quot;Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor&amp;quot;\nplatform, especially suited for detection, tracking, recognition, and\nidentification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the\nrange that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations.\nConventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They\nobserve objects through a small solid angle subtended in front of the\nsensor. Although the high optical amplification may provide high\nresolution image of a target, detecting and tracking potential target\nwithin a large area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time,\ncostly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency of verifying range clearance, even\nmissing intruded target due to limited FOV. Increasing FOV, however, is\na double-edged sword that, for any given sensor, leads to a decreased\nspatial resolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and\nclassification. To address these contradicting requirements on FOV and\nresolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart\nPTZ sensor concept with the following unique advantages: (1)Novel\noptical design of wide FOV optics, no blind spot, no image distortion;\n(2)Simultaneous wide FOV and zoomed high resolution images; (3)Smart PTZ\ntarget tracking; (4)Intelligent video analysis algorithms for automatic\ntarget detection and tracking; (5)Embedded on-board DSP processing\nmodule; (6)Novel optical design applies to both visible and infrared\nsensors; (7)Flexible mounting options: on-board UAV, land vehicle\nmounted, and fixed camera.",
