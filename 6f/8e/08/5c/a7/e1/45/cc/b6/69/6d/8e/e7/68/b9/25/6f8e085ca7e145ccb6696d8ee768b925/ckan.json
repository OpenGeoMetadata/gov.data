  "notes": " The Ground Vehicle Power Laboratory, located within the Ground Systems Power and Energy Laboratory (GSPEL), can test vehicle power generation systems up to 40kW, including multiplealternator/generator systems. Lab modularity allows up to three alternator/generator systems physically configured to run concurrently, with electrical buses either separate or together. The lab can test a complete system installed in the vehicle, or on a test bench, under controlled conditions from minus 80&amp;#176; F to 250&amp;#176; F. Capabilities The lab provides complete life-cycle support for ground vehicles&amp;#39; onboard power generation and fielded electrical systems. Support includes development, testing, integration and troubleshooting for vehicle power generation and fielded electrical systems. Environmental conditions for each portion of an electrical system can be simulated simultaneously, up to four at a time. Electrical integration of the power generation system can be performed concurrently or prior to physical integration with the bench test area located adjacent to vehicle bays. Benefits &amp;#8226;  Integration, physical and electrical, of vehicle power  generation systems is performed concurrently in a rapid-fielding program. &amp;#8226;  Field electrical issues are addressed quickly to  reconfigure different tests. &amp;#8226;  Vehicle electrical systems - including power  generation - can be tested in relevant environmental conditions throughout the developmental cycle to ensure a system&amp;#39;s technology readiness level will meet program requirements on schedule. &amp;#8226;  The ability to run all portions of electrical systems on  the vehicle, or on a test bench in controlled environmental conditions, provides a complete lifecycle support lab for vehicle power generation and electrical systems.
