    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "With recent advancements in prognostics methodologies there has been a significant interest in maturing Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) to increase its technology readiness level for onboard deployments. Active research is underway both in industry and academia to address shortcomings in availability of run-to-failure data, accelerated aging environments, real-time prognostics algorithms, uncertainty representation and management (URM) techniques, prognostics performance evaluation, etc., to name a few. At this juncture it is highly desirable to close the loop by connecting the high level customer requirements for mission planning and execution to performance specifications for prognostics methodologies at the lower technical level. This calls for integrating the pragmatics of safety, reliability, cost, and real-time viability into the prognostics methodologies to establish a connection between top-down and bottom-up approaches currently pursued in the PHM community. In this paper we identify key areas that must be addressed to bridge these gaps and provide an overview of how these areas have been addressed in part at various levels. We also discuss on how these issues can be further developed into a comprehensive and more coherent portfolio of technologies that will ultimately lead to specifying guidelines for prognostics performance.",
