  "notes": "  The Biomedical Engineering and Physical Science (BEPS) shared resource supports NIH&amp;#39;s intramural basic and clinical scientists on applications of engineering, physics, imaging, measurement and analysis. BEPS is centrally located on the main NIH campus, and provides expertise that spans technologies ranging in scale from near-atomic resolution to intact organisms. Please click on the links below to learn more about BEPS&amp;#39;s six Units:      Electron Microscopy Unit  The Electron Microscopy Unit provides instrumentation, training, and services for: immuno electron microscopy, electron tomography, and specimen preparation, including cryo-techniques.    Infrared Imaging and Thermometry Unit  The Infrared Imaging and Thermometry Unit provides expertise, instrumentation, and training for: intraoperative and bedside optical imaging of tissue (perfusion, oxygenation, and temperature), passive microwave thermometry, multi-spectral imaging without contrast agents, and remote sensing for clinical research using cellphone technology.    Micro Analytical Immunochemistry  The Micro Analytical Immunochemistry Unit specializes in micro-immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis, multianalyte QuansysTM ELISA arrays, custom immunoassays for microliter and sub-microliter samples, and characterization of biological molecule interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).    Microfabrication and Microfluidics  The Microfabrication and Microfluidics Unit specializes in: rapid design and fabrication of microfluidic devices from single or multilayer templates, microfabrication in silicon/glass, PDMS, thermoplastics, and agarose, structured surface modification, including micro contact printing, and plasma treatment of PDMS devices for irreversible bonding or for surface activation.    Quantitative Methods for Macromolecular Interactions  The Quantitative Methods for Macromolecular Interactions (QMMI) Unit specializes in the following: biophysical characterization of individual macromolecules and their interactions, measurement of solution-phase molecular weight, sedimentation coefficients, and translational diffusion coefficients, hydrodynamic radii, and overall asymmetry of macromolecules or their assemblies, establishment of the stoichiometry of complexes, and insight into secondary structure or changes in structure upon ligand binding.    Scanning Probe Microscopy Unit  The Scanning Probe Microscopy Unit specializes in nanoscale imaging of molecular complexes, lipid bilayers, cells and tissues, molecular recognition, protein unfolding, force spectroscopy, high resolution viscoelastic property mapping, correlated AFM and fluorescence microscopy, and mathematical modeling, image analysis, finite element analysis.
