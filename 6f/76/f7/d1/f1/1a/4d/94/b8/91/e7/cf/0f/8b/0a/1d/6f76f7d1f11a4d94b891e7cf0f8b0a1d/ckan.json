  "notes": "Mercury and poor water quality in the Atchafalaya River Basin have been documented by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality’s Mercury Monitoring Program. The Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi River in the Lower Mississippi River ecosystem, receives most of its volume by way of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s Old River Control Structure. This study assessed potential biological and ecotoxicological impacts of mercury contamination on resources in the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Forty largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were collected by electroshocking in December 1996 and October 1997. Samples were analyzed for tissue mercury levels, liver enzyme activity (EROD), DNA integrity in blood cells, reproductive hormone levels, vitellogenin (Vg) levels, percentage of white blood cells, percentage of phagocytes, macrophage aggregates (MA) and parasites in spleen tissue, and health assessments as per the Biomonitoring and Environmental Status and Trends Program. Wet weight mercury levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.52 ppm. Largemouth bass had elevated EROD activity (decontamination enzymes) in both males and females, but carp did not have elevated EROD activity in either gender. Mercury level was correlated with increased EROD (p=0.0001). Aneuploidy was demonstrated with blood from one carp, where tissue mercury levels were significantly, positively correlated with an increase in DNA coefficient of variation (CV) (p=0.0012). Spleen weights were positively correlated with increased DNA CV (p=0.0236). Vg (egg protein precursor) was found in one male carp. Splenic parasites were prevalent in two fish. Bass spleens had significantly fewer MA than carp spleens (p=0.0247), but significantly more area of tissue was involved (p=0.0003). Tissue mercury levels were significantly, negatively correlated with overall gonadosomatic index for both species (p<0.0001), and when separated by sex (male, p=0.0002 and female, p=0.0001). For carp, there was a significant negative correlation for the percent of phagocytes (p=0.0492), indicating possible immunosuppression. The study of biomarker responses of two fish species with different life histories provided a thorough assessment of an ecosystem experiencing low dissolved oxygen and anthropogenic inputs.",
