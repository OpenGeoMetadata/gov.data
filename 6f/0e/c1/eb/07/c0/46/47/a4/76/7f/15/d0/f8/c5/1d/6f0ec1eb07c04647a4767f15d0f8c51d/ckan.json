  "notes": "Idaho State Assessment of Forest Resource Final Report The Statewide Assessment of Forest Resources (SAFR) is a geospatial analysis of forest conditions and trends in Idaho. The Idaho SAFR identifies seven main issues affecting Idaho forestlands (threats and potential benefits). Potential threats to forests include forest health decline, uncharacteristic wildfire, development pressure and recreation in undesignated areas. Potential benefits include sustainable wood-based forest resource markets, water quality & quantity, air quality, and wildlife habitat and biodiversity. A series of sub-issue datasets inform each of the primary issues. Together, statewide data and local knowledge identified areas in Idaho where these threats and benefits pointed to the highest need for investment and work. These areas of multiple high priority concerns and potential benefits were designated as Priority Landscape Areas (PLAs) and include urban, rural, and wildland urban-interface (WUI) lands. Note that the SAFR utilized the best available statewide data. Because the SAFR is statewide in scale, it does not identify every area in which an issue may be found. Local geospatial data may present a different characterization of the issues. The SAFR report describes each issue, the sub-issues each was comprised of, the data used and how it was modeled, and data considered but not used and why. In addition to the Idaho State Forest Resource Assessment report, information on the development of the SAFR, including meeting minutes, interim reports and more can be found on the SAFR website at: www.idl.idaho.gov/bureau/ForestAssist/safr_index.html. Geospatial data for the seven primary issues, the composite threats, composite benefits, final assessment map and priority landscape areas are also available on Inside Idaho.",
