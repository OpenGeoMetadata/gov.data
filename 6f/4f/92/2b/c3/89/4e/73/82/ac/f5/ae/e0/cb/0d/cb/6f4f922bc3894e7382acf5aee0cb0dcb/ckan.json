  "notes": "Potential risk to ecological receptors in He’eia Stream and Wetland was characterized through the use of a food-web model to predict effects to the Hawaiian stilt, chosen as a representative species for all waterbirds. It was assumed that risk estimates for Hawaiian stilt would support management decisions that would be protective enough for other avian receptors as well as native aquatic biota. Risk estimation involved a hazard quotient methodology to calculate critical exposure levels for individual stilt. If an exposure point concentration exceeded the critical exposure level for a particular CPEC, then the potential for adverse ecological effects was indicated. The model predicted that seven of the CPECs (total DDT, dieldrin, PCB Aroclors 1254 and 1260, barium, manganese, and vanadium) posed some level of ecological risk. The majority of exposure to organic CPECs in this model was obtained through fish consumption. Exposure to risk-posing metals was variably partitioned among fish, invertebrate, and sediment consumption. Based on the results of the field study, exposure assessment, ecological effects assessment, food-web model, and lines of evidence examined, all but five CPECs were eliminated from further consideration in the risk assessment. The five contaminants identified to constitute a risk to ecological receptors in He'eia Stream and He'eia Wetland were total DDT, dieldrin, PCB Aroclor 1254, barium, and manganese. Since indications of potential adverse effects to offsite ecological receptors were not necessarily the result of past practices at the Omega Station, the distribution patterns of these five CPECs in sediments and tissues were closely evaluated for evidence of their relationship to the Omega Station site. Results of this evaluation were as follows: Total DDT and Dieldrin - appeared to be attributable to a local source of DDT in the vicinity of lower Heteia Stream. PCB Aroclor 1254 - insufficient data to attribute or disqualify the Omega Station as the source. Barium - may be attributable to Omega Station activities. Manganese - data indicate a depleted source that is equally affecting the lower stream and wetland system at He'eia. It is possible that this source may be the Omega Station. Due to the overall level of uncertainty in the risk assessment and the fact that contaminant \"hot spots\" in Heteia Stream and He'eia Wetland have not been delineated, contaminants found offsite of the Omega Station do not warrant cleanup at this time. However, additional studies targeting PCB Aroclor 1254, barium, and manganese are justified since these were shown to pose ecological risk and could potentially have come from the Omega Station. He'eia Wetland is a dynamic environment, affected by intermittent flooding and drying. Therefore, organic contaminants may be widely dispersed. Several follow-up studies were recommended to help clarify the need for delineation and cleanup of contaminant \"hot spots” caused by past activities at the Omega Station. The following general conclusions were drawn from the ecological risk assessment: * The main receiving medium of concern is sediments, which may contain residual levels of contaminants transported from the Omega Station site. * The primary exposure pathways are ingestion of contaminated sediment and bioaccumulation along the food web. * Dieldrin was the most ubiquitous contaminant found in this study. With the highest hazard quotient and strong lines of evidence, it appeared to pose the greatest relative risk to He'eia Stream and Wetland receptors. However, the Omega Station was not shown to be a source of dieldrin contamination. * The lines of evidence presented herein suggested that there is little to no risk of acute or short-term chronic impacts to ecological receptors in He'eia Stream and Wetland. However, no predictions can be made regarding the long-term survival, growth, and reproduction of native aquatic biota, endangered waterbirds, and migratory birds.",
