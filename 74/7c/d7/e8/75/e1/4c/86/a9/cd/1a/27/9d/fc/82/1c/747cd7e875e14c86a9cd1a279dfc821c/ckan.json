    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;For the first two years of the project (FY12-13), the RadWorks project has consisted of two top-level elements. The first element involved the prototype and maturation of advanced, miniaturized radiation measurement technologies, and demonstration through available platforms of these technologies as integrated vehicle systems. The second element was the provision of ground based hardware and virtual demonstrators of radiation storm-shelter capabilities by providing multi-functionality in design elements, utilizing existing launch mass as compared to methods involving the addition of dedicated shielding mass. For FY14, the RadWorks project is continuing its maturation and prototyping of advanced, miniaturized radiation measurement technologies, along with their demonstrations. The RadWorks project will fly a simplified, non-integrated version of Radiation Environment Monitor (REM) aboard the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) to validate system operation in a space radiation environment and record charged particle data for post-flight analysis. This REM unit has been designated as the Battery-Operated Independent Radiation Detector (BIRD).&amp;nbsp;In addition, there are&amp;nbsp;6 REM sensors flying as Detailed Test Objectives (DTO) on the International Space Station (ISS). These sensors are plugged into laptops and are measuring the ionizing radiation environment. Work will continue on the development of the Hybrid Electronic Radiation Assessor (HERA) which is slated to fly first as a FTO (Flight Test Objective) on the MPCV Experimental Module 1 (EM-1) flight, and secondly, as an integrated part of the CWS (Caution &amp;amp; Warning System) on the MPCV Experimental Module 2 (EM-2) flight. Lastly, the RadWorks project will continue its development of an Advanced Neutron Spectrometer (ANS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in FY14, the Storm Sheltering element of the project will transition away from specific shelter designs toward utilizing recently developed radiation modeling expertise, and modeling databases for comparison of simulation results to actual data. Comparative assessments will be conducted to correlate REM DTO data to radiation models, as applied to the current ISS configuration. Also, the RadWorks project will advance the development of radiation transport analytical software. This work will enable new designs and concepts of operation for radiation mitigation and protection of crew.&lt;/p&gt;",
