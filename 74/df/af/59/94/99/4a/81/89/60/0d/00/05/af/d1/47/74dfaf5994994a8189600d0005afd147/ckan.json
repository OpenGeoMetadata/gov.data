  "notes": "These data consists of watershed delineations in one seamless dataset of drainage areas called Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Level 02 Watersheds. DNR Level 02 Watersheds are the largest administrative Minnesota watershed unit delineation existing at the 2nd defined level in the Minnesota DNR watershed unit hierarchy. These modern DNR Level 02 Watersheds are derived from the DNR Catchment base-watershed dataset and have been clipped to the Minnesota state boundary. Unlike DNR Levels 01, 04 (Major), and 07 (Minor) Watersheds, DNR Level 02 watersheds have no corresponding legacy dataset. For a more detailed background on this data, follow this link to the paper DNR Watershed Project: History, Methodology, Terminology, Attributes 2009(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us:8080/gis/ancillary/DNR_Watershed_Project_History_Methodology_Terminology_Attributes_2009.pdf) document (PDF).
