  "notes": "2006, 6 inch Pixel Color Orthophotography - - Panchromatic, red, green, blue and near infrared imagery was acquired using the Leica ADS40 multi-spectral scanner (see Appendix B: Aerial Imagery and Ground Control Layout). The imagery was captured from an altitude of 6,336' AGL, providing a raw ground sample distance of 0.66-feet. A total of 60 flight lines of imagery (see Appendix B: Aerial Imagery and Ground Control Layout) were acquired over 5 sessions conducted between February 14 and March 15, 2006 (see Aerial Triangulation Report, 2006 Volusia Countywide DOI Project, Dated December 2006). ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### This data set is one component of a digital terrain model (DTM) developed for Volusia County, Florida in 2006 under contract number RSQ 06-SQ-06RB, project number P5409, Professional Consuting Services for LiDAR Surveys, Digital Topographic Data and Digital Orthophotography. As part of the 2006 Task Assignment 1, LiDAR and digtial color imagery data was acquired across the county, +/-1,427 square miles. The digital imagery was used to develop orthophotos over the entire county, and it was used to support DTM development (QC of LiDAR data and breakline compilation) over 3 drainage basins: Spruce Creek, Deland Ridge and Deep Creek Closed, totaling 361 county grid tiles at 5,000' by 5,000' or 323.7 square miles. The LiDAR data was used to develop a DEM for orthophoto rectification purposes only, and it was used to support DTM development. ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### Aerial Triangulation - - Aerial triangulation was performed to extend or densify the network of control points established by the ground control survey. Aerial triangulation provides the proper number and pattern of control points for each stereo model derived from the imagery strips. This data is necessary to orient the imagery to the ground for the QC of LiDAR data and the rectification of raster images. For a detailed overview of the aerial triangulation, refer to: Woolpert Aerial Triangulation Report, 2006 Volusia Countywide DOI Project, dated December 2006. ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### Digital Orthophoto Imagery (DOI) - - Color (RGB) DOI was developed by rectifying the digital aerial imagery to correct for aircraft tilt, terrain relief, and camera lens distortion. Overlapping nadir images were derived from the triangulated flight lines. Full differential rectification was then performed on each derived image using the Z/I Imaging Corporation Base Rectifier software. Image mosaicking was performed between adjacent rectified images using OrthoVista software, version 3.3.0, developed by Stellacore Corporation of Parker, Colorado, and distributed by Inpho of Estes Park, Colorado. Processing for orthorectification and image mosaicking was performed on photogrammetric workstations. After rectifying all of the digital aerial imagery, a controlled mosaic was developed from the individual digital orthophotography images to create a continuous base map. Orthorectification and mosaicking were performed at a 0.5-foot pixel resolution. One-thousand five hundred and ninety-one (1,591) individual image tiles were extracted from the mosaic based on the county's 5,000' by 5,000' tile system. For each image tile, an ArcINFO world file was generated to georeference the DOI within the ArcINFO environment. ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### Accuracy Checks - - The horizontal accuracy of the DOI was field verified and the results of those field verifications are included in Appendix F: DOI Accuracy Analysis. ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### References - - http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/nmas.htm - UGSG Internet Site for National Map Accuracy Standards Woolpert MTS Report of Photogrammetric Ground Control Survey: LiDAR Surveys, Digital Topographic Data and Digital Orthophotograph, 2006 Volusia County Project No. P-5409 - Task Order 1 April 26, 2006.
