  "notes": "The 2012 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based shapefiles while others are available only as state-based files.",
