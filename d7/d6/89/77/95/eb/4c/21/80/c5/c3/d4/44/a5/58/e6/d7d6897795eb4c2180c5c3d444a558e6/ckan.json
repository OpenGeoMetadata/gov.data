  "notes": " The HAD provides technology assessment, subject-matter expert (SME) integration services and evaluations for PMs as well as core-funded DoD projects. Technologies addressed include Passive and Active Protection Systems (APS). HAD provides unbiased &amp;quot;honest broker&amp;quot; technology evaluations. The lab also works with industry via Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), collaborating with partners to improve on available technologies for potential transition to the PM community.  Capabilities: HAD can characterize threat-point initiators, countermeasure pre-function analysis, technology optimization and system integration. Based on customer input, the lab develops theater-inspired complex attack scenarios to evaluate proposed solutions. HAD optimizes technology integrations based on performance data provided by these complex ambush scenarios. APS technology is assessed for vehicle-specific integrations in a hardware-in-the-loop, virtual battle space environment.  Benefits:  &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Provides real-time evaluations and assessments. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Optimizes technology concepts against theater-based complex attacks. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Optimizes integration of passive and active defeat systems on tactical and combat vehicles. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Provides a one-team approach to the hit avoidance system optimizations and integration with controlled firing of dynamic threat surrogates and the Rapid Evaluation Capability of live-fire dynamic foreign threats.
