    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "C-CAT, which has proven carbon-carbon fabrication capabilities, will investigate use of ACC-6 High Melt oxidation protective system on carbon-carbon for use on the Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propellant Space Engine nozzle and nozzle extensions.  \r\n\r\nACC-6 High Melt is a carbon-carbon coating application that embeds HfC,ZrB2 in the outer layers.  This material system has been tested in Arc Jet environment at over 3000 degrees F, for more than 24 minutes with little to no erosion.  ACC-6 High Melt has shown to be the best performing high temperature material system, and still retains the ease of manufacturing associated with carbon-carbon.\r\n\r\nACC-6 High Melt has been manufactured in small scale leading edge experiments, but has yet to be demonstrated in large components.  Manufacturability of large scale components remains as the main question to be answered for this material system.  For Phase I, C-CAT proposes to build subsections of a nozzle extension representing the attach flange and the exit diameter of approximately 40\" diameter. Success will be achieved by manufacturing the aforementioned subsection using ACC-6 High Melt with no voids or spalling of coating.  This successful demonstration will provide the path for scale-up to a full size prototype nozzle extension for Phase II. \r\n ",
