    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Under files is the link to the RTI wiki. \r\n\r\nResearch Test and Integration (RTI) focuses on the development of long term plans for test and integration opportunities for research products from the SSAT, VSST, and AEST projects. RTI planning is primarily focused on AvSafe projects, however collaboration also includes other NASA programs, other government agencies, as well as industry and academic partners. This Wiki is intended to document the Research Test and Integration Plan (RTIP). The purpose of RTIP is to keep track of significant AvSafe research activities and maintain a database of testing facilities and assets available to enable and enhance the AvSafe research milestones. In addition RTIP will facilitate the development of collaborative research testing plans. This research collaboration will enable pooling research and test activities where possible. This pooling of research and test activities has the possibility of creating benefits that include: \r\n\r\n1. increasing the Technology Readiness Level for test activities with little or no additional cost to perform the tests, \r\n2. improving the quality of research activities by increasing the quantity of data sets available to researchers through the acquisition of test data via ride-along test activities which add little or no additional cost, and \r\n3. increasing the overall knowledge base by improving communication among principal investigators and research partners while reducing the duplication of work. \r\n",
