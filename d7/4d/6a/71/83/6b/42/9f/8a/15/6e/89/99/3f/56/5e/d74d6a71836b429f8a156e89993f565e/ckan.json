  "notes": "Anthropogenic inputs of mercury (Hg) into the environment have significantly increased in the past few decades. In conjunction, the current availability of methylmercury in aquatic systems has increased to levels posing risks to human health and wildlife populations. Risk levels vary considerably in response to methylmercury availability, which is affected by lake hydrology, biochemistry, and may be associated with topography and proximity to airborne point sources. We selected the Common Loon as the most suitable bioindicator of aquatic Hg toxicity, based on ecological, logistical, and other criteria, including public valuations of natural resources. Non-random sampling efforts from 1994-98 indicate New England's breeding loon population is at unacceptable levels of risk to Hg contamination, particularly in Maine. Based on risk categories developed from the literature and in situ studies by BRI and their collaborators, 21-35% of the breeding loon population in Maine is estimated to be at risk, while 80% of the eggs laid exceed safe Hg levels and 38% are likely impacted. Because the evidence indicating loons were at serious risk from Hg was substantial, we identified several new organism and population parameters in order to increase confidence in our defined risk thresholds. Between 1994-98, we collected 78 abandoned eggs and blood and feather samples from 140 adult and 54 juvenile wild loons monitored and captured in Maine. In 1998, 60% of the total samples were collected and analyzed. The Hg concentrations of these samples were used to analyze potential subtle impacts of Hg on a number of parameters including effects on reproductive success, egg viability, behavior, developmental stability, immunosuppression, and individual survival. A total of 92 loon territories were monitored on 13 lakes in 1998, and behavioral studies were conducted on 33 loon territories. Overall productivity had a tendency to decline as adult blood Hg levels increased, thereby corroborating other studies that show Hg impacts. We estimated chronic Hg impacts on individual survival through the recapture of adults and found Maine loons have annual Hg increases of 10.6% and 7.5% for males and females respectively. Further studies building from this work will provide more definitive risk assessments that are based on Hg impact thresholds developed in Maine, and will help confirm if the effects we documented are persistent.",
