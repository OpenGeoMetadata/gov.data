    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;NASA is responsible for a number of facilities/structures with metallic structural and non-structural components in a highly corrosive environment.&amp;nbsp; Metals require periodic maintenance activity to guard against the insidious effects of corrosion and thus ensure that structures meet or exceed design or performance life. &amp;nbsp;The standard practice for protecting metallic substrates in atmospheric environments is the application of corrosion protective coating system. &amp;nbsp;These coating systems work via a variety of methods (barrier, galvanic and/or inhibitor) and adhere to the substrate through a combination of chemical and physical bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintenance at KSC is governed by NASA-STD-5008B (&lt;em&gt;Protective Coating of Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, and Aluminum on Launch Structures, Facilities, and Ground Support Equipment&lt;/em&gt;),&amp;nbsp;which establishes practices for the protective coating of launch facilities used by or for NASA programs and projects.&amp;nbsp; The Standard is also recommended guidance for all NASA Centers and is for the design of non-flight hardware used to support the operations of receiving, transportation, handling, assembly, inspection, test, checkout, service, and launch of space vehicles and payloads at NASA launch, landing, or retrieval sites. The criteria and practices contained within the Standard may be applied to items used at the manufacturing, development, and test sites upstream of the launch, landing, or retrieval sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA-STD-5008B includes an &amp;ldquo;Approved Products List&amp;rdquo; (APL) of coatings that have previously been tested and qualified for use.&amp;nbsp; The APL, however, includes coatings that have very high volatile organic compound VOC levels which are no longer compliant with current environmental regulations.&amp;nbsp; Some contain other hazardous constituents that are also subject to regulation.&amp;nbsp; The limited number of approved coatings in NASA-STD-5008B presents an obsolescence&amp;nbsp;risk to NASA if&amp;nbsp;materials should become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will identify and&amp;nbsp;qualify environmentally preferable coating alternatives to determine whether they provide adequate corrosion protection along with other properties&amp;nbsp;such as material compatibility and adhesion for use on NASA ground-based space infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study will continue through FY 2016 and will include testing for adhesion, compatibility, removability/reparability, and flexibility. Test team members continue to identify other coatings to include in the next round of testing.&lt;/p&gt;",
