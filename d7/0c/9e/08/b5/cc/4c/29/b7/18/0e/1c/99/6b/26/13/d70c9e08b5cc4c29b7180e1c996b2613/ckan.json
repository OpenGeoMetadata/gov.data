  "notes": "Our ongoing LCCMR-funded project has identified recruitment (herein defined as theprocess by which newly hatched fish survive to a year in age) as a key weakness inthe life history of the common carp, the most damaging invasive fish in manyMinnesota lakes. This project seeks to understand this weakness so that it might beeventually exploited to control carp. Of special interest is the possibility that winterkill(fish death caused by low oxygen levels attributable to heavy and prolongedsnow/ice cover) in interconnected shallow lakes and wetlands appears to correlatewith carp recruitment events, leading to the hypothesis that predatory gamefish(which are typically killed by such events, and unlike adult carp, are not highlymobile thus do not re-invade) might normally control carp recruitment. If true, thencarp recruitment might be reduced in certain lakes by controlling winter oxygenlevels in these lakes to prevent resident fish mortality (winterkills) and/or maintaininghigh densities of predatory fishes in carp nurseries (shallow marshes), and/orprevent movement of adult carp into winterkilled areas. This project tests thehypothesis that populations of predatory gamefish (ex. sunfish, crappies, walleye,etc.) normally control carp while attempting to develop new means to census andremove carp recruits, and lastly control their movement. It has six components.First, we conduct an in-lake experiment to test whether native gamefish at naturalabundances can control the survival of carp eggs, larvae and fry. Second, weconduct a fish survey in shallow lakes (half of which we expect to winterkill) to testthe hypothesis that the abundance of young-of-the-year carp (YOY) inverselycorrelates with game fish abundance and positively correlates with recent winterkill.The alternative hypothesis that food availability might also limit carp recruitmentduring many years is also examined. Third, we conduct an extensive study of theage-structure study of adult carp in several lakes to test the related hypothesis thatwinterkill events have historically triggered carp recruitment. Fourth, we test thehypothesis that food odors can be used to attract and trap young carp (less than twoyears in age) for census or removal. Fifth, we test the hypothesis that pheromonescan be used to attract and trap young carp for census or removal. Lastly, weconduct a pilot study to determine whether acoustic field can be safely andeffectively used to stop movement of young carp recruits between lakes andwetlands. Although relatively basic in nature, these studies will provide new, keyinformation needed to develop an integrated control program for this, Minnesotaâ€™smost damaging invasive fish species. If successful, the next step in this project willbe to examine ways to manage predatory gamefish and/or watershed ecology(winterkill) to minimize carp abundance.",
