  "notes": "In cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, the USGS developed a database of geomorphic data for a sampling of unregulated natural alluvial streams in Ohio. The vector point shapefile that these metadata describe is based on this geomorphic database and consists of 50 points and associated attributes. The database was developed as part of a study to develop methods to estimate bankfull characteristics of Ohio streams and to relate geomorphic characteristics of Ohio streams to peak streamflows of selected recurrence intervals. The results of the study are presented in a report by Sherwood and Huitger (2005). The database developed for this study consists of geomorphic, basin, and flood-frequency characteristics for 50 study sites in Ohio, of which 40 sites are near streamflow-gaging stations. Field surveys were done at each site to collect the geomorphic data. Bankfull indicators were identified and evaluated, cross-section and longitudinal profiles were surveyed, and bed- and bank-material were sampled. Field data were analyzed to determine various geomorphic characteristics such as bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull cross-sectional area, bankfull discharge, streambed slope, and bed- and bank-material particle-size distribution. The various geomorphic characteristics were analyzed by means of a combination of graphical and statistical techniques. These techniques resulted in a set of regional curves, simple-regression (drainage-area only) equations, and multiple-regression equations to estimate bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull cross-sectional area, and bankfull discharge. Explanatory variables included drainage area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median bed-material particle size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope. Average standard errors of prediction for bankfull width equations ranged from 20.6 to 24.8 percent; for bankfull mean depth, 18.8 to 20.6 percent; for bankfull cross-sectional area, 25.4 to 30.6 percent; and for bankfull discharge, 27.0 to 78.7 percent. The simple-regression (drainage-area only) equations have the highest average standard errors of prediction. The multiple-regression equations-in which the explanatory variables included drainage area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median bed-material particle size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope-have the lowest average standard errors of prediction. Statistical and graphical analyses were done to investigate development of methods to estimate flood-peak discharges from geomorphic characteristics based on the 40 study sites at streamflow-gaging stations. The logarithms of the annual peak discharges for each site were fit by a Pearson Type III frequency distribution to develop a flood-peak-frequency relation for each site. The peak-frequency data were related to geomorphic, basin, and climatic variables of the 40 study sites by multiple-regression analysis. The analyses resulted in a set of multiple-regression equations to estimate flood-peak discharge having recurrence intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years from bankfull cross-sectional area, in which the average standard errors of prediction are 31.6, 32.6, 35.9, 41.5, 46.2, and 51.2 percent, respectively.
