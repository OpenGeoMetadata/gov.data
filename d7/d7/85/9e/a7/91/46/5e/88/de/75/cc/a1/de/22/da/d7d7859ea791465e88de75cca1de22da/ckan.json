    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Global Landslide Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global landslide total \n\neconomic loss risks. A process of spatially allocating Gross Domestic Product (GDP) based upon the Sachs et al. (2003) methodology is \n\nutilized. First the proportional contributions of subnational units to their respective national GDP are determined using sources of \n\nvarious origins. The contribution rates are then applied to published World Bank Development Indicators to determine a GDP value for \n\nthe subnational unit. Once the national GDP has been spatially stratified into the smallest administrative units available, GDP \n\nvalues for grid cells are derived using Gridded Population of the World, Version 3 (GPWv3) data of population distributions. A per \n\ncapita contribution value is determined within each subnational unit, and this value is multiplied by the population per grid cell. \n\nOnce a GDP value has been determined on a per grid cell basis, then the regionally variable loss rate as derived from the historical \n\nrecords of EM-DAT is used to determine the total economic loss risks posed to a grid cell by landslide hazards. The final surface \n\ndoes not present absolute values of total economic loss, but rather a relative decile (1-10 with increasing risk) ranking of grid \n\ncells based upon the calculated economic loss risks. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center \n\nfor Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University \n\nCenter for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",
