  "notes": "The point locations of school programs are a result of an ongoing project to identify current school program locations where Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) programs are utilized. The FNS Office is in the Department of Education (formerly the Department of Children, Families and Learning or CFL). The Land Management Information Center created the data set using school building locations provided by the school districts and program locations from a CFL database. The records cover traditional K-12 programs, but if locations for alternative learning centers and other special programs were provided, LMIC added these locations also. Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and point in the data layer.",
