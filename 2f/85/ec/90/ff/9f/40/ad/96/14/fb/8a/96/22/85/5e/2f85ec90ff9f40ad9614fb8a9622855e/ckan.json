  "notes": "Before the Landsat commercialization contract was signed between the Department of Commerce and the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) on September 27, 1985, all Landsat activities were handled by the Federal government. After that date all Landsat commercial rights became the property of EOSAT. EOSAT will still retain exclusive sales rights to all Thematic Mapper (TM) data until July 1994, at which time all Landsat data over ten years old will become available from the National Archive at the EROS Data Center (EDC). The first satellite in the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) program was launched July 23, 1972 and designated ERTS 1. In 1975 the program was re-designated as the Landsat program to emphasize its primary area of interest, land resources. The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis. The complete Landsat system consists of an observation platform in a near-polar Earth orbit and ground installations to receive, process and distribute the data provided by the sensors carried on the satellite. The platform carries two remote sensor systems and a data relay system along with attitude-control and orbit-adjust subsystems, power supply, transmitters to send the data to ground receiving stations and receivers for ground station commands. The Landsat satellites are in a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit with a ground swath extending 185 km (115 miles) in both directions. Landsat 4 and 5 are inclined 98 degrees, have an orbital cycle of 16 days and an equatorial crossing of 9:45AM local time. The altitude of the satellites is 705 km (437 miles) for both Landsats 4 and 5. The Landsat platforms operate from a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days. Thematic Mapper (TM) data are received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network of 15 worldwide ground stations. Also, data are transmitted via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico and then relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the EOSAT data processing facility in Lanham, Maryland. TM data are processed for radiometric and geometric corrections at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).",
