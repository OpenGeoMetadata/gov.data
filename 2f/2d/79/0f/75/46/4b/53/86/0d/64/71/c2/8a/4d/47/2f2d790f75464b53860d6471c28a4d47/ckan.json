  "notes": "The piping plover (Charadrius melodus) and least tern (Sterna antillarum) are two native North American bird species that have traditionally used the beach of Parker River National Wildlife Refuge as breeding, resting and migration habitat. In the past two decades, the populations of both species have undergone serious declines. Currently the least tern is regarded as a National Species of Special Emphasis and, in December 1985, the Fish and Wildlife Service designated the piping plover as a threatened species in its Atlantic Coast range and endangered in its interior continental range. There is general agreement among field researchers that development of beachfront areas and disturbances and interference of breeding birds arising from human recreational  pursuits have been the principal causes in the decline of both species. There is also general concurrence that the foraging activities of red foxes (Vulpes fulva) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) can have very serious local impacts on the reproduction of both bird species. Indeed, the red fox is generally recognized as, by far, the most efficient predator of ground-nesting birds in  North America. Since the available data indicate that recreational activities by  refuge visitors and predation by foxes and skunks have had a significant negative effect on the reproductive success of least terns and piping plovers at Parker River Refuge in the past two decades and in view of the fact that recent aerial censuses indicate a marked increase in the Plum Island red fox population, a revision in the management procedures for these two bird species  is both appropriate and necessary at this time. By necessity, this change will involve a simultaneous revision in patterns of public use on a portion of the refuge beach and dune area during the breeding season.",
