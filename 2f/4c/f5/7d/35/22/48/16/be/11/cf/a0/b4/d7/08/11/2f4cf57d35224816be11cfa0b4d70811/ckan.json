  "notes": "The activity of the erythrocyte enzyme d-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) has long been used as a biomarker of lead exposure in humans and waterfowl and, more recently, in fishes. We tested the assay for ALA-D activity in fishes from streams affected by lead in combination with other metals from lead-zinc mining and related activities. Fishes (mostly catostomids) were collected from sites affected by historic and current mining activities, and from sites thought to be unaffected by mining (reference sites). A suite of elements was measured in blood and carcass samples of individual fish and in grab samples of water and sediment from each site. ALA-D activity, total protein (IP), and hemoglobin (Hb) content also were determined in blood. Concentrations of mining-related metals (lead, zinc, and cadmium) were significantly greater (P<O.O5) at sites affected by historic mining activities than at reference and active mining sites. ALA-D activity, Hb, and TP accounted for 66% of blood-lead and 69% of carcass-lead variability when analyzed by multiple regression. Differences among species were minimal. ALA-D activity as a biomarker was able to successfully distinguish sites affected by bioavailable environmental lead and appeared to be unaffected by other metals except for zinc, which tended to arneliorate the inactivation of ALA-D by lead. The utility of the biomarker lies in its expedience and its ability to document bioavailability.",
