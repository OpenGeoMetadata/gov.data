    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization (MDAO) tools today possess limited disciplines with little fidelity modeling capability.  These tools are typically developed as a single large software application that performs analysis for all disciplines but has little or no capability to integrate multi-fidelity and multi-discipline components that have already been developed as stand-alone analysis codes.  Even though a multitude of tools have been developed and well adapted to the interdisciplinary aircraft design/analysis, they have not been developed to work together.\r\nThe objective of the development of the MDAO tool is to generate a \"central executive\" that can integrate disparate software packages in a cross platform network environment so as to perform optimization and design tasks in a cohesive streamlined manner.  This object-oriented framework can integrate the analysis codes for multiple disciplines, instead of relying on one code to perform the analysis for all disciplines.\r\nZONA Technology and its team member Virginia Polytechnic Institute propose to develop three object-oriented components that will fully leverage tools currently under development within NASA's MDAO framework.  The three major components are:\r\n(1) an automatic re-meshing tool that can provide a fast and efficient mesh generation capability for complex structures like curved panels with curved stiffeners and aircraft wings of any shape with curved spars and ribs. \r\n(2) a hybrid optimization tool that combines a non-gradient based optimization method and a gradient based optimization method.  The advantage of this hybrid optimization is that a global optimum point can be achieved through the non-gradient optimization and acceleration of the convergence can be obtained by aiding gradient based optimization algorithm.\r\n(3) a fast transonic unsteady aerodynamics method for accurate aeroelastic analysis and shape sensitivity information due to the change of external wing shape.",
