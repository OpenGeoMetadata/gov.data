  "notes": " The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) complexat NASA Ames Research Center includes the 11-by 11-Foot Transonic and the 9-by 7-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnels, where researchers have tested generations of commercial and military aircraft and NASA space vehicles.   The UPWT has been instrumental in the development of virtually every domestic commercial transport and military fixed-wing airframe since the 1960&amp;#39;s and is one of the busiest wind tunnels in NASA. Researchers use the UPWT extensively for airframe testing and aerodynamic studies and the facility has played a vital role in every manned spaceflight program, including NASA&amp;#39;s Orion space capsule.   Ames is also home to a number of small-scale aerodynamics facilities and the National Full Scale Aerodynamics Complex, the world&amp;#39;s largest wind tunnel.  ",
