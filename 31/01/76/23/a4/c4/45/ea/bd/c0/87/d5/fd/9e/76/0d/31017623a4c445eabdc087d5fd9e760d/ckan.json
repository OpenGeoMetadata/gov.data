  "notes": "\r\nCongressional Districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives.  Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable.  The 114th Congress is seated from January 2015 to 2017. The cartographic boundary files for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas.  The boundaries of all other congressional districts are provided to the Census Bureau through the Redistricting Data Program (RDP).",
