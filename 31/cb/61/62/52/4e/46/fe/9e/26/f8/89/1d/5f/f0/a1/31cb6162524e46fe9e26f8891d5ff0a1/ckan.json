    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Since the majority of the potential ADR targets are large (&amp;gt;meters) upper stages and payloads between 800 and 1100 km altitude, they are relatively bright, with visual magnitudes ranging from 5 to 7. Small telescopes are sufficient to collect their light curve data. However, due to the potential high tumble motion of the targets, a CCD camera with a frame rate up to 30/sec is needed. Identify an existing group with the necessary facility, equipment, experience, and capability for light curve observations of potential ADR targets in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region. Collect light curve data of at least 100 major ADR targets, including SL-8 Cosmos 3M second stages (2.4 m diameter by 6 m length; 1400 kg dry mass) and SL-16 Zenit second stages (4 m diameter by 12 m length; 8900 kg dry mass). Process raw data, obtain light curves, and analyze the data. Outcomes: A 4-month contract with the Air Force Academy was established in 2011. The Air Force Academy used one of their 16&amp;rdquo; telescopes equipped with a fast Andor CCD camera for the observations. A total of 126 targets were observed during the 4-month period (ended in February 2012). About half of the targets had multiple passes. All raw data were processed, and summary spreadsheets for individual targets were prepared and delivered by the Air Force Academy. Two abstracts on the observations and the implications for the tumble motions of the ADR targets for the 2012 International Astronautical Congress were submitted and accepted for presentation.&lt;/p&gt;",
