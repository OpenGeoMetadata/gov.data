    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The reprocessed Version-3 Aura OMI Level-2G Cloud data product OMCLDRRG has been made available (in April 2012) to the public from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).(http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldrrg_v003.shtml\n\n      Aura OMI provides two Level-2G Cloud products (OMCLDRRG and\n      OMCLDO2G)that are based on two different algorithms, the Rotational\n      Raman Scattering method and the O2-O2 absorption method. This level-2G\n      global cloud product (OMCLDRRG) provides effective cloud pressure and\n      effective cloud fraction that is based on the least square fitting of\n      the Ring spectrum (filling-in of Fraunhofer lines in the range 392 to\n      398 nm due to rotational Raman scattering).  This product also\n      contains many ancillary and derived parameters, terrain and\n      geolocation information, solar and satellite viewing angles, and\n      quality flags.\n      \n      (The shortname for this Level-2G OMI Cloud Pressure and Fraction product is OMCLDRRG)\n\t    The algorithm lead for the products OMCLDRR and OMCLDRRG is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joinner(Joanna.Joiner.1 at nasa.gov ).\n      \n      OMCLDRRG data product is a special Level-2G Gridded Global Product\n      where pixel level data (OMCLDRR)are binned into 0.25x0.25 degree\n      global grids. It contains the OMCLDRR data for all L2 scenes that\n      have observation time betweeen UTC times of 00:00:00 and\n      23:59:59.9999. All data pixels that fall in a grid box are saved\n      Without Averaging. Scientist can apply data filtering scheme of\n      their choice and create new gridded products.\n      \n      OMCLDRRG data products are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format\n      (HDF-EOS5).  Each daily file contains data from the day lit portion of\n      the orbits (~14 orbits).  The average file size for the OMCLDRRG data\n      product is about 75 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and\n      extracting data from these files can be found at:\n      http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml. The GES DISC developed\n      interactive tool Giovanni ( http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) provides\n      on-line web based capabilities to browse and explore Aura data.\n      \n      A README document containing brief algorithm description and known\n      data quality related issues and file spec are provided by the OMCLDRR\n      and OMCLDRRG Algorithm lead (see\n      http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldrrg_v003.shtml ).\n      \n      Data Category Parameters:\n         \n      The OMCLDRRG data file consists of a Grid Data Object which contains\n      complete information of each pixel binned into the grid.\n          \n      Cloud Parameters (and Precision): Two Effective Cloud Fraction and\n      Cloud Pressure (based on two different clear and cloudy scene\n      reflectivity criteria), Cloud Mask\n          \n        Ancillary Data:\n           Terrain Pressure, Terrain Height, Reflectivity,\n           Chlorophyll Amount, Effective Reflectivity (394.1 micron),\n           UV Aerosol Index (based on 360 and 388 nm),\n           and many other Algorithm Parameters \n             \n        Quality Flags:\n            Ground Pixel QualityFlags, \n            Measurement QualityFlags, \n            Processing Quality Flags\n      \n         Time and Geolocation Data:\n            Time,  Latitude, Longitude, Solar Zenith Angle, Viewing Zenith Angle,  \n            Relative Azimuth Angle, Line Number, Scene Number, \n            Number Of Candidate Scenes, Path Length, Orbit Number",
