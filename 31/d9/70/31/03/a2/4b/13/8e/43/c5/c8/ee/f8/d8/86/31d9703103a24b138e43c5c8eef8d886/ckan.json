  "notes": "This GIS shapefile data illustrates the regional, subregional, and local transit corridors included in the Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan community growth option of compact and dispersed development (Option C). This network accommodates a land use pattern focused on fixed transit corridors linking regional and subregional centers. The routes are based on data from the Louisiana State Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Statewide Transportation Plan. Projects include components from the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and local Metropolitan Planning Organization Master Transportation Plans (MTP) while relying heavily on Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan workshops. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
