Nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates in this coverage are reported for each county polygon in tons of actual nutrient sold (inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and potash) as distinct from total tons of fertilizer product. The data are summarized for fertilizer years (i.e. the 1987 fertilizer year runs from July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987). The polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States, as well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) file representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States (1970).

In some counties no fertilizer sales were reported, but some fertilize use was reported in the Census Data. Although fertilizer expenditures estimates (in $1,000) represent the 1987 growing year, the nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates (tons) generally reflect 1990 amounts. Estimates of nitrogen-fertilizer sales by county were constructed from a combination of data reported to State regulatory agencies and from data in the 1987 Census of Agriculture. Fertilizer-sales data submitted annually to State regulatory agencies by fertilizer dealers reflect total sales without regard to the land use for which it was bought, or the State (or county) in which the fertilizer was actually used. In the Census of Agriculture sampling and statistics were used to account for nonresponding farm operations (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989b). Thus, the information that describes county-level fertilizer sales is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage errors. Census disclosure rules also prevent the publication of information that would reveal the operation of individual farms. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching. Polygons that extend into the water (an ocean or the Great Lakes) should be considered arbitrary.\", \"Access Constraints: (describe any restrictions or legal prerequisites for accessing the data set.
