  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 30x30 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 2006. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the College of Charleston, as well as the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster , and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Charleston Bump from 08/28/2006 to 08/29/2006. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by the College of Charleston Department of Geology using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option \"BASE Surface to Image\" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas.",
