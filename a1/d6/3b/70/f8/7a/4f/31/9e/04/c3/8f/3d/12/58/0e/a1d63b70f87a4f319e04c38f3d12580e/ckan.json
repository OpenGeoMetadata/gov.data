    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The UARS Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) level 2 Atmosphere X-Ray Imaging Spectrometer (AXIS) unit 2 daily product contains the X-ray high-resolution spectral data converted to number intensity units from the AXIS2 pixels mounted on the UARS body. PEM was flown on the UARS spacecraft to measure the type, amount, energy, and distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.\n                        \nThe PEM AXIS2 X-ray data cover roughly the energy range from 2 keV to 300 keV.  There are eight AXIS2 pixels mounted in the AXIS2 housing, each viewing different directions.  The AXIS2 pixels are aligned on the spacecraft to project about 45 deg toward the +x axis direction from the Earthward pointing direction (+z axis).  Each pixel of AXIS2 is staggered about the 45 degree direction in an every-other fashion.  Pixel 1 is closest to the center line of the spacecraft and Pixel 8 is furtherest away; however, their ground projection is dependent on the spacecraft orientation.\n\nThere is one data file per day for the PEM AXIS2 product, and the temporal coverage is from Oct. 1, 1991 to Aug. 23, 2005. Spatial coverage for the AXIS2 product ranges between -80 and +80 deg latitude.  The AXIS2 data files are written in network binary format. For more information please review the PEM AXIS2 data format guide.",
