  "notes": " Full-scale study in controlled conditions The Frost Effects Research Facility (FERF) is the largest refrigerated warehouse in the United States that can be used for a variety of roadway and pavement, geotechnical and other investigations at sub-freezing temperatures year-round. Tests can be conducted using a combination of ambient and ground temperatures from approximately 20 &amp;#176;F to 80(+) &amp;#176;F year-round, with the ability to conduct accelerated pavements testing and evaluation due to the effects of repeated freezing and thawing. On-hand equipment to support non-destructive pavements investigations includes a 20-ton crane on a monorail, a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and a heavy weight deflectometer (HWD), a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) to rapidly replicate a large number of passes by typical highway traffic loads, and other equipment. In addition to controlling temperatures, testing can incorporate controlled moisture conditions and use a variety of specific sub-grade materials. As an example of the FERF&amp;#39;s flexibility to accommodate a wide range of RDT&amp;amp;E investigations, the facility will soon house a 50-ft wave tank in the Southeast quadrant to study sea-ice interactions with waves and petroleum products, with wider temperature ranges and other additional testing additional capabilities. Unique research&amp;#160;and testing facility Previous studies include American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO)&amp;#160;subgrade study, U.S. Air Force Airfield Damage Repair at sub-freezing temperatures using novel concrete and flowable fill materials, University of Alaska Pile Creep Study, Montana State University pavement geo-reinforcement study, and evaluation of mine detector and ground penetrating radar capabilities and limitations for Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD).
