    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides estimates of watershed deforestation, as a proportion of the total area of watersheds, in Rondonia, Brazil for 1999. Deforestation maps were determined for the main agricultural and surrounding forested areas of Rondonia using multiple Landsat TM scenes (Biggs et al. 2008). Cumulative deforestation estimates were derived from this time series of Landsat scenes from 1975 to 1999. To obtain watershed-level estimates of deforestation, watershed boundaries and stream networks were delineated by a flow accumulation algorithm using a 90-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results were watersheds of seven Strahler stream orders (1-7) with stream networks that closely matched those of the 1:100,000 topographic maps for the area. The watershed boundaries, classified by stream order, were overlain on the time series of deforestation maps to determine the cumulative deforestation extent in 1999. This data set contains six ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles of the watershed boundaries for streams orders 2-7, the smallest watershed (second order) to the largest inclusive watershed (seventh order). The cumulative deforestation estimates, as a proportion of total area for each watershed, are available as a comma-delimited text file that can be related to the individual watershed boundary shapefiles. Cumulative deforestation data are available for first order streams, although not as a shapefile. There are six zipped ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles (*.zip) and one ASCII comma separated file with this data set.",
