    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Wide bandgap SiC power devices have the potential for reliable operations at higher junction temperatures, higher voltages, higher frequencies and thus higher power densities than what can be achieved with Si devices. These advantages enable the SiC technology-based power conversion systems (PCM) to be made smaller, lightweight, more efficient and robust. Recent studies predicted that the volume of a power converter system could be reduced five times through the utilization of SiC power devices.   Despite this potential promise and encouraging results, more studies are needed to address the design and fabrication of SiC-based PCMs before their full potential can be realized. This project will develop an ultrahigh-efficiency, light and compact power converter system based on emerging SiC semiconductor technologies, quantifying the system benefits and addressing the related technical issues. The Phase I work include: (1) Circuit design of an SiC-based converter and modeling to evaluate the converter performance (power loss, efficiency, temperature rise, and weight/size heatsink etc.), and (2) High temperature packaging and high power density thermal management to support the SiC converter.
