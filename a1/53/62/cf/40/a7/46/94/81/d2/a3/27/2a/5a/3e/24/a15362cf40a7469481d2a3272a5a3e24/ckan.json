    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;We propose an innovative approach to overcome the infrared signal detection difficulties.&amp;nbsp; In this investigation, a Periodical Poled MgO Lithium Niobate (PPMgOLN) based frequency up-conversion devices will be developed to efficiently convert the infrared signals into visible/near-infrared signals which can be sensitively detected by well-developed superior silicon avalanche photodiodes (Si-APD). This innovative device will allow detect infrared signals with high sensitivity, high dynamic range, fast response, and low noise background.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The principle of up-conversion device is based on non-linear interaction btween two optical beams.&amp;nbsp; When a strong pump beam&amp;nbsp; and a weak probe beam interact in a suitable nonlinear crystal, a signal at third frequency is generated under the condition of energy and momentum conservation. For example, interaction between a pump beam at 1.06&amp;micro;m and weak infrared 2.05&amp;micro;m beam in the PPMgOLN crystal can generate photons at 0.7&amp;micro;m wavelength. The number of probe photons is much smaller than that pump photons because the probe beam is usually very weak. Only a small portion of pump photons have the chance to mix with probe photons to generate photons at sum frequency of the pump and probe beam. Therefore, the circulating power in the crystal is constant because of the negligible pump depletion. In theory, every infrared probe photons can be converted into visible/near infrared photons&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An intra-cavity pumped up-conversion device is designed to demonstrate the frequency up conversion capbility. One periodically poled PPMgOLN is used in this study.&amp;nbsp; A CW 808 nm diode laser is used to pump a Nd:YAG rod inside the cavity to generate the 1064 nm pump beam. The leakage of 1064 nm light is used to monitor the circulating intra-cavity pump power. A two-micron DFB laser was also aligned through the PPMgOLN to simulate the weak probe beam.&amp;nbsp; CaF2 dispersion prisms and laser line filters were used to separate the generated 700 nm photons from the photons at other wavelengths for accurate visible signal measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The up-converted photons can be measured with Silicon Single Photon Avalanche Photodiode detector to take advantages of its high quantum efficiency and low dark current. Thus, extremely weak infrared signal can be measured with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
