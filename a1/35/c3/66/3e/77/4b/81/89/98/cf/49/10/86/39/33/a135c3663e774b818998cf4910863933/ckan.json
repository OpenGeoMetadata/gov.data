    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop high speed magnetostrictive and MEMS actuators for rapidly deflecting or deforming mirrors.  High speed, light-weight, low voltage beam deflectors are required for rapid tuning of lasers, airborne and ground based lidar transmitters and receivers, image correctors, scanners, printers, target acquisition and countermeasures.   Technologies currently employed include, electro-mechanical actuators: piezo, galvanometric, voice-coil, etc, electro or acousto-optical devices.  They suffer from some or all of following drawbacks: low speed, high voltage requirement, limited life, hysteresis, high cost and bulky connections. Recent advances in magentostrictive materials have shown that large displacements (&gt;100mm) at high frequencies (~ 40kHz) can be achieved.  Using this novel technology we will build innovative mirror systems for achieving high speed beam deflections (tens of mrad). Key attributes of these deflectors are: low voltage excitation, non-contact energy transfer, compact and rugged systems for applications in lasers, lidars and airborne systems. In Phase I after exploring optimum configurations and designs of deflectors, we will fabricate laboratory scale actuators and mirrors.  The speed and deflection performance of the devices will be measured and establish their feasibility.  In Phase II we will build two prototype beam deflectors and incorporate them into tunable laser and lidar receiver systems for testing.",
