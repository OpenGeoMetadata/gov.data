  "notes": " FUNCTION: Develops and evaluates the effectiveness of high-power microwave waveforms for the disruption of electronic systems. Included in the facility are an anechoic chamber, Lexan blast chamber, nearfield focusing dish antenna, and associated RF sources and instruments. High power RF frequencies between 0.6 and 40 GHz may be used inside the anechoic chamber. RF interactions with explosives can be explored using the Lexan blast chamber inside the anechoic facility. DESCRIPTION: The facility is used to explore explosively generated RF systems and the interactions of RF on explosive materials. A storage locker in the facility is cleared to store explosives in small amounts and the blast chamber is rated for up to 0.01lbs of explosive or three blasting caps. Explosives may be characterized using various instruments before and after being exposed to RF. The nearfield focusing antenna allows for high intensity RF fields directed into a spot. This allows component-specific exposure to RF of complex systems. The anechoic chamber is 24 ft wide x 30 ft long x 50 ft high. INSTRUMENTATION: The facility contains sources, RF measurement equipment, and data acquisition instrumentation. Available RF sources include high-power traveling wave tubes (TWTs), solid state devices and magnetrons to provide both continuous and short-pulse high-power RF. Antennas covering multiple frequency ranges are also available. Survey meters are available for measuring RF inside and outside the chamber along with a variety of power meters and associated probes. High-speed scopes and spectrum analyzers are also available for the measurement and analysis of waveforms. A network analyzer may also be used to carry out circuit measurements.  ",
