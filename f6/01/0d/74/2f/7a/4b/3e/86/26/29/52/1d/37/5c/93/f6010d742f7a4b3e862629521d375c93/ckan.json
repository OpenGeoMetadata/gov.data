  "notes": "This theme shows the boundaries of those areas of Minnesota that have been legislatively designated as State Forests(http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/index.html). Minnesota?s 58 state forests were established to produce timber and other forest crops, provide outdoor recreation, protect watersheds, and perpetuate rare and distinctive species of native flora and fauna. The mapped boundaries are based on legislative/statutory language and are described in broad terms based on legal descriptions. Private or other ownerships included inside a State Forest boundary are typically NOT identified in legislative language and subsequently are NOT mapped in this layer. It is important to note that these data do not represent public ownership. State Forest boundaries often include private land and should not be used to determine ownership. Ownership information can be found in the State Lands by Administrator â€“ Forestry(http://jmaps.dnr.state.mn.us/mdreporter/dp_brief_record.jsp?mpid=24000005&ptid=02&fcid=01) layer and the GAP Stewardship 2008(http://jmaps.dnr.state.mn.us/mdreporter/dp_brief_record.jsp?mpid=39000586&ptid=02&fcid=01) layer. Data has been updated during 2009 by the DNR Forest Resource Assessment office.",
