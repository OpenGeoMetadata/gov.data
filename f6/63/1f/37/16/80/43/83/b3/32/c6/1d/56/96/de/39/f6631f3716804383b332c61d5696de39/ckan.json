    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The overall objective of this project is to develop a drag and drop,\ncomponent library (fluidic lego) based, system simulation and\noptimization software for entire lab-on-chip systems.  Current\napproaches for biochip system design are either very inefficient\n(trial-and-error based) or time-consuming (high-fidelity\nsimulation-based).  The proposed tool will benefit the biochip community\nby tremendously shortening design optimization times (minutes).\nRepresentation of complex, interacting physico-chemical processes of a\nbiochip in a system design tool is a formidable challenge.  Our\ninnovative solution seeks to use state-of-the-art high-fidelity\nsimulations to develop and train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based\nmodels for different components of a biochip.  The Phase I effort will\nfocus on proof-of-concept by (a) Development of multiphysics\nsimulation-based ANN models for typical components of a biochip; (b)\nDemonstration of capabilities of the developed ANN model through\noptimization of a micromixing biochip.  In Phase II, we will further\ndevelop and refine ANN models to account for additional multiphysics\neffects (electrokinetics, biochemistry, etc.) and dynamic response.  The\nfinal product will feature a comprehensive library of components along\nwith a user-friendly graphical user interface.  CFDRC is the technology\nleader in multiphysics simulations for the biochip industry, and very\nwell placed to successfully undertake this challenging task.",
