  "notes": "  Background:  The Naval Automated Information Laboratory (NAIL), consisting of Navy legacy and transitional systems, was established to emulate a typical command for the purpose of evaluating the performance of existing configurations. The NAIL has since evolved into the Information Systems Technology Laboratory (ISTL) so that JITC representatives may perform analysis of specific Defense Message System (DMS) user and infrastructure-level components and determine the ability of these components to function within defined transitional and target configurations. Within the ISTL, functional DMS capabilities are analyzed against required Department of Defense (DOD) elements-of-service (EOS). In addition, connectivity to the Technology Insertion Environment (TIE), at Ft. Detrick, Maryland, has been established to validate unique Department of the Navy (DON) DMS messaging strategies.  Purpose:  The ISTL located in the test facility at Indian Head, Maryland, provides an avenue for DMS network prototypes and commercial products to be examined and demonstrated by an independent test facility. This will allow the Navy to explore opportunities for the integration of new technology in both shore based and tactical environments. The ISTL is able to emulate all Navy DMS shore and all Navy tactical suite interface configurations used within the existing Naval communications architecture. The ISTL has recently been used during Navy interoperability testing of the Defense Message Dissemination System (DMDS) Version 6.2 and the Tactical Message Gateway (TMG) with Attachment Manager. The ISTL also provides an environment for the conduct of mock Functional System Checkout (FSCO), Test &amp;amp; Acceptance (T&amp;amp;A), and Training efforts as well as the validation of DON DMS Recommended Standard Operating Procedures (RSOPs) that were developed to assist Navy DMS Area/Local Control Centers (ACCs/LCCs) in everyday operations. In addition, ISTL connectivity to the Ft. Detrick TIE infrastructure will allow JITC to perform collaborative testing with other Navy development laboratories such as the DMS labs at SSC Charleston, South Carolina and SSC San Diego, California. Collaborative testing of Navy DMS Dial-in strategies, Mail List (ML) transition and usage, and Navy DMS Tactical concepts will provide both DISA and the Navy with valuable lessons learned for future field implementations.
