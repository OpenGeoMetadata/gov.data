    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is one comma-separated (.csv) data file and one text (.txt) file (bibliographic information) with this data set. This data set provides above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and total net primary producitivity (NPP) [expressed in grams of carbon per square meter per year (gC/m2/year)], and the C fraction used to convert dry biomass weight to carbon content, for 127 unique study sites in northern Eurasia. The sites are classified by ecozone (i.e., tundra, forest-tundra, taiga, mixed forest, broadleaf forest, small-leaved secondary forests, forest bogs, meadows, steppe, semi-desert, and polar desert) and plant community (phytocoenosis). Each study location is georeferenced (latitude/longitude) with elevation and zonal/interzonal information. References to original author, year of publication, and table/record in Bazilevich (1993) are also included. The data set also provides a bibliography of 274 original-source references (in Russian) to accompany the 127 data records on NPP from Bazilevich (1993). The data are a subset of data adapted from Bazilevich, N.I. 1993. Biological Productivity of Ecosystems of Northern Eurasia. Nauka Publishers, Moscow. 293 pp. (in Russian). The data set originated from field measurements of primary productivity collected between 1940 and 1988 for most of the terrestrial vegetation types in northern Eurasia.  The NPP data collection contains field measurements of biomass, estimated NPP, and climate data for terrestrial grassland, tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, and tundra sites worldwide. Data were compiled from the published literature for intensively studied and well-documented individual field sites and from a number of previously compiled multi-site, multi-biome data sets of georeferenced NPP estimates. The principal compilation effort (Olson et al., 2001) was sponsored by the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program. For more information, please visit the NPP web site at http://daac.ornl.gov/NPP/npp_home.html.",
