    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR effort is focused on developing a Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) concept where-in ARTCCs can benefit from re-configuring airspaces based on Traffic Flow Management (TFM) restrictions, and the development of a preliminary Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES)-framework and initial algorithms to demonstrate that ARTCCs need to engage in a coordination framework of exchanging TFM restriction until they determine mutually-agreeable optimal airspace configuration. The development of algorithms that leverage and recognize the interactions and interdependencies between DAC and TFM is the key innovation of this effort. Some examples of expected operational improvements include 1) reduction in congestion and delays when sector capacities (Monitoring Alert Parameter or Dynamic Density) are violated, 2) reduction in controller workload and improved safety, 3) ability to accommodate user preferred routes and weather uncertainty and 4) achieve a balance between airborne delay and grounding holding delay. The SBIR Phase-I effort demonstrated how a combined DAC-TFM algorithm determines an optimal airspace configuration different from a DAC-only algorithm and could result in minimization of peak count and dwell time variance. The effort also included the design and preliminary implementation of a TFM model that uses ARTCC sector configuration to determine the delays that is generated, absorbed and propagated. The Phase II effort includes development of DAC-TFM framework as an enhancement to NASA's ACES- DADS (Dynamic Airspace Design Service) work and interaction of NASA's airspace partitioning DAC algorithms such as MxDAC, DAU slicing and Sector Combination algorithms with the TFM models using the same framework.",
