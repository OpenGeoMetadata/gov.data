  "notes": "The potential for contaminant problems has existed for decades, and will likely increase in the future. Womens Bay has been and continues to be affected by industrial development, military facilities, spills of organic materials and non-point source activities. Numerous seafood processors operate along St. Paul Harbor and Near Island Channel. Eight processors received National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits in 1986: they may collectively discharge 5,888,000 gallons of wastewater daily. Two additional facilities, Kodiak Reduction Inc. and Cook Inlet Processing, Inc. have recently been renovated and are expected to commence operations soon in/near Gibson Cove. Prior to renovation the former facility operated without a valid NPDES permit for nearly ten years. Pollution of Gibson Cove was sufficiently controversial to require intervention by the State of Alaska Ombudsman's office. The Naval Base on Nyman Peninsula was converted to a Coast Guard Facility in the 1940s; it is the largest Coast Guard Base in Alaska and occupies virtually the entire peninsula. Numerous documented hydrocarbon spills and leaks have occurred at and near the facility in the last decade. Following a detailed inspection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandated that many storage tanks and infrastructures be replaced. The U.S. Geological Survey simultaneously investigated potential ground water contamination from improperly stored/disposed materials. Womens Bay is the site of a military dumping ground that was presumably utilized during and after World War II. The Service presently has no information concerning the period of use, nor the amounts and types of materials disposed in these waters. An active Coast Guard landfill and abandoned U.S. Navy landfill produce leachates which eventually enter the Buskin River. The Buskin River, in turn, empties into Refuge waters. A Coast Guard (contracted) study stated that previous asbestos disposal was no longer a problem, but that turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand, and phenol were noticeably elevated (EMPS Engineering, 1984). The report recommended remedial measures for both the Navy and Coast Guard landfills to reduce leachate input to the Buskin River. Sporadic grab samples taken by federal and state agencies have indicated elevated levels of contaminants at specific sites and specific points in time. However, data have not allowed general conclusions about overall quality of Refuge waters and their ability to support fish and wildlife resources. Future development plans within Womens Bay include expansion of the Coast Guard facility, expansion of dock facilities for a freight transfer company, construction of dry-dock boat repair facilities, and expanded operation of seafood processing facilities. Existing and future developments have the potential to pose significant cumulative impacts to the fish and wildlife resources of the area. (Some of the potential contaminant inputs are mapped and described in Figure 3 and Table 1.) This study was undertaken to assess the present levels of contaminants identifiable in Womens Bay.",
