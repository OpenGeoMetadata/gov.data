    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The CubeSat platform represents a valuable architecture from which to develop satellite capabilities, payloads and technologies.  However, CubeSat spacecraft must be able to support a variety of payload options and mission profiles while providing high reliability.  A highly efficient CubeSat Electrical Power System (EPS) is critical to enabling these mission and payload requirements.  When compared against existing products, an Innoflight CubeSat Power Management Controller (CPMC) with associated CubeSat Solar Array Articulation System (CSAAS) provides game changing performance, flexibility, and reliability.  The proposed CubeSat CPMC / CSAAS solution provides 20 watts of on-orbit average power, accommodates various battery chemistries, supports ultra-capacitor technologies for high peak power payload, and is provided in a fully redundant configuration.  At the conclusion of Phase 1, Innoflight will demonstrate the operation of a prototype CPMC / CSAAS system for a representative CubeSat mission, bringing the system to a TRL of 5.  During Phase 2, Innoflight will complete functional and environmental qualification, bringing the system to a TRL of 8.  Following the completion of Phase 2, two sets of CPMC / CSAAS flight hardware will be fabricated and tested, and the system will be ready for flight demonstration on a CubeSat platform.\r\n\r\n",
