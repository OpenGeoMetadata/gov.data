    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The project focuses on key physico-chemical process technologies for Atmosphere Revitalization Systems (ARS) that increase reliability, capability, and consumable mass recovery as well as reduce requirements for power, volume, heat rejection, and crew involvement. For the Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) effort, the project is developing and demonstrating onboard analysis capabilities which will replace the documented need to return air and water samples to earth for ground analysis. This effort is addressing these challenges by adopting a new architecture that is based on the modular integration of multiple sensing modalities, employing a hybrid combination of simple, rugged technologies and, where needed, highly capable complex approaches, to completely address monitoring needs of the future. It incorporates Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technologies to enable significant miniaturization over current systems, and selects elements offering both low resources and high reliability operation for affordability. The project is developing, demonstrating and/or testing leading process technology candidates and system architectures that will meet or exceed current requirements and fill capability gaps or significantly improve the efficiency, safety, and reliability over the State-of-Art (SOA). The project&amp;rsquo;s main goal is to demonstrate test articles (at various technology readiness&amp;nbsp;levels) in a ground test facility under relevant flight conditions.&lt;/p&gt;",
