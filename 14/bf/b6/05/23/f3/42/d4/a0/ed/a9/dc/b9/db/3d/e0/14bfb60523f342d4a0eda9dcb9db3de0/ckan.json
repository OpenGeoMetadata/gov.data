The consortium was awarded the NEXTOR II contract in 2011, and builds upon the success of the original NEXTOR consortium, which operated under the FAA&amp;#39;s Centers of Excellence program from 1996-2006. The consortium is entering its 20th year as a Center of Excellence, with no truncation of service.   Our strategic goal is to lead the aviation community by advancing new ideas and paradigms for aviation operations, educating and training aviation professionals, and promoting knowledge transfer among industry, government and academic leaders.   Core members include:  George Mason University Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of California at Berkeley University of Maryland at College Park Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Georgia Institute of Technology Purdue University The Ohio State University  ",
