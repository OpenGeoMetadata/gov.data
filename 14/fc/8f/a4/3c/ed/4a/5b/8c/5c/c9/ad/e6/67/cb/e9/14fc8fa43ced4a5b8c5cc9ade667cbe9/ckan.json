    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides modeled carbon flux estimates at 8-km spatial resolution over North America for the year 2004 of (1) net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2), (2) net ecosystem production (NEP, the balance of net primary production and heterotrophic respiration), (3) stream evasion (CO2 emitted from streams and rivers), (4) emissions from harvested forest and agricultural products, and (5) emissions from biomass burning.Annual estimates, in g C/m2/year, are provided for all five fluxes. Daily estimates, in g C/m2/day, are provided for NEP and stream evasion fluxes. Fluxes for fire emissions, harvest decomposition/respiration, stream evasion, and NEP were derived as described in Section 5.NEE fluxes were estimated using a full bottom-up accounting of NEE produced by integrating emissions from harvested forest and agricultural products, CO2 emitted from streams and rivers, and biomass burning in the CarbonTracker (version 2011_oi) modeling system. NEE estimates were run in the forward mode through the CarbonTracker inversion setup that calculates CO2 uptake and release at the Earth's surface over time. Refer to Turner et al.(2013) for details.There are seven data files in NetCDF (.nc) format with this data set, including: five annual files for fire emissions, harvest decomposition/respiration, stream evasion, NEP, and NEE fluxes; and two daily files for NEP and stream evasion fluxes.",
