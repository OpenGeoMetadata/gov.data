  "notes": "The VTBB201006 VT Broadband Availability Dataset represents wireline and wireless ''broadband service'' availability in VT as of 6/30/2010. This dataset was compiled in support of BroadbandVT.org and the NTIA State Broadband Data and Development (SBDD) grant program. This dataset includes the following feature classes - Utility_VTBB201006_point_Public = The list provided contains non-commercial locations where free broadband access is available. It primarily lists public libraries. - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_BlockAll = Detailed broadband availability by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_BlockSum = Total availability of wireline and wireless broadband service by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_Cable = Availablity of cable broadband by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_DSL = Availablity of DSL broadband by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_Fiber = Availablity of fiber optic broadband by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_Wireless = Availablity of wireless (mobile and fixed) broadband by census block - Utility_VTBB201006_poly_Wireline = Availablity of wireline (cable, DSL, fiber optic) broadband by census block For this purpose, ''broadband service'' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an ''end user'' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not ''end users'' for this purpose. An entity is a ''facilities based'' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, ''broadband service'' is ''available'' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.",
