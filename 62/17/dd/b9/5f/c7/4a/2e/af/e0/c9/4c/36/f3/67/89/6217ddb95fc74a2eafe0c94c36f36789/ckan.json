    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set includes measurements of standard geochemical variables, dissolved CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC), and coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOC) in samples taken from 60 Amazonian river locations across the Amazon Basin from 1991 to 2003 (Mayorga et al., 2005). The 14C and 13C isotopic composition of DIC was measured on samples collected between 1991 and 2003. The 14C composition of organic carbon fractions was measured on samples collected from 1995 through 1996. There are four comma-delimited data files with this data set. Note that site descriptions include a categorization of each site by topography according to the percentage of the drainage area above 1,000 m elevation (Mayorga et al., 2005). Only means of geochemical and carbon-fraction results are provided. Both individual 13C and 14C measurements and mean results are provided. ",
