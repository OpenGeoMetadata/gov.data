  "notes": "Sediment, water, bird tissues, and potential bird food items (plants, invertebrates, and fish) were sampled at 15 eastern New Mexico playas that receive secondary treated wastewater effluent. In addition to standard measures of water and sediment quality, metals (metals, trace-metals, and metalloids), radium, organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, and arochlor-PCB concentrations were determined. Analytical results were compared to data available in the literature. Concentrations of most contaminants analyzed for were less than water and sediment quality criteria, typical background concentrations, and avian dietary thresholds of adverse effects. However, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were elevated in ducklings and killdeer eggs at the Cannon AFB Playa, at concentrations that may be toxic to the eggs. Also, at all three sites where ducks were sampled (Cannon AFB, Clovis WWTP, and Ladd Gordon playas) copper was elevated to potentially toxic concentrations in their livers, and lead was elevated in a duck ovum at Cannon AFB and ducklings at the Ladd Gordon playa. Based on the results of this study, trace metal contamination, particularly copper, at playas receiving treated sewage effluent should be examined more thoroughly. Although some sediment and aquatic organism metal concentrations exceeded avian dietary thresholds and/or sediment quality criteria, none were concurrently elevated in bird tissues. Many of these elevated metals likely reflect geologic sources in this region. Region-specific criteria for water, sediment, and tissue metals concentrations would be helpful to better understand metal toxicity risks to birds and aquatic organisms in the Southwest.",
