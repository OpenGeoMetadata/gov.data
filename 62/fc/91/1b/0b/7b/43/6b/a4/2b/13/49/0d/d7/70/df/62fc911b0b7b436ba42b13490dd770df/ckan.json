  "notes": "Nesting behavior, productivity, and physical condition of starlings were evaluated between reference and PCB remediated sites. Nest box usage was similar among all sites, with the exception of the AP reference site where habitat conditions were not favorable for nesting. Adult starling nest attentiveness (provisioning rate) was similar among sites. Egg hatch rates and fledging success also were similar among reference and remediated sites. Weight of 3- and 9day-old chicks did not differ among sites, although they did differ between years. Fifteen-day weights for male starling chicks also were similar among sites; however, they did differ between years. Contrarily, female 1 5-day weights did differ among sites, but not between years. Pre- and post-remedial PCB concentrations and liver EROD activity also were evaluated. There was a reduction in Aroclor 1254 and sum of PCB concentrations in starling chick carcasses between pre- and post-remediation. However, Aroclor 1254 and sum of PCB concentrations in starling chick carcasses at remediated sites were still significantly greater than those measured in starling carcasses at reference sites. Although liver EROD activity measured in starling chicks prior to remediation was greater than that measured in chicks during 1998 (following remediation), but less than EROD activity measured in chicks during 1999, activity levels tended to be less at reference sites. During 1998 liver EROD activity at both remediated sites was significantly greater than activity measured at the reference site, however during 1999, liver EROD activity only differed between the reference and AL remediated sites. Our studies indicated that PCB concentrations have decreased in starling chicks at remediated sites relative to concentrations measured at these sites prior to remediation. Even though concentrations at remediated sites remain greater than concentrations measured at reference sites, there has been a concomitant decrease in factors potentially associated with adverse effects. Parental care, egg hatching rates, and fledging success suggest a similarity between starlings nesting at remediated and reference sites. These results indicate that adverse reproduction and behavioral effects reported by Arenal and Halbrook (1997) may no longer be of concern to avian species utilizing remediated habitats on CONWR. The use of the starling as a model for evaluating potential effects of contaminants on avian species has been successful and demonstrates the value of biological monitoring as a mechanism for evaluating environmental contamination and the efficacy of remediation.",
