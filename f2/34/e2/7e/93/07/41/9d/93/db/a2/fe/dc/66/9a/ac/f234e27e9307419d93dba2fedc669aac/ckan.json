    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Among thermal control methods, variable-emittance materials remain the most promising for addressing deficiencies of current systems (mechanical louvers, loop heat pipes, MEMS, electrostatics, phase change materials, others), especially, e.g., for missions in extreme light/dark environments, planetary platforms. This firm's unique, patented variable-emittance skin technology, based on conducting polymers, microporous membranes and ionic liquids, with proven, space-environment performance, remains at the world forefront, with highest known Delta-emittance, good Turn-Down Ratio (TDR), very low power, low cost. Phase I work demonstrated separate emittance variation from 0.065 to 0.816,  Delta-emittance &gt; 0.48, and long-term space durability, with one \"breakthrough\" innovation, two  very significant innovations. A clear, specific pathway was demonstrated for combining low/high emittance in single devices to achieve TDR of 7.1, possibly 10.0. Phase II work will use this as basis to increase the TDR to &gt; 7.1, possibly &gt; 10.0, keeping the dark-state emittance ca. &gt;/= 0.80.  Surface Solar Absorptance will be further reduced from present ca. 0.31 to as low as possible (objective 0.09 to 0.24). Other Phase II tasks, following completion of TDR optimization, will address Controller, further space-qualification testing, manufacture, space-flights,  commercialization pathway, other issues. Two identified commercial partners will assist in marketing.",
