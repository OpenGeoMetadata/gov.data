    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Natural User Interface (NUI) is a term used to describe a number of technologies such as speech recognition, multi-touch, and kinetic interfaces. Gesture and voice control are two exciting computer input modalities for the NUI. Some believe that NUI is the next step forward from the traditional graphical user interface (GUI), which employs a mouse and keyboard as the primary means of input. The goal of NUI is to develop interfaces that do not have a steep learning curve and the interactions with these interfaces are &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; and intuitive to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of current GUIs is that they require the users to be physically near an input device in order to interact with the system. With the NUI, however, through using voice and gesture commands, the user is able to interact with the system &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; they want within the defined work environment. Such &amp;ldquo;Interface Anywhere&amp;rdquo; gesture ability is achievable using infrared technology. The voice recognition portion is achievable through array microphones and Kinect software. Our NUI system of choice for this proof of concept is the Microsoft Kinect sensor. The heart of the system and what makes gesture recognition possible is the Kinect&amp;rsquo;s skeleton tracking ability. The Kinect contains an infrared projector and receiver, a normal RGB camera, and an array of four microphones. The system tracks multiple users in x-, y-, and z-space. Based on the depth information, the Kinect generates a skeleton using joint position.&lt;/p&gt;",
