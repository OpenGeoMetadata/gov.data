  "notes": " The structural load floor is a 120 ft. by 40 ft. strong floor with the capability to provide complex static and dynamic loading patterns to large-scale structural models of buildings, building components, and other structural elements. The facility includes a high bay testing area with a 20 ton capacity overhead crane, that has a maximum clearance of 34 ft. A reaction wall is also located on the load floor.   The load floor incorporates a rectangular grid of 3 inch diameter loading points spaced 3 ft. on-center. These serve as tie-down points for a large &amp;quot;erector set&amp;quot; of steel columns, channels and beams which are used to construct loading fixtures and reaction frames. Each tie-down point has a capacity of 60,000 lbs. in any direction.   The facility includes a hydraulic loading system consisting of a series of independent closed loop controlled actuators which can be placed as required to develop complex loading patterns under static or dynamic conditions, and a large array of loading jacks for tests which are purely static.   Computer-controlled data acquisition systems are available with capacities of up to 200 data channels. This facility is a unique resource because it is one of only a few in this country capable of performing structural tests on large scale and full size structures.  ",
