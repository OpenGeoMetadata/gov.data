  "notes": "Edge refers to the linear topological primitives that make up MTDB. The All Lines Shapefile contains linear features such as roads, railroads, and hydrography. Additional attribute data associated with the linear features found in the All Lines Shapefile are available in relationship (.dbf) files that users must download separately. The All Lines Shapefile contains the geometry and attributes of each topological primitive edge. Each edge has a unique TIGER/Line identifier (TLID) value.",
