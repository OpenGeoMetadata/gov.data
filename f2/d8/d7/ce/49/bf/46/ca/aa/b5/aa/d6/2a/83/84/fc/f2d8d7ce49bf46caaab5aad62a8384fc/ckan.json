    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In an attempt to build more computationally powerful systems and improve the FLOPS/dollar and FLOPS/Watt of high-performance computers (HPCs), we have recently seen the proliferation of GPU-based clusters.  Many major vendors are now supporting this technology and such systems are becoming increasingly common everywhere from university research labs to the Top500 supercomputer list.  To take advantage of these systems, however, requires understanding a new programming paradigm, namely the ability to program GPUs.  In this project, we propose the development of tools to make programming massive GPU clusters transparent to the developer, thus allowing them to access their extreme computational power without significant additional effort.  Specifically, we propose the development of dense and sparse linear algebra libraries that are optimized for the underlying GPU hardware but are called by the user from a standard, high-level interface.  This work will build off our NASA-funded and commercially-successful CULA libraries, a set of GPU-accelerated, dense linear algebra libraries that run on single GPUs.  More recently we have begun adding sparse linear algebra libraries to this package and prototyping their transition to multiple GPUs located in a single node.  The proposed effort will involve scaling this technology so it is available on massive GPU clusters, thus making the power of such systems easily accessible to all programmers.",
