    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Embedded wireless sensors of the future will enable flight vehicle systems to be \"highly aware\" of onboard health and performance parameters, as well as the external flow field and potential threat environments.  Because there will be no opportunity to replace batteries on a regular basis, these systems will have to rely on energy harvesting strategies to convert ambient energy into electrical energy to provide long-lived power.  TPL proposes to develop a micropower system that will combine TPL's patented microbatteries and microsupercapacitors with vibrational energy harvesting for use with wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.  The solution proposed will include all components required for a complete power supply for wireless SHM sensors, including proprietary power regulation and conditioning circuitry that draws very low power.  \r\nTPL is a leader in designing and manufacturing power for light weight, minimum volume, minimum footprint, wireless systems.  TPL's effort has been supported by Goodrich Fuel and Utility Systems whose expertise with Structural Health Monitoring will provide guidance on sensor requirements, integration and packaging.  These relationships will facilitate realizing devices that will meet end-user requirements, and provide a commercialization pathway for Phase III.\r\n",
