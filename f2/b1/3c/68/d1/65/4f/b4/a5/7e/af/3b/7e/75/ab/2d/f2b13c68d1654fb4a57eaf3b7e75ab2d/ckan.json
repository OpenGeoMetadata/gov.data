  "notes": "The Upper Kansas River Watershed Land Cover Patterns map represents Phase 1 of a two-phase mapping initiative occurring over a three-year period as part of a National Science Foundation, EPSCoR grant to study ecological forecasting in the Kansas River Watershed. The map is designed to be explicitly comparable to the 1990 Kansas Land Cover Patterns map. Using a similar methodology to produce the 2005 Upper Kansas River Water Land Cover Patterns map provides opportunities to model and evaluate the impacts landcover change in the Kansas portion of the study area over a 15-year period, with the potential for similar analysis for Nebraska and Colorado portion provided that similar historical data are available. The map contains eleven land use/land cover classes. The positional accuracy and spatial resolution of the map are appropriate for producing 1:50,000 scale maps. The map is not intended to define precise boundaries between landscape features and while the source data has a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m, the minimum map unit varies by land cover class and ranges between 0.22 to 5.12 acres (see below). The formal accuracy assessment, which was conducted only for the Kansas portion of the study area due to limited funding, reports the map to have an overall accuracy level of 90.72%. User and Producer accuracies vary by land cover class and rural classes have higher accuracy levels (88-95%) than urban classes (48-78%). Users are encouraged to reference the reported accuracy levels in this report and/or metadata when using the 2005 Kansas Land Cover Patterns map. Digital versions of the map, metadata, and accuracy assessment can be accessed from the Data Access Support Center (DASC) website of the Kansas Geological Survey (http://www.kansasgis.org/) or the website of the Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Program (http://kars.ku.edu/).",
