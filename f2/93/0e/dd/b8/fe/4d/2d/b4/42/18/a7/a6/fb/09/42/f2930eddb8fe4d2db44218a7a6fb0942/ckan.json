    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Solar cell is the key device in generating electrical power for spacecrafts. It is an on-going challenge in maximizing electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array. While the \"record\" solar cells approach the theoretical limit after several decades of extensive R&amp;D effort, it becomes ever-increasingly difficult and cost prohibitive to further increasing their efficiency, by continuingly playing with existing solar cell fabrication protocols.\r\n\r\nSun Innovations proposes a highly innovative alternative approach in significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10&#37;), specific power density, the radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost and weight to the existing solar cells. It is also a generic approach that shall enhance the efficiency and lifetime of most commercial solar cells for broad based commercial benefits. The key nano-crystalline materials will be developed in Phase I, to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in record cells. The technology will be further developed in Phase II to be ready for commercialization in Phase III. \r\n",
