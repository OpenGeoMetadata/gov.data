    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;div&gt;\r\n\tPlanetary entry and near-Earth object return missions with an anticipated heat flux between 1,500 and 10,000 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are currently limited to one viable TPS material - fully dense carbon phenolic (CP). However, high-density CP is only mass efficient at heat fluxes above 4000 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This mid-density TPS performance gap can be filled using cost-effective weaving technology to produce high-grade, conformal, mid- to high-density TPS. Woven TPS not only bridges this gap but also offers a superior performing replacement for heritage CP.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\tA woven TPS approach can result in TPS solutions that are optimized to a given mission&amp;#39;s environments but with much-reduced costs compared to current TPS development and certification approaches. The woven TPS approach utilizes a stable U.S. weaving industrial base and processes that has a proven legacy and longevity in manufacturing commercial and advanced aerospace products. This industry has demonstrated capability to weave highly complex patterns in a 3D weave configuration for commercial applications.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\tThe Woven TPS Project will demonstrate this concept in partnership with a reliable industrial weaver selected through a Request for Information process in a 14-month program. We will accomplish this by designing and manufacturing a series of low-, mid- and high-density samples of woven carbon fiber material of varying yarn compositions, weave architectures, and level of resin infiltration and by testing them at extreme conditions. It is the project&amp;#39;s goal to develop a preliminary database, compare the performance of woven TPS against heritage fully dense CP, and raise the woven TPS from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 at the start of the project to TRL 3 at project completion.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n",
