    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optra will build an Advanced 3D Object Identification System utilizing three or more high resolution imagers spaced around a launch platform.  Data from each imager will be analyzed in real time using a complex morphological image processing scheme to extract up to 100 objects of interest.  These objects will then be individually tracked in the field-of-view of each imager then correlated between imagers to produce an accurate three-dimensional trajectory of each object with estimated ground impact position.  Information from each imager's field-of-view is then be used to discern object size and shape information.  The system is designed to be completely automated from launch through failure.   The primary focus of the Phase I effort is development of the image processing algorithms involved with detecting, tracking, and identifying the objects of interest.  The algorithms will be further refined during the Phase II effort and a prototype of the system will be built.  Phase II preliminary field tests are planned in which recreational parachutists leaving an aircraft will be tracked and imaged from two stations. These tests will prepare the equipment and personnel for the recorded observation of a live rocket launch, with booster or stage separation, near the end of the program.",
