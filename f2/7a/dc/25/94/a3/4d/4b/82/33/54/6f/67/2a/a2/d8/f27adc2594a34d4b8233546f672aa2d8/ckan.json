  "notes": " Colorado State University has received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its Space-Time Aquatic Resources Modeling and Analysis Program (STARMAP). EPA&amp;#39;s Office of Research and Development (ORD) funded this Program through its Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. A companion program at Oregon State University , which links to the CSU project, also was funded. STARMAP, which is housed in CSU&amp;#39;s Department of Statistics, has three major goals:  to conduct statistical research related to aquatic resources, to train future generations of environmental statisticians, and to engage in outreach to the States and Tribes. One principal objective of STARMAP is to transfer the needed statistical expertise through a combination of supervised application of statistical tools and structured distance-learning techniques, especially with web-based learning materials.
