    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Supercomputing plays a major role in many areas of science and engineering, and it has had tremendous impact for decades in areas such as aerospace, defense, energy, finance, and telecommunications?to name just a few.  Supercomputing enables many of our most important high-tech tools, and nowhere is it more important than at NASA, where attaining increased computing speed and performance at lower costs are constant objectives.  The goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is exactly that?to develop, validate, and commercialize next-generation supercomputing capabilities that provide NASA and other government/commercial users with massive increases in speed at minimal cost and with reduced energy requirements and  significant \"footprint\" efficiency.\r\nIn Phase I of this NASA SBIR project, Accelogic successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing the world's first reconfigurable computing linear equation (banded) solver for large-scale computing problems?such as those seen in aerospace applications?with greatly increased speed using an FPGA chip.  The speed attained was equivalent to 240 CPU's per FPGA chip for banded systems?which represents nearly a 60x computing speedup (surpassing the 50x Phase I target).  Accelogic's Phase I success sets the stage for a Phase II effort focused on prototyping/validating an initial supercomputing acceleration product.  The Phase II technical goal is to demonstrate the potential for 1,000x speedup.  \r\nDuring Phase I, Accelogic has proven it is ideally positioned to capitalize upon recent advances in reconfigurable computing?many of which were attained by Accelogic's own experts.  Applications for the products targeted by this project include many that are of interest to NASA, DOD, DOE, and many commercial entities.  Based on Phase I results and the clear commercial potential, Accelogic has obtained interest/commitment letters from well-established commercial vendors and key NASA contractors, including Silicon Graphics.
