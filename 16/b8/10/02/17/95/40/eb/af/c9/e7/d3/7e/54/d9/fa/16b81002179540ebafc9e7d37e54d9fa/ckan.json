  "notes": "At Mancha Creek, an area within the foresttundra ecotone, five major habitat types were identified and studied intensively for aspects of vegetation composition, plant species diversity, and status, distribution,and relative abundance of bird and mammal species. The five habitats studied were Wet Sedge Meadow, Low Shrub ThicketWet Sedge Meadow, Tall WillowPoplar Thicket, White Spruce Woodland, and White Spruce Forest. Thirteen other less prevalent habitat types were identified.A total of 192 plant species were observed on the study area. The greatest plant species diversity occurred in the White Spruce Woodland, while the lowest diversity occurred on the Low Shrub ThicketWet Sedge Meadow. A new species, or at least hybrid of two species, of Oxytropis was discovered illustrated on page 36 . Eightyseven bird species were documented on the study area. Over half of the bird spP.cies were breeders, whereas only seven were permanent residents. The avifauna was composed largely of taigaboreal forest breeders, with a minority of specifically arctic or montane, or Alpine Tundra breeders. Bird populations in the forest and woodland habitats were similar to the levels characteristic of the same habitat types in the interior. The Tall Shrub Thicket habitat was depauperate compared to its taiga counterpart. Population levels in the tundra habitats were similar to those levels typical of the arctic tundra on the Wildlife Range. The extensive cliff habitats of the Mancha Creek area were occupied primarily by Golden Eagles, with lesser numbers of Gyrfalcons and Roughlegged Hawks. The Grayheaded Chickadee cover photo was documented as breeding on the study area, the first such record for Alaska.Fifteen mammal species were recorded on the study area. Showshoe hares were close to a population high, while most small mammal species were unusually low. The Tall WillowPoplar Thicket supported the highest small mammal numbers, largely Redbacked Voles. The area also supported one of the farthest north recorded Beaver populations in Alaska. Moose commonly wintered in the Mancha Creek Valley, and Caribou were an abundant migrant and winter resident in 1979.",
