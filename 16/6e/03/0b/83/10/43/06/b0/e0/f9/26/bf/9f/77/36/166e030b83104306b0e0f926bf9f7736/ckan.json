    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Over the next few decades, NASA plans to launch a number of planetary probes to and return the samples to Earth for detailed investigation.  Due to the rapid expanse of space exploration, a need has been identified for the proper handling of extraterrestrial samples.  Not only must the sample return system maintain the physical integrity of the sample in sometimes rigorous conditions (e.g., rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations, cruise, atmospheric entry and impact), it must address potential contamination issues.  The samples themselves can become contaminated and they also present a serious contamination danger to the Earth.  Therefore, the highest possible level of precaution must be exercised when handling the outer space samples until there are studies proving them harmless.  \r\nIn this Phase I project, we are proposing a \"foam-in-the-capsule\" system for containing and encapsulating samples of extraterrestrial material to be returned to Earth for detailed study.  The system will eliminate or dramatically reduce the risk of contamination on flight hardware and ease the handling of the sample on the spacecraft, in landing, and in the process of sample transfer to the appropriate facility for investigation.  The \"foam-in-the-capsule\" system combines the effectiveness of encapsulation and flexibility to improve design according to new scientific data or changes in the capsule carrier's interior.  The proposed system consists of a compliant outer restraint based upon the DoverPac&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; system for containment of potent pharmaceutical powders and a foam-in-place encapsulation process.  The decontamination foam will be effectively sealed within the inflatable polymer capsules.  The dimensions of the capsules are variable to fit the dimensions of the sample to be encapsulated.  Sterilization of the encapsulated sample container before opening through the incineration of the foam encapsulant is possible.\r\n",
