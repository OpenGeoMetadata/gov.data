    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis units are currently\ndesigned to require active water flow and phase separation, or are based\non a passive vapor transport mechanism that inherently limits\nperformance due to mass-transport limitations.  ElectroChem has\ndeveloped and successfully demonstrated a passive water transport\nIntegrated Flow Field concept (its IFF Structure) that controls the flow\nof water through each cell, in a highly reliable, performance enhancing,\nand gravity independent manner. By enabling the passive transport of\nliquid water to and from the membrane, it simplifies the structure of\nthe electrolyzer system while avoiding performance limits due to mass\ntransfer problems that have plagued conventional electrolyzers.\nElectroChem will develop a high performance electrolysis unit that is\nbased on the passive transport of liquid water into, within, and out of\nthe cell.  A custom-designed IFF cell structure will be developed during\nPhase I to refine approaches to optimized performance under a wide range\nof conditions, including gravity independence, higher current, and\nprolonged-period stable operation.  The Phase II program will focus on\nmulti-cell stack development and higher pressure modifications in\nsupport of energy storage systems free of mechanical compressors and\nwater circulation pumps.",
