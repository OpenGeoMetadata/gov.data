  "notes": "This data set contains vector point information. The orignal data set was collected through visual field observation by Greg Linscombe of LDWF and Robert H. Chabreck of LSU Agricultural Center. The observations were made while flying over the study areas (Louisiana Coastal Zone) in a Bell 206 Jet Ranger helicopter. Flight was along north/south transects spaced 1.87 miles apart from the Texas state line to the Mississippi state line. Vegetative data was obtained at pre-determined stations spaced at 0.5 miles along each transect. The stations were located using a Trimble Ag 122 Global Positioning system (GPS) and a computer running GPSView by Geowarehouse. This information was recorded manually into field tally sheets and later was entered into a Microsoft Access Database. At this point, this information was brought into a GIS application by converting the file to database format (dbf). A GIS software application was utilized to generate the points along the transect routes. The flight line data was used as a guide to generate the points along the transect routes. The data points produced were used as a guide for the production of marsh type delineation lines. The new data set resulted in a point coverage containing vegetative marsh type attributes along transect flight lines. Coverage is of the coastal region of the State of Louisiana.",
