In Iowa, these regions are composed of earth materials derived from glacial, wind, river, and marine environments of the geologic past. This is a new representation of the landform regions of Iowa, at a scale of 1:24,000, and derived from a variety of sources including soils, slope maps, topographic maps Paha Ridges are landforms that tend to be in the southern part of the Iowan Surface, that are prominant hills that are oriented from northwest to southeast, and typically have large deposits of loess on them. They were developed during the period of mass wasting that developed the Iowan surface, and are considered erosional remnants and are often at interstream divides. Paha generally rise above the surrounding landscape more than 20 feet. The ridges of these Paha are often wooded with mixed oak components, and soils often indicate development under forest or transitional cover type. Collections of Paha are called lineated inliers and can be found in another coverage",
