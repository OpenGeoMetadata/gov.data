The six source data sets covered different parts of the state, were in differing formats, and used different legend classifications. MnDNR developed a generalized 8-category legend and translated each source data set's original detailed classification into the 8-category system. They also standardized the data to 30 meter grid cells. The data set was used to produce a 43 inch by 50 inch wall map of the same title.",
