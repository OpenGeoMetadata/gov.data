    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose a cognitively inspired architecture for deploying an automated intelligent onboard operator assistant. This assistant facilitates the onboard control while finding a compromise between increasing the operator's awareness of the system tasks and decreasing the operator's workload. The core of this assistant is an adaptive algorithm (AA) that determines the appropriate level of automation (LOA) for the current mission phase depending on factors such as the operator's workload and situation awareness, mission phase requirements and state, as well as human-automation interactions and supervisory control issues.\r\n\r\nThe goal of our proposed agent-based architecture is to facilitate the creation and evaluation of AA algorithms. In order to easily define AA strategies, the architecture provides facilities to explicitly represent, reason with, and update the state of the different knowledge structures needed by the AA. We will develop a testbed to evaluate different AAs regarding the operator's situation awareness in a multi-agent dynamic scenario. To promote experimenter control and rapid evaluations, a graphical behavior language will be used to define the behavior of entities in a simulator-based experimental scenario. Phase I will focus on the definition of the testbed and in creating a system prototype. Phase II will focus on making the architecture robust and testing it in a high fidelity simulator.\r\n",
