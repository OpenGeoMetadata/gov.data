The temperature is calculated using the Emissivity Normalization Algorithm that separate temperature from emissivity. The incoming solar radiation was calculated using spatial based insolation model developed by Fu and Rich (1999). Then the temperature due to solar radiation was calculated using emissivity derived from ASTER data. The residual temperature, i.e. temperature due to solar radiation subtracted from ASTER temperature was used to identify thermally anomalous areas. Areas that had temperature greater than 2σ were considered ASTER modeled “very warm modeled surface temperature” are shown in red on the map.  Areas that had temperatures between 1σ and 2σ were considered ASTER modeled “warm modeled surface temperature” are shown in yellow on the map. \n\nThis map also includes the locations of shallow temperature survey points, locations of springs or wells with favorable geochemistry, faults, transmission lines, and areas of modeled basement weakness “fairways”.\n\n\nContact Information: \nContact Organization: \nEarth Science &Observation Center (ESOC), CIRES, University of Colorado at Boulder \nContact Person:  Khalid Hussein \nAddress: \nCIRES, Ekeley Building \nEarth Science & Observation Center (ESOC) \n216 UCB \nCity:  Boulder  State:  CO  Postal Code:  80309-0216  Country:  USA \nContact Telephone:  303-492-6782 \nSpatial Reference Information: \nCoordinate System:  Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) WGS’1984 Zone 13N \nFalse Easting:  500000.00000000 \nFalse Northing:  0.00000000 \nCentral Meridian:  -105.00000000 \nScale Factor:  0.99960000 \nLatitude of Origin:  0.00000000 \nLinear Unit:  Meter \nDatum:  World Geodetic System ’1984 (WGS ’1984) \nPrime Meridian:  Greenwich \nAngular Unit:  Degree \nDigital Form: \nFormat Name: PDF\n",
