  "notes": " The Mortar Fire Control Programs System Integration Lab is a 2478 square-foot Software Support Environment (SSE). The Lab contains all target fielded hardware and software tools required to support all Mortar Fire Control Programs, such as the Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS) and the Lightweight Hand Held Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC). Testing consists of the operational software which includes integration testing and software formal qualification testing. The MFSC consists of 6 complete test station environments, where each environment supports testing as a mortar platoon, including associated Fire Support Network assets with a Fire Direction Center (FDC), FBCB2, FOS, AFATDS. Multiple gun configurations are constructed to perform multiple-gun testing. The mortar lab is also equipped with outdoor radio antennas mounted on the building&amp;#39;s rooftop that facilitate communicating with the FDC M577, Stryker Vehicle and 1064 Gun platforms throughout the arsenal area to support navigation testing. A rooftop mounted GPS antenna provides GPS signal that is networked and re-radiated through out the laboratory, thus eliminating multiple GPS antennas and providing GPS signal in the laboratories and highbay area. The Lab also consists of post-fielding stations and hardware kitting area for system fielding such as that performed for the LHMBC.  ",
