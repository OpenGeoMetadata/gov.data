  "notes": " \n        Evaluation design: Impact Evaluation\n1. Pre-post comparison of time and cost involving in select land-based transactions\n2. Involve two main instruments of measurement: Back Office time tracking survey and the Banking survey\n3. Qualitative interviews were conducted with registry officers to inform the understanding of how these measures affected workflow\n\nEvaluation question: \nDid some of the institutional strengthening activities of PRP reduce time and cost of completing land-based transactions? \n\nThe institutional strengthening activities that can be evaluated are the installation of web-based electronic registry system (ePRS), the revision to law that govern access to property records law, and the digitization of paper archives. \n\nResults: \nBack Office Time Tracking survey - Tracked 9 land based transactions at General Authority of State Registry (GASR) - Shortest process, registering a collateral agreement took 6 work days. Longest process, registering land or structure on land took 12 days. Transactions took 3-6 days longer than official time posted by GASR. \n\nBanking survey - Tracked time it takes to apply for a mortgage or land-based loan including time it takes to prepare document, to submit and wait for bank approval, and to visit GASR offices to register for the mortgage or loan. Mortgage - 25 days for loan process and 14 days to prepare paperwork for loan application, total cost 360 USD. For land based loan - took 13 days for the loan process and 7.5 days to prepare paperwork, total cost 130 USD. \n\nInformational interviews - Mixed responses. All officers agree that there has been changes to the registration flow. However, lack of consensus on whether the changes have shortened the weight time for citizens. While opening of district offices have shortened travel distance for some citizens, multiple locations meant that documents had to travel to the main office for official signatures. All officers agreed that workload increased yet workforce did not. There was consensus that more people are registering due to increased awareness and growing construction sector. Officers also noted that government mandated 8% mortgage has increased demand for mortgages. Officers agree that technical upgrades provided by PRP have improved efficiency and that outreach activity had educated the public regarding property rights.\n      ",
