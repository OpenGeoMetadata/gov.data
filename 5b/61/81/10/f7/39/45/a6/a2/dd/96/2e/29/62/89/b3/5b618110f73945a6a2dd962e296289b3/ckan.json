    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This project is focused on developing a continually evolving modular backbone architecture for the Deep Space Habitat (DSH) instrumentation system by integrating new instrumentation technologies and technology demonstrations into the DSH.&amp;nbsp; By creating a modular architecture, instrumentation can be easily&amp;nbsp; changed out in the event of failures, or upgraded to newer versions of hardware.&amp;nbsp; The instrumentation system is continuously evolving as hardware is upgraded as a result of lessons learned from previous tests, and as new hardware is implemented to evaluate new technologies and technology demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accomplishments: A Flat Surface Damage Detection System (FSDDS) panel (KSC technology) was successfully integrated with DSH software and tested over SNRF networks.&amp;nbsp; This demonstration proves the capability of interconnecting testbeds and enables future technology development/testing in this manner.&amp;nbsp; The FSDDS also successfully tested multiple panels interconnected in a standalone configuration; A Radiation Environment Monitor (REM) was successfully integrated and tested.&amp;nbsp; The team also collected important data on background radiation levels; The RFID system previously developed for the Geology Laboratory Workstation was further integrated with software.&amp;nbsp; This system successfully tracked all rock samples and organized the data for each sample; An RFID system was successfully integrated into the medical operations workstation to provide inventory management of medical devices and supplies; A portable Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was integrated as a standalone test.&amp;nbsp; The FTIR was successfully tested and the data provided interesting science on the composition of the internal atmosphere of the DSH, as well as the activities of the crew during the tests; Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), the backbone architecture for the wireless modular instrumentation system in the DSH, were upgraded to account for lessons learned from the previous year.&amp;nbsp; The upgrades proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
