    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase 2 project shall develop sputter-resistant materials for\nuse in electric propulsion test facilities and for plume shields on\nspacecraft using electric thrusters.  A critical need arises because\nNASA is developing higher impulse, higher power thrusters for deep space\nscience missions.  Such thrusters will erode chamber walls ten-times\nmore aggressively than before and create unacceptably high levels of\ncontamination in the life test facilities. Without new materials that\nare ten-times more resistant than graphite, the only alternative may be\ninstallation of larger vacuum test chambers at huge facility cost.   The\nproposed sputter-resistant materials are based on carbon fibers in a\nhighly textured configuration that allows deep penetration of incident\nions and trapping of sputtered secondary atoms.  Phase 1 testing has\ndemonstrated a 5x reduction in sputter backflow toward the ion source,\nconsistent with modeling predictions. It appears feasible to extend the\nuse of existing test facilities at least into planned near term testing\nof next generation ion engines.   Phase 2 will develop thicker\nlow-contamination chamber liners intended for long duration exposure,\nand modeling tools will be developed to aid in the design of baffled\nchamber liners. Lightweight rigid plume shields for spacecraft using EP\nwill be demonstrated and offered for testing. Removable, cleanable,\nliner configurations will be demonstrated for use  with condensable\nliquid metal propellants. Sputter testing will be performed by CSU using\nhemispherical witness plates to rapidly acquire directional yield data.\nLow-contamination chamber liner materials designed for use in testing\nhigh current, high voltage ion sources will be delivered under the\ncontract for evaluation by NASA.",
