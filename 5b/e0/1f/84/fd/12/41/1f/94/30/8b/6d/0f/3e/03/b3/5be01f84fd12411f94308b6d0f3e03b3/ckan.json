    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a technology that will reduce cost and manufacturing time, broaden design options, and improve performance of large space optics.  \r\nPrimarily addressed is light weighting ULE glass mirrors for large telescope systems.  \r\n\r\nWhile milling and cutting materials such as ULE or SiC is often performed at Ormond using a novel abrasivejet technology, there is a need to develop this technology to a the requirements of large optics manufacturing.\r\nIn Phase I, Ormond proprietary glass and ceramic cutting and milling technologies were adapted to AMTD-2 requirements through software, process and tool development.  The technology is now at TRL5 and technology feasibility has been demonstrated.  \r\n\r\nA demonstration coupon was machined based on the current AMTD mirror concept at rates several times faster than conventional grinding can accomplish.  This design has 0.75 inch deep hex cell pockets in the mirror back, the same as would exist on a full scale mirror.  Rough semi-elliptical optical surface machining was also demonstrated in Schott glass.  Tooling designed in the Phase II program will support substantial improvements in risk mitigation, tolerance holding capability and material removal rates.\r\n\r\nThis work will continue to be performed with close interaction with NASA and Exelis to insure that the work directly supports current and future program needs.  The Phase II program will result in a working system that is capable of completing a 1/3 scale model of the AMTD-2 mirror with tremendous cost savings, schedule reduction and risk reduction compared to grinding.  Capacity for full scale up will be demonstrated during Phase II.",
