  "notes": "This is a point dataset containing the location of over 230,000 oil and gas and injection wells in the state of Louisiana. It was developed from the DNR Office of Conservation Oracle database compiled from all wells permitted since the industry was first regulated in the early 1900's. Data fields for the wells are listed in the \"Attributes\" section of this document. This oil and gas well dataset was processed on January 4, 2007 for the Louisiana 2007 GIS DVD from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) Oracle database/ESRI SDE well files. These data are updated daily and can be downloaded from the LDNR oil/gas well download site - http://sonris-gis.dnr.state.la.us/website/DownloadLogin.html . Detailed information from the DNR Oracle database for the attribute codes can be accessed at LDNR's SONRIS web page (www.sonris.com) in the Office of Conservation Reports - Codes and Lookup Tables.",
