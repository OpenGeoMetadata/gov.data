    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Emergent Space Technologies Inc. proposes to develop the Ground Enterprise Management System (GEMS) for spacecraft ground systems.  GEMS will provide situational awareness for distributed ground systems, and an understanding of how events and automated actions impact the system in real-time.  Recent software advancements have improved sustainability, extensibility, fault tolerance, and ease of automation for ground systems.  These traits are important for NASA's missions, from Exploration to Earth and Space Science, but can pose challenges, especially when the system has a high degree of interoperability and communications between components that isn't visible to the end-user.  Operators can quickly become overwhelmed with the increased complexity of software components constantly exchanging data and the volumes of information being passed around behind-the-scenes.  In fact, for largely distributed systems, as much \"situational awareness\" is needed for the ground system as for the spacecraft itself.  GEMS will provide a centralized integration framework that is needed to provide operators with transparency into the ground system, its state, and its component interactions.  GEMS will enhance plug-and-play integrations while providing information management and system coordination.  The innovation that enables GEMS is the development of \"data-driven\" algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state, organizes the data, and displays it to the mission operators.",
