  "notes": "A multibeam backscatter image (0-35 m water depths) mosaiced from hydrographic data collected during a August/September 2003seafloor survey. A Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) was hull mounted to NOAAS Rainier survey launch Ra3 to acquire the sonar data. A Applanix POS/MV was used to compensate for vessel motion and a Seabird SVP 19 plus was used to measure sound speed. Navigation and line planning were accomplished using Hypack software using a CSI wireless DPGS. Sonar packets, motion sensor, and navigation data were logged in Isis Sonar as XTF files. Backscatter was normalized and mosaiced using software developed by the University of New Brunswick Ocean Mapping Group.",
