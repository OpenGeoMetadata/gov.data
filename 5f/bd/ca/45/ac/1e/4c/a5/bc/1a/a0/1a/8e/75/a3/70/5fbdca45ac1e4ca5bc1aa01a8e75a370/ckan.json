  "notes": "In the late fall of 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will remove a 121 ft. long-line fishing vessel grounded on the western terrace reef of the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (Palmyra).  This is a high priority project and funding has been allocated by Washington and the Chief of the Refuge System to remove the wreck, but not to monitor and restore the affected coral reef.  The eroding wreck is acting as a “time release fertilizer”, fueling the growth of an invasive corallimorph by releasing limited elements, such as iron, into the water.  The corallimorph is currently spreading over once pristine coral reefs, killing and smothering the corals and turning an area once rich in species diversity into a monotypic blanket of corallimorph.The Sandin and Smith Labs at the Scrip Institution of Oceanography (SIO) are members of the Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium (PARC), and have been working at Palmyra since 2005, looking at fish and benthic communities in the area.  These labs have been using permanent transects with photo quadrats, as well as photomosaic mapping of the benthos, for species surveys, and documentation of the invasive corallimorph. SIO in collaboration with Stanford University (another PARC member) are working together at Palmyra to understand the biotic and abiotic forcing within the coral reef ecosystems and how the Palmyra coral reefs are affected by climate change, global warming and specifically ocean acidification. Due to its protected status as a NWR Palmyra has few anthropogenic stressors and can be used as a model for resilience and restoration of coral reefs. The removal of the wreck and subsequent restoration efforts, gives the service an opportunity to collect a robust data set of biotic and abiotic factors for a Before-After-Control-Impact study design to determine the effects of wreck removal, and the subsequent succession of native species after invasive species removal.  A series of experimental plots have demonstrated that the corallimorph can be successfully removed from large spots, in areas of monotypic corallimorph cover, in situ by tarping them and inoculating the tarps with chlorine tablets.  Small areas in coral rich areas can be controlled in situ by covering the polyps with calcium carbonate slurry.The project objectives include; 1) Evaluating the effects of the shipwreck removal on the benthic and fish communities, by surveying the area pre-removal effort, to get a current understanding of the extent of the corallimorph spread, and its effects on the benthic and fish communities.  Then repeating the surveys post removal and restoration efforts to 2) Determine succession patterns on corallimorph-cleared patches of the reef in high density areas and sites where smaller outbreaks of corallimorph are occurring.  Succession in removal plots will provide valuable information for conservation and management efforts.",
