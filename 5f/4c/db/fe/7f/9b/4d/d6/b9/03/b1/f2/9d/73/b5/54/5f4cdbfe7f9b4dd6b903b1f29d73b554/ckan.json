      "value": "   Capabilities:      Arc Range:The laminated wooden Arc has a radius of 75 feet, with a 60 foot, 80 ton capacity turntable centered at its base. The turntable rotates 360 degrees in azimuth to provide a polar or rectangular antenna pattern. Hemispherical, measurements can be taken at greater than a single hemisphere cut from -13 to +90 degrees. At the focal point of the Arc a wooden test pedestal (20&amp;#39;X22&amp;#39;X22&amp;#39;) can be utilized to hold test vehicles up to 10 tons. The Arc facility supports antenna testing from 20 MHz up to 18 GHz.   Red Antenna Tower: A 114 foot wooden Antenna Tower is located 500 feet from the Arc. An additional 30 foot turntable capable of 60 tons is located another 500 feet further from the Arc. The tower, centered between the Arc and small turntable, is equipped with antenna sleds on those two sides. The sleds allow elevation of test or measurement antennas between ground level and 100 feet. These assets, in concert with numerous surveyed points forming a semi-circle around the small turntable, provide RF signal and test item position capabilities for conducting specialized test of direction finding, emitter identification and other RF signal processing systems.   Compact Range: Tests requiring precise far-field measurements at higher microwave frequencies are conducted on EPG&amp;#39;s Compact Range (CR). This test range covers the frequency range of 6 to 40 GHz. The CR is able to position items weighing up to 70 tons and up to 50 feet in size. The pedestal is capable of raising test items from 0 to 90 degrees while rotating it an entire 360 degrees in azimuth. This provides a capability for handling any ground vehicles in the U.S. military inventory. The Compact Range is believed to be the largest facility of its kind in the world. "
