    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The Avionics Architectures for Exploration Project team will develop a system level environment and architecture that will accommodate equipment from multiple vendors in order to benchmark performance for missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). This will allow NASA to take advantage of strides being made by industry to drive our development and sustaining costs down. The project team will also evaluate emerging technologies in industry and academia to ensure that other potentially beneficial concepts are not overlooked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reference architecture will be developed by dividing it into three core areas: Command and Data Handling (C&amp;amp;DH), Communications, and Human Interfaces. The hardware selected for these core areas will typically be high TRL and currently available. The hardware must also have lineage that gives the team confidence that a radiation tolerant version that can survive the environment beyond Earth orbit will be available within a reasonable time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C&amp;amp;DH Team will focus on the areas of single board computers, network architecture and hardware, instrumentation systems, and hardware/network standards. They will address radiation tolerance issues with higher performance processors which are required to support the demands of human exploration. Various network technologies will be investigated for critical and non-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Communications Team will focus on developing a communications architecture that will operate over multiple mission phases and across various users, including international partners. They will take into account communications amongst several vehicles, EVA, and the ground. The communications team will consider systems that support multiple formats, reconfigurability, adaptive power control, and other cognitive capabilities as well as utilize wireless technology where possible to reduce vehicle weight (less wires). The system will have to address the high data rate demands of human exploration. The communications team will evaluate existing communications hardware from industry and other centers. They will also consider existing agency and international standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Interface Team will address the great challenge of providing displays, audio systems, video systems, and controls which will reliably function in the environment beyond low Earth orbit. They will evaluate new display technologies (such as OLEDs) and Graphics Processing Unit options (including a software GPU). Off the shelf video and audio systems will be evaluated for performance, integration within the architecture, and environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three teams will work together to produce a reliable and flexible reference avionics architecture that will be demonstrated in the Integrated Power, Avionics, and Software (iPAS) laboratory at JSC. The iPAS laboratory will provide an excellent place to infuse and validate new architectural components of the avionics architecture. The lab can support multiple vehicles of various avionics implementations communicating together in a mission scenario. Three integrated tests are planned throughout FY14 as the avionics architecture evolves.&lt;/p&gt;",
