    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Overview:  \r\n\r\nReADS can analyze text reports, such as aviation reports and problem or maintenance records.  ReADS uses text clustering algorithms to group loosely related reports and documents, this reduces human error and fatigue.  Plus, ReADS identifies interconnected reports; automating the discovery of possible recurring anomalies.  ReADS provides a visualization of the clusters and recurring anomalies. ReADS has been integrated into a secure web-based search tool to allow uses to perform their own text mining.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecurring Anomaly Identification\r\n\r\nReADS identifies reports which mention other reports as a recurring anomaly using regular expressions to search documents and identify references of other reports by name. ReADS also detects recurring anomalies by determining the similarity between documents using a cosine distance similarity measure.  Then according to the similarity measure, ReADS will run a hierarchical clustering algorithm to detect the recurring anomalies.  The hierarchical tree is partitioned into clusters by setting a threshold. A low threshold implies that the reports must be very similar to be sorted into the same cluster.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere's more [info](http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/pria/).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe figure below is a screenshot of the clustering results.
