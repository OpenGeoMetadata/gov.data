    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Aerodynamic control surfaces with excessive free-play can cause limit cycle oscillations (LCO), a sustained vibration of constant amplitude that is caused by a combination of aeroservoelastic effects and free-play. The LCO can impact handling qualities, ride quality and can cause structural fatigue, ultimately leading to structural failure. Due to the negative impacts of free-play induced LCO, very stringent absolute free-play limits have been established for control surfaces on both military and commercial aircraft. Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) and Boeing propose to develop an innovative, robust, and reliable active control concept that alleviates the adverse effects of control surface free-play, relieving costly requirements associated with manufacturing, inspection, and part replacement. The solution involves a novel linear fractional transformation framework for relevance to models of varying complexity and a robust control approach that exploits the piecewise-linear nature of the free-play nonlinearity. To aid in control design and to provide practical real-world relevance, a combined analytical and experimental approach is proposed by the STI-Boeing team. The proposed solution is minimally intrusive, providing for application to a wide array of existing and future aircraft (including both high speed fighters and transport aircraft), ultimately resulting in significant cost savings and increased pilot safety.",
