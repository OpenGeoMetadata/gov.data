    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Petscale computing is leading to significant breakthroughs in a number of fields and is revolutionizing the way science is conducted. Data is not knowledge, however, and the challenge has been how to analyze and gain insight from the massive quantities of data that are generated.  In order to address the peta-scale visualization challenges, we propose to develop a scientific visualization software that would enable real-time visualization capability of extremely large data sets. We plan to accomplish this by extending the ParaView visualization architecture to extreme scales. ParaView is an open source software installed on all HPC sites including NASA's Pleiades and has a large user base in diverse areas of science and engineering. Our proposed solution will significantly enhance the scientific return from NASA HPC investments by providing the next generation of open source data analysis and visualization tools for very large datasets.  To test our solution on real world data with complex pipeline, we have partnered with SciberQuest, who have recently performed the largest kinetic simulations of magnetosphere using 25 K cores on Pleiades and 100 K cores on Kraken.  Given that IO is the main bottleneck for  scientific visualization at large scales, we propose to work closely with Pleiades's systems team and provide efficient prepackaged general purpose I/O component for ParaView for structured and unstructured data across a spectrum of scales and access patterns with focus on Lustre file system used by Pleiades.\r\n",
