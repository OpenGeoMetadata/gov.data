    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This paper considers the problem of change detection using local\r\ndistributed eigen monitoring algorithms for next generation\r\nof astronomy petascale data pipelines such as the Large Synoptic\r\nSurvey Telescopes (LSST). This telescope will take repeat images\r\nof the night sky every 20 seconds, thereby generating 30 terabytes of calibrated imagery every night that will need to be coanalyzed with other astronomical data stored at different locations around the world. Change point detection and event classification in such data sets may provide useful insights to unique astronomical phenomenon displaying astrophysically significant variations: quasars, supernovae, variable stars, and potentially hazardous asteroids. However, performing such data mining tasks is a challenging problem for such high-throughput distributed data streams. In this paper we propose a highly scalable and distributed asynchronous algorithm for monitoring the principal components (PC) of such dynamic data streams. We demonstrate the algorithm on a large set of distributed astronomical data to accomplish well-known astronomy tasks such as measuring variations in the fundamental plane of\r\ngalaxy parameters. The proposed algorithm is provably correct (i.e. converges to the correct PCs without centralizing any data) and can seamlessly handle changes to the data or the network. Real experiments performed on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue data show the effectiveness of the algorithm. ",
