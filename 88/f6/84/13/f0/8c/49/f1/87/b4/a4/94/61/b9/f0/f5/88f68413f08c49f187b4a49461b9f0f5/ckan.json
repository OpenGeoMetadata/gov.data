  "notes": " Aegis Ashore is a land-based capability of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System to address the evolving ballistic missile security environment. The deckhouse and launchers are equipped with the Aegis BMD Weapon System and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), with upgrades being phased in during this decade. Each Aegis BMD upgrade provides increased capability for countering ballistic missile threats. Aegis Ashore is part of the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) Phases II and III.  Development:  -Uses the same combat system elements (AN/SPY-1 Radar, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence systems, Vertical Launching System, computer processors, display system, power supplies and cooling) that are used onboard the Navy&amp;#39;s new construction Aegis BMD Destroyers. -Conducting flight tests at the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex at Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Kauai, Hawaii. Each test will increase the operational realism and complexity of targets and scenarios and will be witnessed by Navy and Department of Defense test agents. -Integrates advances in sensor technology such as launch of an SM-3 missile in response to remote sensor data. -Defeats short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. -Incorporates future capability upgrades in association with Aegis BMD Program of Record.  Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC)  -The AAMDTC at the PMRF is a test and evaluation center in the development of Aegis Ashore. The test complex leverages the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the SM-3 Block IB missile for European PAA Phase II deployment, as well as, supports deployment decisions and upgrades of future capabilities. -The AAMDTC fired the first land-based SM-3 Block IB missile in May 2014.  Deployment:  -In 2015, Aegis Ashore will be installed in Romania as part of the European PAA Phase II. This deployed capability will use Aegis B/L 9.BI (BMD 5.0 CU) and SM-3 Block IB to provide ballistic missile coverage of southern Europe. - In 2018, Aegis Ashore will be installed in Poland, as part of the European PAA Phase III. This deployed capability will use Aegis B/L 9.B2 (BMD 5.1) and SM-3 Blocks IB and IIA to support increased additional defense of Europe. -After the site in Poland becomes operational, the Romania site will be upgraded to B/L 9.B2 (BMD 5.1).  Future Capabilities:  - Engagement of longer range ballistic missiles  ",
