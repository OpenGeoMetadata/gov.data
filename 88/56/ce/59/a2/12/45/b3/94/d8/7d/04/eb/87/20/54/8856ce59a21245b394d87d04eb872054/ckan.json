  "notes": "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer Global Emissivity Database (ASTER GED) was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. The North America portion of this collection was formerly called the North American ASTER Land Surface Emissivity Database (NAALSED) - a seasonal dataset consisting of mean summer (J-A-S) and winter (J-F-M) products. ASTER GED products are output on 1degree x 1 degree grids at 100-meter or 1-kilometer spatial resolution (nominal) and include the mean emissivity and standard deviation for all 5 ASTER thermal infrared bands, mean land surface temperature (LST) and standard deviation, a re-sampled ASTER GDEM (not included in the North America Winter products), land-water mask, mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and standard deviation, latitude, longitude, and observation count. Additional ASTER GED product information is available at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/community_products_table. Product tiles are available in HDF and binary format and may be downloaded via HTTP by visiting the following data clients: NASA Reverb (http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov), LP DAAC Data Pool (http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/ASTT/), or EarthExplorer (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov).",
