  "notes": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Services Center's efforts to create an online mapping viewer called the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer. It depicts potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://coast.noaa.gov/slr This metadata record describes the Wilmington Weather Forecast Office (CHS WFO) digital elevation model (DEM), which is a part of a series of DEMs produced for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Services Center's Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer described above. The DEMs created for this project were developed using the NOAA National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Office (WFO) boundaries. This DEM includes the best available lidar known to exist at the time of DEM creation that met project specifications for the Wilmington WFO, which includes the coastal areas of the counties of Florence, Marion, and Williamsburg. Georgetown County, while in the ILM WFO area, is not included in this DEM because the data is proprietary. The DEM was produced from the following lidar data sets: 1. 2009 South Carolina Lidar Consortium Lidar: Florence County 2. 2008 South Carolina Lidar Consortium Lidar: Marion County 3. 2008 South Carolina Lidar Consortium Lidar: Williamsburg County 4. 2010 US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) JALBTCX Topobathy Lidar: Southeast (NC, SC, GA, FL) Hydrographic breaklines were delineated from LiDAR intensity imagery generated from the LiDAR dataset. The final DEM is hydro flattened such that water elevations are less than or equal to -0.5 meters. The DEM is referenced vertically to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with vertical units of meters and horizontally to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The resolution of the DEM is approximately 5 meters.",
