  "notes": "This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant recharge rate for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 1,305 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are composed of interfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and cross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The aquifer is composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits that unconformably overlie the Permian-age Formations. A recharge value of 2.3 inches per year is used in this report for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie Oklahoma. The recharge rate was estimated using a base-flow method and verified in a steady-state flow model. The polygon boundaries and the value for constant recharge for alluvial and terrace deposits used in this data set were published in a steady-state ground-water flow modeling report. The aquifer boundaries along geological contacts were extracted from published digital geology data sets. Additional boundaries defining the geographic limits of the aquifer and areas of less than 5 feet saturated thickness were digitized from a mylar map, at a scale of 1:250,000. The maps were published at a scale of 1:900,000. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",

Lines representing the geographic limits of the aquifer were digitized from a mylar map (33 inches by 31 inches), at a scale of 1:250,000. Hydraulic conductivity polygons represented at these scales are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site specific. The hydraulic conductivity polygons that were digitized from a mylar map had a maximum root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.008 map inches (0.020 map centimeters) or 167.49 feet (51.05 meters) ground distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
