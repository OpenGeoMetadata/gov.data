Using traditional and cell-specific gene knock-out mice, researchers in LGP have discovered that STAT5 is essential for the development and function of several distinct cell types, including the mammary gland and liver. Current research is aimed towards an understanding the genetic and epigenetic logic that controls cell specific functions of the transcription factor STAT5 and histone methyltransferases in mammary tissue and liver. LGP scientists have discovered that cytokine-STAT5 signaling is essential for the establishment of mammary alveolar progenitor cells (Yamaji et al., 2009). Using large scale genomic and genome-wide transcription factor binding and gene expression profiling LGP scientists continue to explore the chromatin landscape of mammary stem and cells throughout mammary development (Yamaji et al., 2012). These studies will provide insight into mechanisms used by STAT5 to control lineage decision-making, cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have also identified micro RNAs that are controlled during mammary development by STAT5. Mouse genetics and primary cell culture systems are being employed to further uncover physiological roles of these microRNAs "
