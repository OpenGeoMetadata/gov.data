    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The new generation of, high performance electric propulsion missions will require high mass throughput and most likely the use of grided ion thruster equipped with carbon based grids will be required to meet the extremely high life requirements.  However, because of the high susceptibility of these carbon based grids to damage during recycle event they will require a low stored energy beam power DC-DC converter.   An innovative three-phase resonant DC converter, which produces high levels of DC beam power with minimal stored energy is proposed.  This new design combines proven industrial technologies with a innovative new design that relies on combined outputs of phase-shifted converters to produce a low ripple DC voltage without output filtering. It is anticipated that stored energy can be reduced by two orders of magnitude when compared to the ?present state of the art? converters.  Additionally, the resonant power conversion topology facilitates both higher switching frequencies and power densities, which in turn lowers power module mass.  Once complete, these new DC-DC converters will significantly increase the current state of the art by reducing both the stored output energy and mass of the beam DC-DC converter.  These changes will enable the present state of the art carbon based grids to obtain the required life for high performance deep space missions. ",
