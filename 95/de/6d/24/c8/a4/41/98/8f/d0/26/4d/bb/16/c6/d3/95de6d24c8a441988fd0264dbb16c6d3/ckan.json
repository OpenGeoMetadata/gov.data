    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Thin film Metal RubberTM sensor appliqus have the potential to reduce\nthe time, complexity and cost of measuring air flow-induced skin\nfriction during the development of rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft\nand related systems.  Metal Rubber&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n skin friction sensor appliqus allow near real-time detection 2D mapping\nof air flow conditions over surfaces of air vehicles.  This is important\nfor analysis of laminar to turbulent flow transitions, flow separation\nand reattachment mechanisms, and other instabilities, during rotor blade\nand fuselage design, blade tracking adjustments, and active flight\ncontrol.  The sensors act as mechano-electrical transducers to convert\nair flow-induced tangential surface forces into electrical output\nsignals.  They are thin and surface-mounted so cause minimal interaction\nwith the flow, are easy to apply as an appliqu, and require no cavities\nor recesses other than holes to connect the sensor leads to data\nacquisition wiring.  The material is resistant to normal aircraft fluids\nand solvents, can operate over a temperature range of -65 to +150C, and\nis capable of withstanding moderate rain and dust erosion.   During\nPhase II, NanoSonic will  Develop an improved understanding of the\noperation of thin film Metal RubberTM skin friction sensors,\nStandardize sensor design and sensor fabrication processes,  Develop a\nmethod to calibrate sensor elements as part of manufacturing,  Develop a\nmeans to compensate for cross-sensitivity effects,  Develop and optimize\nmeans for data acquisition,  Use developed sensors in cooperation with\nthe NASA LaRC Subsonic Rotary Wing program to investigate rotorcraft\nresearch and development problems, and  Use and demonstrate the sensors\nin cooperation industry and academic colleagues. The significance of the\nproposed NASA Phase II SBIR program is in transitioning these sensors\nfrom analytical and FEM modeling to commercial products for experimental\nuse by NASA and industry.",
