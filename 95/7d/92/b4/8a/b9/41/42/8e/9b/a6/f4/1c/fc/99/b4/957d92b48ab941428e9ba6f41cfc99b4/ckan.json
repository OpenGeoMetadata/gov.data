    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The JPL web page devoted to looking for life on Mars has two images.  The first is an image of a hydrothermal pool at Yellowstone: the kind of place life might begin.  The second is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the Allen Hills 84001 meteorite.  This SEM picture is famous for capturing our imaginations when, in 1996, it was thought to show the first pictures of extraterrestrial life.  Whether these SEM images represent Martian life forms or something else, they stirred intense scientific research and vigorous debate within the astrobiology community, and increased public interest in the search for life on Mars.  When extraterrestrial life is conclusively discovered, it will most likely be shown to the world using an image from an electron microscope.\r\n\r\nWhy have no electron microscopes flown on planetary missions?  Because existing SEM's are too large, heavy and fragile to withstand spaceflight. The key to reducing the size and weight of a SEM lies in eliminating the high-vacuum pumping system. In the SEM, every time a new sample is introduced the system must be re-evacuated.  The entire pumping system must travel with the SEM.  This pumping system is heavy, fragile and consumes a lot of power.  It is because of the pumping system that no portable SEM exists, much less one that could travel to Mars.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we will eliminate the need for a high-vacuum system in a SEM.  This is accomplished by developing a new electron source that can operate in relatively poor vacuum conditions.  By eliminating the largest, most complex and heavy part of the SEM, this project will develop a truly portable SEM: the Backpack SEM.",
