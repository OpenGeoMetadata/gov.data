  "notes": "The application of reverse osmosis and ion exchange water treatment of groundwater to meet the growing potable water demand in eastern North Carolina has prompted interest in the potential environmental impacts of these unique water treatment processes. These processes generate a reject water comprised of concentrated salts, metals, and other constituents and major ion toxicity is an important concern in other states where these drinking water production technologies are more prevalent. Effluent and receiving stream samples were collected at three ion exchange and two reverse osmosis membrane water treatment plants (WTP) in North Carolina. Routine water quality characteristics, ion, nutrient and metal concentrations were documented in 15 effluent and 30 receiving stream samples between 2004 and 2005. Facility and process-specific differences in water quality characteristics of effluents collected from the ion exchange WTPs were apparent. Effluent ion concentrations were typically highest during the sodium regeneration cycle followed by the final rinse and backwash cycles of the ion exchange treatment process. Total residual chlorine concentrations in effluent from one ion exchange facility exceeded the state standard (of 17 Âµg/L) by 8- to 36-fold. Effluent characteristics differed substantially between the two reverse osmosis WTPs (likely due to source water chemistry); however, effluent samples from each facility were relatively uniform in chemical composition between sampling events. To determine the significance of ion imbalance toxicity associated with process effluents, 15 chronic baseline whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests were conducted using Ceriodaphnia dubia (water flea) and Americamysis bahia (opossum shrimp) in freshwater and saltwater exposures, respectively. Only one effluent sample was not acutely or chronically toxic to test organisms during the baseline WET tests. The toxicity of ion exchange effluents varied based on the treatment cycle with sodium regeneration samples being most toxic at all three facilities (and rinse and backwash cycles generally associated with lower toxicity). Subsequent toxicity tests using whole effluent and synthetic effluent test mixtures were performed to identify the potential for major ion imbalance as a source of toxicity in the baseline tests. Of the 14 effluent samples where subsequent tests were conducted, results indicated that sublethal toxicity in only one sample appeared to be related to a constituent other than the major ions; the results of testing with another sample were inconclusive due to elevated control mortality. Bioassessment of benthic community structure was also conducted to determine potential aquatic community structure impacts in the vicinity of the WTPs. Quantitative assessment could only be performed in the receiving stream (Filbert Creek) for two ion exchange facilities. Although an ion gradient (potentially related to hypersaline effluent releases or wind/tidal influence) was present in Filbert Creek, increasing taxa richness and decreasing biotic index values were found along this gradient suggesting that ion concentrations present have not uniquely stressed benthic communities. At the remaining three WTP sites, qualitative assessment indicates the presence of limited benthic communities (dominated by species tolerant of low-flow and low-oxygen conditions). Study results provide sufficient evidence that ion concentrations in reverse osmosis and ion exchange water treatment plant effluents are a primary source of the effluent toxicity. Proposed management recommendations focus on more closely matching effluent and receiving stream ion characteristics at existing and proposed WTPs by either diluting effluents prior to discharge (in freshwater environments) and maximizing instream dilution through outfall design and placement.",
