  "notes": "The Great Basin White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) population is listed under category 2 of the Endangered Species Act because of its dependence on closed, isolated, an intermittently available palusterine wetland communities of the high desert. Localized fluctuations in water regime and deterioration of breeding habitat may significantly alter regional population levels. Management of Great Basin Wetland communities for a sustained, viable White-faced Ibis population is not yet attainable because information on breeding habitat and reproductive success is insufficient, My main objectives for the 1996 season were to examine reproductive success, quantify breeding habitat characteristics and determine important nest and colony site selection factors, and investigate dispersal and migration patterns for White-faced Ibis in the Carson River Basin, Nevada. A total of 6,572 nesting White-faced Ibis pairs were counted in northwest Nevada. The number of nesting pairs in the Carson River Basin increased 49% from 1995's estimate of 2,872 to 4,925 in 1996. This growth may be correlated with increased water supply and available nesting habitat at Carson Lake. Also, the high number of nesting pairs in northwest Nevada may be indicative of a recent region- wide trend for the Great Basin White-faced Ibis population. Mayfield nest success (56.40%), mean hatching success (2.13 n-347 nests), mean fledging success (1.53 n=347), and the mean and mode clutch size (3.17, 3 n=362) for 8 monitored colonies in northwest Nevada were lower than in 1995 (76.0% n^ 6 colonies; 2.21 n^265; 2. n=264; 3.54, 4 n^293 nests). Low reproductive success in NUTG-S and NUTG colonies were due to a combination of poor nesting platform material (newly established Scirpus maritimus} and mink (Mustela vision) depredation. Low reproductive success in BIWA colony may have resulted from exposure to extreme cold and wet weather conditions. I measured water and vegetation variables at nest-site, colony-site, and marsh scales in 3 monitored colonies: SPUN, BIWA, and NUTG. Colony-site selection seemed to be related to the age and physiognomy of emergent vegetation within each respective marsh. Ibis at SPUN preferred a colony-site with low residual and high live percent cover of emergent vegetation,  Habitat Selection and Reproductive Success of White-Faced Ibis in northwest Nevada, 1996 whereas ibis at BIWA preferred high residual and low live percent cover. In contrast, ibis at NUTG preferred a colony-site with both high residual and live percent cover of emergent vegetation. This variability may reflect a preference for stability (for nesting) and accessibility (for breeding displays), given specific habitat limitations imposed on the ibis within each marsh. When a choice was available, ibis preferred a higher (SPUN) or lower water depth (NUTG) for colony-site placement. I believe this is an indirect result of selection for specific densities of residual and live vegetation within each colony. Water depth was positively correlated with the percentage of open water (Spearman Rank, R= 0.30, P  0.01 for HL, n= 90). A preference for higher percent coverage of residual vegetation (SPUN and NUTG), live vegetation (NUTG and BIWA), a lower water depth (SPUN and NUTG), and a lower percent cover of open water (SPUN and NUTG) indicates that ibis placed nest-sites in a higher density of vegetation within the colony-site. These results suggest that, within the colony, stability is an influential factor in nest-site selection.",
