    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "As part of an effort to monitor electricity usage by plug loads in a new high performance office building, plug load management devices were deployed to enable data collection, analysis, and active control of plug loads. We used a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) plug load management system to capture relevant data for two different types of multi-function devices (MFDs) in the facility, one of which was tested for use with different power settings. This enabled a quantitative analysis to assess impacts on energy consumption. It was found that a projected 65% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by using a newer, Energy Star compliant model of MFD, and an additional projected 39% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by subsequently changing the time-to-sleep for that MFD. It was also found that it may be beneficial to apply automated analysis with anomaly detection algorithms to detect problems with MFD performance, such as a failure to go to sleep mode or variations in sleep power draw. Furthermore, we observed that energy savings realized by using plug load management devices to de-energize (unplug) MFDs during non-business hours depends on the sleep power draw and time-to-sleep setting. For the MFDs in this study with settings established per the maintenance contract (which were different than factory default values), turning the device off at night and then on in the morning used more energy than leaving it on in sleep mode due to the start-up behavior and excessive time-to-sleep setting of four hours. From this and other assessments, we offer these recommendations to building occupants: reduce MFD time-to-sleep, encourage employees to use the power save button, and apply automated analysis to detect problems with device performance.",
