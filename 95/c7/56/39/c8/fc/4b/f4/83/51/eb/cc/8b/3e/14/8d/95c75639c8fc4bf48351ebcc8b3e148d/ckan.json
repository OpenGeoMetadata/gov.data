    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Electronics packaging is a complex technology development issue that requires coordinated optimized solutions at the component (chip), subsystem (board) and system (spacecraft/instrument) levels.&amp;nbsp; The proposed effort will develop intelligent structural-thermal capabilities embedded into a multi-functional structure.&amp;nbsp; Embedded electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thermal control subsystem will enable lighter, more compact packaging capable of greater heat transport than the current state of the art (conduction and radiation).&amp;nbsp; Future spacecraft electronics subsystems may contain electronics components directly integrated into the board at a greater component density (more components) than currently possible due to thermal constraints. This structure will ultimately reduce the number of boards required (mass and volume savings). Furthermore, convective, two-phase embedded thermal control subsystems significantly reduce the overall thermal resistance and will allow remote heat rejection at higher temperatures than those currently attained by electronics thermal control packages.&amp;nbsp; The spacecraft realizes significant mass and volume savings with smaller, more effective radiators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing techniques are advanced manufacturing processes that build up a structure or device layer by layer.&amp;nbsp; Additive manufacturing processes have not yet been applied to multifunctional structure applications.&amp;nbsp; The self-sensing thermal/strain system will require a material with homogenous electrical and thermal properties as temperature and strain will be measured using resistivity.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the thermal subsystem will require small channel hydraulic diameters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Each of these subsystems will be directly integrated at the &amp;lsquo;layer&amp;rsquo; level determined to provide for optimal structural and thermal performance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Thus, candidate materials include both metals and nano-enhanced polymers whose properties can be engineered to meet project requirements. These requirements are ideal for multifunctional structures: strict manufacturing tolerances, small-scale features, and advanced materials.&amp;nbsp; The investigation at hand will advance additive manufacturing techniques and processes by combining self-sensing (temperature-stress/strain), complex embedded thermal hardware (EHD electrodes), structural capabilities, wiring board and grounding plane into a single, homogenous device.&lt;/p&gt;",
