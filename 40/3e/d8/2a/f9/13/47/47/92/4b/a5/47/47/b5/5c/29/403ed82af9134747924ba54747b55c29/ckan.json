    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The use of truly autonomous vehicles (UV) has been hampered by a lack of sophisticated and resource efficient obstacle avoidance systems.  Current approaches have focused on either expensive active sensor systems or inferential processing techniques that are computationally intensive.  In this proposal, UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) presents a layered, intelligent and adaptive system concept that will facilitate true UV autonomous operations by solving the collision avoidance problem using inexpensive imaging sensors and modest computational resources.\r\nUtopiaCompression proposes focused research to push the limits of automation in the 3D arena by providing a real-time, end-to-end solution tailored to NASA's sensor data and mission requirements.  This would be accomplished by deriving and using 3D structures obtained from inexpensive sensors to compute and model a spatio-temporal vector field. UC's novel, iterative refinement, multi-resolution registration algorithms enable the inexpensive and efficient generation of the 3D structures. These methods would be integrated into navigation strategies utilized to command UVs for safe cruising (avoiding collision) through cluttered environments.\r\n",
