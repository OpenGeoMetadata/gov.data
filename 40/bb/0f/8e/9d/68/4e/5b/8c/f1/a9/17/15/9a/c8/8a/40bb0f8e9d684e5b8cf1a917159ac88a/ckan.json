The data was released continent by continent, as and when the data was processed by NASA and the USGS. For the United States, data was made available at 1-arc second resolution (approximately 30m at the equator), but for the rest of the world the 1-arc second product is degraded to 3-arc seconds (approximately 90m at the equator). SRTM elevation data has now been released for the entire terrestrial surface, and a Finished product has now been released.",
