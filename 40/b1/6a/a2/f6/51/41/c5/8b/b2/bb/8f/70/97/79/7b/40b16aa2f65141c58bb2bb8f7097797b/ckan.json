  "notes": "The Potomac River estuary, the second largest tributary to Chesapeake Bay, is an important nursery and spawning area for both migratory and resident fish species of commercial and recreational importance. The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential for endocrine disrupting effects on fish collected from this watershed. The study sites were located downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant for the District of Columbia and in the Anacostia River, a tidal tributary. These sites were selected because they were located in an urbanized area, near multiple sources of endocrine disrupting compounds. The reference site was located on the tidal Patuxent River adjacent to the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary. We measured vitellogenin (Vtg) production and gonadal histopathology in field collected male common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from these sites as indicators of exposure and response to estrogenic compounds. Vtg was found at detectable levels in 100% (16 of 16) of the male carp from all sites. Vtg concentrations were all less than those measured in females, and ranged from 0.001 mg/ml (the detection limit) in the Potomac River to 0.058 mg/ml measured in an Anacostia carp. There were no statistical differences in the mean Vtg concentrations in male carp collected from the two potentially impacted sites and the reference site; however, Vtg levels in fish from all three sites appear to be above normal concentrations based on a comparison to data from several hundred carp collected in the Mississippi River Basin. The measurement of detectable levels of Vtg in all male carp collected suggests there may be widespread low level exposure of fish populations to endocrine disrupting compounds in the Potomac River. Histopathological analyses did not indicate corresponding effects on reproduction; however the sample size is limited. The finding of elevated Vtg in male carp from the reference site is somewhat surprising and may be related to exposure to agricultural chemicals, several of which are presumed endocrine disrupters. We recommend additional study including sampling a larger number of fish and the histopathological evaluation of both females and males at all sites.",
