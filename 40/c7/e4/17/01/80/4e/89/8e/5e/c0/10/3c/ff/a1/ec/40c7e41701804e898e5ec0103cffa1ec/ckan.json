    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify and estimate the cost of one or more approaches of utilizing waste hydrogen for power generation. To simplify the scope of the problem, this study was limited to the boiloff source of the run tank at one test stand which consistently produces 500 gallons of hydrogen gas every day. This study used the results of several previous studies that also examined different ways of allaying the waste hydrogen problem. Using literature from these previous efforts as a starting point, a market review was conducted to find potential systems of hydrogen-fueled energy generation that are currently available. Candidate systems were considered based upon their compatibility with requirements dictated by the test stand and related infrastructure. These requirements were developed from technical data and drawings and supplemented with knowledge gained during a site visit to the test stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market review revealed only a single viable option: a hydrogen-fueled 4.9-L reciprocating engine and generator set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-level design of the supporting infrastructure was carried out in order to conduct a reasonably accurate cost analysis once a prime mover and generator system was selected. Gas and water piping systems were developed, electrical equipment needs were identified, and a general site layout determined. Cost estimates were then made for materials, equipment, installation labor, maintenance and prime contractor expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the performance of the power generation system, capital and variable expenditures known, life cycle cost analysis metrics were calculated. Impacts of the developed system on the environment were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;",
