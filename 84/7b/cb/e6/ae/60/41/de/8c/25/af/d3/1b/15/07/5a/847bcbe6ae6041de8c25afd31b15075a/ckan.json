The orthophotos are 0.5-meter ground sample distance (GSD) and are in UTM Zone 15, NAD83 (meters). The tiling format of the imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 150 meter buffer on all four sides. This metadata record was created by MnGeo using information supplied by DNR and Surdex Corporation.",
