    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains monthly average snow-free surface shortwave albedo calculated for the period 1982-1998 and estimates of background soil/litter reflectances in the visible (0.4-0.7 mm) and near-infrared (NIR) (0.7-1.0 mm) wavelengths. Biophysical Parameters derived from the FASIR-NDVI (Fourier Adjusted, Solar zenith angle correction, Interpolation, and Reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data set developed for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection for the months of January 1982 through December 1998 were used to calculate monthly mean surface albedos at 1 X 1 degree spatial resolution for vegetated land surfaces (Sellers et al, 1996b) for the wavelength interval from 0.4 to 3.0 mm. The instantaneous albedo is a function of the properties of the land surface and the solar zenith angle. The monthly mean albedo is an average weighted over time weighted by the incident radiation. NDVI data are used to generate the biophysical parameters leaf area index (LAI) and green fraction of vegetation (Greenness) used by the canopy radiative transfer model of the Simple Biosphere (SiB2) model (Sellers et al, 1996a), which computes the instantaneous albedo. This is coupled to the Colorado State University (CSU) General Circulation Model (GCM) (Randall et al, 1989) which integrates the SiB2 radiative transfer through time. The incident radiation for weighting the time-averaged albedo was provided by a previous run of the GCM using the atmospheric radiation parameterization of Harshvardhan et al (1987). The Harshvardhan parameterization models radiative transfer through the atmosphere in both the longwave and shortwave bands, including the effects of cloudiness and water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone. The shortwave radiation distinguishes between the direct and diffuse components of the solar beam.",
