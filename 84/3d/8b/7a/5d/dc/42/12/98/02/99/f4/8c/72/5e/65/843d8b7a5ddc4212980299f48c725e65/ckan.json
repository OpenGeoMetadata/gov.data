  "notes": "The Rattlesnake Creek Partnership (Partnership) was formed over 18 years ago to cooperatively develop and implement solutions to water resource problems within the subbasin. Six years of negotiations resulted in the Partnership’s adoption of the jointly developed Rattlesnake Creek Management Program (Program) in 2000. Considerable time and resources have been expended on data gathering, monitoring, and hydrologic modeling. The subbasin’s variable hydrology, characterized by sequences of dry years with low streamflow and over-drafting on groundwater storage, and then wet periods with high streamflow and recharge, provides both challenges and opportunities in defining problems and addressing them. Through their participation in the work of the Partnership, each of the partners has increased their understanding of the area’s water resource issues. The record shows declines in groundwater levels in the western portion of the subbasin and a downward trend in streamflow in the central and eastern portion of the subbasin. Since the Program began in 2000, limited reduction in water use has been realized through participation in incentive-based programs and enhanced compliance and enforcement, but the annual water savings claimed thus far is far less than the goal of 27,346 acre-feet of savings laid out by the Partnership in the Program. At the end of the 12-year implementation period the Partnership finds that the Program has been successful in part and unsuccessful in part when considered against its originally stated purpose, goals, and objectives to address streamflow depletions and declines in groundwater levels. The program was not designed to address the individual interests of the partners, but to address the status of the overall basin. This report consists of a summary of the data which was compiled and analyzed to review the performance of the Program, and in separate statements, the findings of each partner organization on the status of the Program as of the end of this third and final 4-year implementation period.",
