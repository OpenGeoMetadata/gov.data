    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose a hollow reservoir cathode to improve performance in ion and Hall thrusters.  We will adapt our existing reservoir cathode technology to this purpose.  Reservoir cathodes are the only emission sources that are capable of supplying the necessary current density (&gt;5.0 A/cm2) and life (&gt;100,000 hours) for next generation high-power thrusters.  More powerful thrusters are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth escape and near-earth space maneuvers.  Reservoir cathodes are able to sustain high rates of barium diffusion to the cathode surface to overcome the high rate of barium removal in ion engines. The key Phase I innovation was flexible supports for the cathode matrix.  This prevented the matrix fractures and reservoir leaks of previous reservoir cathodes for ion engines.  Cathode operation and stability was verified.  In Phase II,the design is refined and tested in actual ion engines.\r\n \r\nThe key challenge is the stresses exerted on the cathode tube and reservoir due to differential expansion and large temperature excursions.  These originate from the outside heater and also from heating due to collisions with the cathode.  These stresses can lead to fractures and weld failure.  Our innovation solves this problem.  This was proven on the Phase I device.\r\n\r\nIn Phase II we further test and optimize the Phase I device and perform life testing on it.  We build cathode assemblies for insertion into ion engines which we test in an ion environment at e beam, JPL and Colorado State University.  Their maximum specific impulse will be measured.",
