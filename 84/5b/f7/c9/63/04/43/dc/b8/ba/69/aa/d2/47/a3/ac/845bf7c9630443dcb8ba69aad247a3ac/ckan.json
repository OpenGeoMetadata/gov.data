  "notes": "The Weather Station Fire (July, 2005) burned across 4,918 acres in the Saddle Mountain Unit of the Hanford Reach National Monument, which included parts of the Priest Rapids Bar and Vernita Basin. Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) treatments undertaken the following winter were aerial seeding the entire area with a variety of native species and drill-seeding and planting shrub starts in selected sites. In addition to the seeding and planting treatments, the entire burned area was treated with an aerial application of Roundup PRO© (4 fl. Oz. /acre) with the goal of controlling cheatgrass long enough to enhance establishment of the seeded/planted species. Much of the area was extremely vulnerable to wind erosion, particularly areas that hadn’t burned in recent years and that had captured abundant loess. Windblown sediments caused ‘brown-outs’ on occasion after the fire. One particularly susceptible area directly upwind from State Highway 24 was aerially hydro-mulched in an attempt to stabilize it.The dynamics of the post-fire vegetation and effectiveness of the BAER treatments was monitored for the first two growing seasons after the fire, during which quantitative and qualitative assessments were made of the treatment success (Easterly and Salstrom 2009). The assessments included revisiting existing vegetation plots (established in support of Ernst and Holmes 2012) and using the fine-scale vegetation map that had been created using both remote imagery and extensive field reconnaissance (Easterly and Salstrom 2004). In addition, a library of photo points that was created during the mapping project, together with some photos available from the previous plot work (Ernest and Holmes 2012), helped document pre- and post-fire vegetation trends from which to assess the effects of the BAER treatments. Results of that initial monitoring effort were reported in Easterly and Salstrom (2009).Since the vegetation was clearly still in flux after the initial monitoring project, additional monitoring was undertaken in 2012 to better assess the longer-term effects of rehabilitation treatment on the vegetative structure within the burned area. The results of that monitoring effort are the subject of this report. In addition, rare plant occurrences located on and near the fire were revisited.",
