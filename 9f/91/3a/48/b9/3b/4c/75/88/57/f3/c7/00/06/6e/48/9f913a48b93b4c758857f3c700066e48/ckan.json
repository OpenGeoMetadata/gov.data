    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Phoenix Integration's vision is the creation of an intuitive human-in-the-loop  engineering environment called Decision Navigator that leverages recent advances in multi-dimensional visualization technology, state-of-the art optimization algorithms, and parallel processing capability. The visualization displays help designers understand key trends and trade-offs, follow the progress of the optimization algorithm, and interact with and guide the algorithm so as to make decisions regarding promising designs. This tool is fundamentally different from traditional optimization tools because of its interactive nature. Phase I research proved the feasibility of the Decision Navigator concept by integrating an optimization engine with multi-dimensional visualization tools and then integrating the combination into the Phoenix Integration design environment known as ModelCenter. This Phase II proposal builds upon the Phase I proof of feasibility study and completes the concept as a practical commercial decision support tool. Key technical elements added in Phase II include the ability to collaborate with other users, the ability to manage risk and uncertainty, and interactive \"wizards\" that will help users accomplish common tasks. The Decision Navigator will be a critical link in exercising NASA mission models, trade studies, system and investment analysis, and program and technology planning.",
