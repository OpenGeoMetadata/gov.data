  "notes": "This set of GeoTIFF and EPPL7 files represents the Minnesota Department of Transportation's County Highway Map Series in georeferenced image formats. These images of the standard Mn/DOT County Highway Map product can be used in GIS systems and overlayed with other GIS information. The origin of this data is Mn/DOT's Microstation CAD system, where all linework, feature type coding, and symbolization is stored and updated. To produce these data sets, Mn/DOT exported the data from Microstation into postscript files. LMIC then imported the data into GIS systems for georeferencing and further processing. The GeoTIFF data are distributed in both County Highway Map map sheet and full county extents; EPPL7 data sets are distributed only as full county files. Map collars have been removed. This data set represents the Mn/DOT County Highway Map as of January 1, 2002.",
