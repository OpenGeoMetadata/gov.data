  "notes": "The USGS and the NGA have collaborated on the development of a notably enhanced global elevation model named the GMTED2010 that replaces GTOPO30 as the elevation dataset of choice for global and continental scale applications. The new model has been generated at three separate resolutions (horizontal post spacing) of 30 arc-seconds (about 1 kilometer), 15 arc-seconds (about 500 meters), and 7.5 arc-seconds (about 250 meters). This new product suite provides global coverage of all land areas from latitude 84 degrees N to 56 degrees S for most products, and coverage from 84 degrees N to 90 degrees S for several products. Some areas, namely Greenland and Antarctica, do not have data available at the 15- and 7.5-arc-second resolutions because the input source data do not support that level of detail. An additional advantage of the new multi-resolution global model over GTOPO30 is that seven new raster elevation products are available at each resolution. The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis. The systematic subsample product is defined using a nearest neighbor resampling function, whereby an actual elevation value is extracted from the input source at the center of a processing window. Most vertical heights in GMTED2010 are referenced to the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM 96) geoid (NGA, 2010). In addition to the elevation products, detailed spatially referenced metadata containing attribute fields such as coordinates, projection information, and raw source elevation statistics have been generated on a tile-by-tile basis for all the input datasets that constitute the global elevation model. GMTED2010 is based on data derived from 11 raster-based elevation sources.",
