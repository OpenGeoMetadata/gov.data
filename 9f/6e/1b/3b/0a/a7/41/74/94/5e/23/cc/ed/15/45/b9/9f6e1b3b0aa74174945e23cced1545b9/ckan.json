  "notes": "Several investigators working on the food habits of the black duck (Anas rubripes), have reported the presence of soft clams (Mya arenaria), in their stomachs and necks. The extent of this feeding and its relation to the clam population is the purpose of the present investigation. At the request of the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this detail was started October 24, 1946, on the clam flats located within the Plum Island section of the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, Essex County, Massachusetts. The investigation continued on the flats until December 10. Further examination of samples taken from the clam flats and duck stomachs before December 10 was continued at the field station of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Annapolis, Maryland, during the early part of 1947. The investigation was planned for this time to include in the observations any changes in the black duck population occurring during the Fall migrations or from the disturbances attributed to the hunting season that opened on October 26, 1946. The migration was well underway when this study was inaugurated and only minor changes in the population were noticed during the period of these observations. The black duck population of the area was estimated by various ornithologists and confirmed by Mr. Charles E Addy of the Fish and Wildlife Service as about 2,000 in September increasing during the Fall to about 4,000 in October and November when the black duck migration was in full swing.",
