    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries do not fully meet the energy density, power density and safety requirements specified by NASA for future exploration missions. Building upon our Phase I feasibility study, we propose to implement an advanced cathode material in practical Li-ion batteries. The cathode material offers superior electrochemical performance over its commercially used counterpart, particularly in terms of discharge capacity and energy density. In Phase I, working in collaboration with a leading university-based researcher, we demonstrated that intrinsic modifications in the crystal structure, and extrinsic modifications on the surface of cathode particles, can lead to energy densities greater than 1150 Wh/kg at room temperature and 800 Wh/kg at zero degrees C for the cathode powder. In the Phase II program, we intend to combine the intrinsic and extrinsic effects in the cathode material, which will deliver the needed energy density at low temperatures, along with other desirable attributes. This will represent a significant advancement of the state-of-the-art in cathode materials. The structural and morphological modifications introduced in the material will allow us to (i) maintain high energy and power density at low temperature (ii) lower the irreversible capacity loss and improve the efficiency, and (iii) further stabilize and enhance the safety of the cell. In Phase II, our university-based collaborator will fabricate and test small Li-ion pouch cells, which will help optimize the cathode material. In addition, prototype Li-ion cells with a capacity of ~ 5Ah will be fabricated and tested by a large Li-ion battery manufacturer and supplier to the aerospace industry. Further, a NASA prime contractor has offered to guide the Phase II program. The outcome of a successful Phase II program will be the demonstration of an advanced and robust energy storage system that can be used for future NASA applications.  ",
