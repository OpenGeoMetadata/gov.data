    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Future spacecraft will require services offering higher data rates than those supported today and with improved SWAP and performance.  Complicating the environment in which these technologies operate is the shortage of available and interference free radio spectrum.  While the incremental advances in equipment design and performance in X, Ka bands requested in this topic may meet some of these future needs, MaXentric believes that developing equipment to provide high bandwidth communication services in as yet underutilized spectrum, namely the Inter-Satellite band 59-71 GHz, offers a higher return on investment and a more significant capability enhancement. The recent rapid commercialization of the E and V Bands (71-76, 81-86 and 60GHz) for terrestrial use  has driven the development of a large, cost sensitive market place for RF components that didn't exist even a few years ago. In this proposal MaXentric suggests revisiting the utility of these frequencies for space based high data rate communications by developing and demonstrating a high data rate transceiver for the range 59-71 GHz. As a Phase 1 and 2 participant  in Darpa's Fractionated Satellite (\"F6\", 60GHz, 1Gbps) , Mobile Hotspot UAV (\"MHS\", E Band, 1Gbps) and Microscale Power Conversion (\"MPC\") programs, MaXentric is in a unique position to design, develop and demonstrate a small, low SWAP, high data rate, power efficient,  59-71 GHz transceiver  that could be incorporated into NASA's SCaN Integrated Network Architecture in the future. This capability would not be restricted by availability of spectrum and has other inherent advantages because the attenuation of Earth's atmosphere reduces interference and associated coordination requirements. MaXentric believes the availability of almost 12 GHz of unrestricted communications bandwidth provides a very significant opportunity for the provision of high data rate services.",
