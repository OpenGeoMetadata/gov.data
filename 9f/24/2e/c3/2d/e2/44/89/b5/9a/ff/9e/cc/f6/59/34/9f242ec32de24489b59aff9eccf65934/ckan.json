    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "XC Associates proposes to build on prior work to develop and\ncharacterize a very high efficiency, lightweight radiator constructed\nfrom high thermal conductivity carbon fibers.  The radiator will be\nsuitable for use on instruments carried by future spacecraft.  The phase\nI effort will address the thermal performance and size limitations of\nthe composite design. Since cryogenic applications are becoming more\ncommon the thermal characteristics of the radiator will be measured down\nto 45K. Modern spacecraft thermal control needs to be low mass and low\ncost. Composite thermal radiators will realize a greater than 60&amp;#37; weight\nsaving compared to aluminum and the costs can be addressed by the use of\nstandard technology that can be easily applied to new designs. The major\ninnovation to be demonstrated by this project is the use of highly\norientated fibers that completely eliminates the low through thickness\nthermal conductivity normally associated with traditional carbon fiber\nlaminates. This highly oriented lay-up also allows the thickness of the\nradiator to be tapered down to less than 0.020&amp;quot; while retaining\nvery high stiffness.  Therefore, the radiator is much thinner than the\nequivalent aluminum radiator, which combined with lower density of\ncomposite construction, accounts for the significant weight reduction.",
