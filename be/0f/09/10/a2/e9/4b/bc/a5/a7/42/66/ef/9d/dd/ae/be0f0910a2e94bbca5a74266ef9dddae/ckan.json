  "notes": "This project contains a collection of restoration site histories for the cleanup restoration at Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge.  This project contains a collection of site histories for the cleanup restoration at Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge RMANWR.  Each Site History contains a synopsis of all the other information a person would need to know about the projectname, location, soils, seed mixes, size, range management data veg success, and why the project was initiated. The Site Histories were intended as concise summaries of work completed on a specific restoration project.  The Site Histories were created and designed for: A.  A legacy record of how millions of dollars of public monies were spent on restoration at RMANWR. B.  To serve as a dynamic land management tool, whereby Refuge managers have the opportunity to see active management progressing on the ground by being able to instantly access on the S: drive to find current narratives, descriptions, and photos of fieldwork being completed, fieldwork having recently been completed, or current site conditions. C.  Before Site Histories, there was no single place to find out what work had been accomplished on a restoration project without having to go through multiple years of accomplishment reports and Field Notes.  Now it is all together.  Anything done that we know of or documented to complete a specific project is now in one place for that project.  D.  Site Histories will provide future land managers with a record of what cultural practices were best to produce successful results, and will show the typical field practices employed and the time of year when they were used.  The RMANWR Site Histories may in fact be the most comprehensive record of intensive prairie restoration ever compiled anywhere and will likely have a benefit to other restoration programs and other Refuges anywhere in the United States.  The Site Histories incorporate fieldwork commencing from the early 1980s to the present, in addition to an estimated 15,000 sitespecific photographs.  Photographs for site histories are located at Rocky Mountain Arsenal and are organized within folders for each site history.",
