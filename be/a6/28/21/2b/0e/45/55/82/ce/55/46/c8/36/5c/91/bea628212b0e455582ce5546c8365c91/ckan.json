The seasons were defined as the following: 1) Fall= September, October, November; 2) Winter= December, January, February; 3) Spring= March, April, May; 4) Summer= June, July, August. For example, June '98, July '98, August '98 = Turbidity Summer '98.These images were also reprocessed to remove land and no data values (value = 252 and value = 0, 253, 251 respectively), as well as to calculate the real world values for turbidity in inverse steradians.",
