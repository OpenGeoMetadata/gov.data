  "notes": "This data layer provides access to Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites as part of the CIMC web service. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, among other things, helps ensure that wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner so as to protect human health and the environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal. In particular RCRA tightly regulates all hazardous waste from \"cradle to grave.\" In general, all generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous waste are required to provide information about their activities to state environmental agencies. These agencies, in turn pass on the information to regional and national EPA offices. Accidents or other activities at facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes have sometimes led to the release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into soil, ground water, surface water, or air. When that happens, the RCRA Corrective Action program is one program that may be used to accomplish the necessary cleanup. This data layer shows those RCRA sites that are located at BRAC Federal Facilities. Additional RCRA sites and other BRAC sites (those that are not RCRA sites) are included in other data layers as part of this web service. Note: RCRA facilities which are not undergoing corrective action are not considered “Cleanups” in Cleanups in My Community. The complete set of RCRA facilities can be accessed via the EPA RCRA database in Envirofacts (https://www.epa.gov/enviro/rcrainfo-overview). The CIMC web service was initially published in 2013, but the data are updated on the 18th of each month. The full schedule for data updates in CIMC is located here: https://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/data_update_v2.",
