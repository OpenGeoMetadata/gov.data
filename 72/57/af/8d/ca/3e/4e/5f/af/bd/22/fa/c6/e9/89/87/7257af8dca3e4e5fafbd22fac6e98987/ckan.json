    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The purpose of this Phase I NASA SBIR program is to develop high\nperformance multifunctional nanostructured materials that can be used to\nfabricate icephobic multifunctional appliqus with enhanced erosion\nresistance for rotorcraft leading edges.  The proposed technology offers\nintegrated multifunctionality that results in reduction of weight,\nsystem complexity, maintenance, and cost over current systems.\nPrevention of ice buildup will facilitate mission critical operations in\nicing conditions, as well as mitigate concerns of vibration transmission\nand shudder that are associated with ice buildup.  Integration of\nadditional erosion resistant composites may also result in reduced\nmaintenance costs.   Electrothermal systems are currently used for\nanti-icing systems in rotorcraft, but are prone to failure due to system\ncomplexity.  To mitigate the problems associated with current anti-icing\nsystems, NanoSonic proposes to develop multifunctional adhesive backed\nappliqus with integrated hydrophobicity and enhanced erosion resistance.\nHigh performance tapes are currently applied to rotorcraft leading edges\nto help improve erosion resistance.  Integrating multiple\nfunctionalities into a high performance nanocomposite appliqu would\nresult in reduction of weight and system complexity, facilitate\noperation in icing conditions, and reduce maintenance on the\nrotorblades.  For minimal maintenance and application cost, a new\nappliqu can be readily placed on the rotorblade leading edge when the\nexisting appliqu has exhausted its functionality.",
