    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "High power electric propulsion systems have the potential to revolutionize space propulsion due to their extremely high performance.  This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.  Creating reliable valves that can operate in pulse mode for extremely long life and at low power are critical in these applications.\r\nWASK Engineering will develop a normally closed, piezo electric operated valve for application to pulsing electrical thrusters.  The benefits of such a valve includes 1) demonstrated ability to operate at frequencies from 0 Hz to 4,000 Hz, 2) ability to throttle continuously from 0-100&#37; open, 3) extremely fast response, 4) low power usage, 5) infinitely variable valve operating waveforms, sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, custom wave form, etc., 6) no EMI generated, 7) very small size provides options when locating valve, 8) demonstrated ability to operate at pressures exceeding 1,000 psi, and 9) very low part count for reliability.",
