    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains five NPP data files and three climate data files (ASCII .txt format). There is one NPP file for each of the five sub-types of upper montane tropical forest located along John Crow Ridge in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. Biomass, productivity, tree mortality, standing crop of litter, LAI, and nutrient content of leaf fall were measured from 1974 to 1978. Long-term climate data are available from Cinchona Botanic Gardens, approximately 3 km south of the John Crow Ridge study area and at similar elevation.The John Crow Ridge study areas (18.08 N 76.65 W) consist of 8 to 10 contiguous 10 m x 10 m permanent plots. The forests are of low stature and appear to be completely undisturbed. The forest floor at one sub-site (Mor Ridge) was overlain by a 30-50 cm layer of mor humus with a high C/N ratio.ANPP was estimated to be between 654-997 g/m2/year (sum of litterfall and trunk/branch increment), or 854-1,057 g/m2/year (including tree mortality). These figures are lower than for lowland tropical forests with greater leaf turnover and reflect the relatively low stature of the upper montane forest plots. Above-ground biomass was estimated by both destructive methods and nondestructive regression analysis. Values ranged from 23,000 to 34,000 g/m2. Below-ground biomass (5,370 g/m2) was determined for one site by harvesting roots to a depth of 50 cm. LAI for trees plus understory, where measured, was 5.5-5.7 m2/m2.",
