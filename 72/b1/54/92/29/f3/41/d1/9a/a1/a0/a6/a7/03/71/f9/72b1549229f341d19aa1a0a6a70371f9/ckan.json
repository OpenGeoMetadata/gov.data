    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The BEAM project advances inflatable habitat technology further and conducts flight demonstration of a commercially-designed inflatable system to achieve Technology Readiness Level 9.0.&amp;nbsp; The primary performance requirement is to demonstrate that the BEAM can successfully launch and deploy on the ISS, inflate, and maintain long-term pressure without leakage. The leak performance is defined as both short-term, immediately after deployment, and long-term, for the balance of the two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration will consist of the following critical technology objectives:&lt;br /&gt;a) Launch of a packed inflatable structure in a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) launch vehicle&lt;br /&gt;b) &amp;nbsp;Robotic berthing to ISS&lt;br /&gt;c) &amp;nbsp;Safe deployment (inflation) on ISS&lt;br /&gt;d) Promote passive air exchange with ISS and create an environment inside the BEAM for ISS crew to ingress on a temporary basis&lt;br /&gt;e) Measure deployment loads during inflation of the BEAM on ISS&lt;br /&gt;f) Determine radiation protection capability of an inflatable structure in low Earth orbit and demonstrate the performance of advanced active radiation sensors on ISS&lt;br /&gt;g) Long-term structural performance of inflatable shell after exposure to atomic oxygen, vacuum, radiation and thermal cycling&lt;br /&gt;h) Demonstrate performance of structural health monitoring systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;i) Measure long-term leak performance of inflatable bladder and bladder joints after launch and deployment cycle&lt;br /&gt;j) Develop structural and mechanical system requirements for a human-rated inflatable module in external orbital environment and successfully verify those requirements&lt;br /&gt;k) Develop crew restraints and mobility aids for IVA activities inside an inflatable module.&lt;br /&gt;l) Develop and implement &amp;quot;housekeeping&amp;quot; procedures for internal surfaces of an inflatable module.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, BEAM will demonstrate&amp;nbsp;jettisoning of a large inflatable structure from ISS during a contingency depress or at end of life (Note: Payloads on ISS are disposed with the returning Cargo vehicle at end of life. Robotic jettison of a large 3000 lbs structure at end of life has never been performed from ISS before and will be demonstrated with BEAM for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;",
