      "description": "The Anticorruption Projects Database (Database) includes information about USAID projects with anticorruption interventions implemented worldwide between 2007 and 2013. The Database includes about 300 long-term country projects and regional or short-term projects. Projects were identified and information collected by the six Implementing Partners (IP) of the ENGAGE Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Criteria for selecting projects included: distinctive project interventions targeted at reducing corruption or promoting government integrity, accountability and transparency that ultimately results in reducing opportunities to corruption.  Availability of sufficient information about the projects was another criterion for selecting them to the Database.  This included but was not limited to project description and results, implementation timeframe, project value, and implementer.  After reviewing approximately 2000 projects, more than 300 were identified for the Database.
