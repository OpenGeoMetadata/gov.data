    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tHigh-altitude balloon flights are an inexpensive method used to lift payloads to high altitudes. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations permit payloads of up to 6 lbs without requiring any waivers or special permissions. Using such a balloon flight capability, the Rocket University program at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has collaborated with the Johnson Space Center (JSC) to perform test flights of a sub-scale version of the Maraia Entry Capsule. The Maraia Capsule is envisioned as an entry technology testbed that could be adapted to return small payloads (10-100&amp;rsquo;s of kg) from the International Space Station (ISS) or from beyond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) destinations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe main test objective is to gain insight into the aerodynamic and dynamic properties of the capsule in the subsonic regime. The capsule has been scaled accordingly, resulting in a test article 10&amp;rdquo; in diameter by approximately 6.5&amp;rdquo; tall at the 6 lb weight limit. Secondary test objectives include testing subsystems (e.g. avionics, parachutes, and guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;amp;C) subsystems) planned for use in future larger scale flights, as well as training and gaining overall experience in all aspects of designing, developing, and testing spaceflight systems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; winds and trajectory predictions are used to determine a launch location such that the trajectory and predicted landing location is desirable for safety and recovery purposes. The balloon is filled on the ground and payload lines are laid along the predominant ground wind direction. The system is launched from a large open area in order to minimize the risk of entanglement and jerking of the lines and payloads.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe balloon ascends for one to two hours, depending on payload mass and fill volume. Once above an altitude of 70,000 ft, a release command is issued when trajectory predictions show that the capsule will land within the landing zone (or when they are closest to the zone, based on real-time trends). The capsule descends in freefall to 50,000 ft, at which point an autonomous command is sent to deploy the parachute. The ground operator may also manually issue a parachute deploy command at any time. The capsule then descends and lands, with an approximate terminal velocity of 38 ft/s.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tA separate release command is issued for the Rocket University payload, which contains its own avionics, when landing predictions are such that it is desirable for the payload to separate from the balloon and land. (Note: on Flight #1, this command was issued simultaneously for both payloads. Future flights will permit separate commands for better control of payload landing locations). The parachute system for the Rocket University payload is an inline, pre-deployed system that inflates as the payload descends. The balloon then ascends (now more quickly, with less payload attached) and bursts at (very approximately) 115,000 ft, and is not recovered.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe subscale Maraia Capsule includes avionics, a parachute deployment system, communications, power, a global positioning system (GPS) / inertial navigation system (INS) sensor, a GoPro camera, a flight processor, and a data recorder. A barometric altimeter is being added for Flight #2.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tA number of blog websites and YouTube videos have been posted on the web of other groups and individuals performing high-altitude balloon flights. However, NASA&amp;rsquo;s effort is unique because it is pushing the envelope on small high-altitude balloon flights in a few different ways. First, Rocket University has developed an avionics platform that will fly on large-scale balloon flights, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and rockets. Second, Rocket University&amp;rsquo;s approach of using telemetered and recorded GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), altimeter, and video data is much more advanced than the typical hobbyist&amp;rsquo;s approach of using a cell phone / camera combination tracked via the web. Additionally, this capsule uses a parachute deploy system originally modified from a typical rocketry system using black powder to one using a commanded servo/pin/spring combination, in order to reduce the hazard associated with explosives. Finally, this capsule is a prototype for a potential sample return capsule designed to bring back samples from the ISS, an asteroid, the Moon, or Mars.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
