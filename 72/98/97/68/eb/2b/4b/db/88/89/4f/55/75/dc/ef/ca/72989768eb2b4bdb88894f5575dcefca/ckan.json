  "notes": "This part of DS 781 presents the seafloor-character map Offshore of Salt Point, California (raster data file is included in \"SeafloorCharacter_SaltPoint.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html). This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes offshore of Salt Point, California. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been further divided into the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees), and Slope Class 2 (5 degrees - 30 degrees). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m), and Slopes Classes 3-4 (greater than 30 degrees) are not present in the region covered by this block. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
