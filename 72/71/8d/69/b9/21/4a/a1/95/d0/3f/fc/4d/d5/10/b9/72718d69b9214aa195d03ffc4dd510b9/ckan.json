  "notes": "This data layer contains results of the Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS). It includes polygons representing the highest quality native plant communities remaining in surveyed counties. These native plant communities are important areas for conservation. Native plant communities (sometimes also referred to as \"natural communities\") are groups of native plants that interact with each other and their surrounding environment in ways not greatly altered by modern human activity or by introduced plant or animal species. These groups of native species form recognizable units, such as an oak forest, a prairie, or a marsh, that tend to repeat across the landscape and over time. Native plant communities are generally classified and described by considering vegetation, hydrology, land forms, soils, and natural disturbance regimes. The native plant community types and subtypes in this data layer are classified primarily by vegetation and major habitat features. Classification and inventory of native plant communities is an ongoing effort of the Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program and the Minnesota County Biological Survey. The Minnesota County Biological Survey located higher quality native plant communities using aerial photo interpretation followed by field survey of selected sites. Areas that were not mapped as native plant community polygons primarily represent: 1) land where modern human activities such as farming, overgrazing, wetland drainage, recent logging and residential and commercial development have destroyed or greatly altered the natural vegetation; and 2) native plant community polygons that were below minimal size criteria. Note: some areas that were not mapped are important for conservation. They may include habitat for native plants and animals, corridors for animal movement, buffers surrounding high quality natural areas and open space, and target areas for restoration.",
