  "notes": "In this report we summarize the observations and comments made by a panel of experts brought together to conduct a Wildlife and Habitat Review for Seney National Wildlife Refuge (Seney NWR) in August of 2006.  The results of this review will guide the Refuge’s biological program from 2007 to 2012.  Prioritizing and balancing the multitude of habitat management actions required on a refuge is always a challenge for any station.  The staff at Seney Refuge have made excellent progress in prioritizing, carefully planning and executing their biological program. The Refuge staff continue to articulate and clarify their expected outcomes from a given management action before they engage in the action. Further, they typically include in their planning, a no management (aka, “What would happen if a management unit were left to take care of itself?) analysis as a matter of course.  These practices have allowed the staff to focus on restoring hydrologic function and fire processes on the Refuge, as well as maintain wildlife populations currently breeding on or migrating through the Refuge and continuing with forest restoration. More detail is provided in the body of the report. \tOverall, the panel was supportive of the current biological program at Seney NWR.  Throughout the review, panel members stressed the need for the Refuge staff to carefully develop and finalize their biological goals and objectives, focusing, where feasible, on 1) restoring major hydrological processes that have been disrupted over time, 2) restoring natural and managed fire back into the system to promote the restoration of fire dependent forest conditions and for setting back shrub encroachment in marshes and bogs, 3) maintaining wildlife populations currently breeding on or migrating through the Refuge, 4) continue with forest restoration, with the mixed pine forest restoration the priority, 5) Restoring/rehabilitating most open fields within the Refuge boundary to northern hardwood forest vegetation but maintaining Diversion Farm as an open field managed for grassland species, 6) Developing a plan for water level management in Unit 1, 7) Developing and following a plan to prevent, detect, eliminate and/or control the spread of invasive species in all units; and 8) Continue collaborations with the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments Program, the NADP (National Atmospheric Deposition Program), and the MDN (Mercury Deposition Network).",
