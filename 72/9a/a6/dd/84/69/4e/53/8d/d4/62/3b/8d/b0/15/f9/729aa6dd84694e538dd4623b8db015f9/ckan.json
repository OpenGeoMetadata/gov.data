    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains three files (.txt format). One file provides stand characteristics, biomass, and production allocation data for an old-growth boreal forest near Kuusamo, Finland. The research was conducted during the 1967-1972 growing seasons. The other two files provide climate data from a weather station about 60 km south of the forest. One record contains precipitation and mean average temperature data for the 1961-1994 period (excluding 1971-1980) and the other contains precipitation data for 1908-1994. The Kuusamo research site is located just south of the Arctic Circle (66.37 N 29.32 E) and belongs to the northern boreal zone of taiga forests. The forest is an old Hylocomium-Myrtillus type spruce forest which has remained in a natural state and reached climatic climax long ago. The average age of the dominant spruces (Picea abies) is about 260 years. There is a well-developed ground layer of vegetation, chiefly dwarf scrub and mosses (dominant species: Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Hylocomium splendens, and Pleurozium schreberi). The northerly location of the forest and the age of its trees are the main factors responsible for low biomass and net production figures in comparison with spruce forests further south. Total above-ground biomass (including tree, understory, and moss layers) was determined by harvest methods and estimated to be 10,194 g/m2. Below-ground tree biomass estimates, also determined by harvest methods, are less reliable, at 3,753 g/m2. Total net primary productivity (NPP) for this site was estimated to be 441 g/m2/yr (421 g/m2/yr above-ground, 20 g/m2/yr below-ground).",
