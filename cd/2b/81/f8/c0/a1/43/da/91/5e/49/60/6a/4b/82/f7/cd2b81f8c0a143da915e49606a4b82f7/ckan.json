    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA plans to produce cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen to power regenerative fuel cells for lunar surface exploration.  The oxygen and hydrogen will be produced by electrolysis of water from In Situ Resource Utilization reactors.  The electrolysis products will be warm high-pressure gases, requiring significant cryocooler power to achieve the desired storage conditions.  This power can be reduced by expanding the gases adiabatically from the electrolysis pressure to storage pressure.  We propose to develop innovative turboalternators to maximize this effect and convert the extracted fluid power into useful electric power.  Small flow rates and high fluid densities require turbine rotors that are extremely small and operate at high speeds.  Cryogenic gas bearings and miniature rotor fabrication techniques are key features that create high efficiency in our approach.  The gas bearings also enable reliable, long-life, maintenance-free operation.  The proposed development will leverage decades of Creare experience with cryogenic gas-bearing turbomachines.  In Phase I, we will develop optimized turboalternator designs by conducting trade studies, specifying design details, analyzing performance, and demonstrating bearing operation with two-phase rotor flow.  During Phase II, we will fabricate a prototype turboalternator and measure its performance at representative operating conditions.",
