    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop a soda-can-size, 500 g, 400 mW instrument for mounting on small lander or rover arms: the ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping (uCOSOM) instrument. Two core technologies enable the proposed instrument: a narrow linewidth deep UV  laser and a new uncooled, resistive gate linear DUV CCD array detector with high quantum efficiency in the DUV with fast read rates and low read noise.\r\n  The need for in situ micro-scale mapping for trace concentrations of organics on planetary surfaces is exemplified by requirements put forth the (July 09) Mid Range Rover; Science Analysis Group (MRR-SAG) and again in a 2010 Astrobiology paper by Pratt et al. uCOSOM fulfills similar organic needs on future in-situ missions with MER class rover/arm sizes or small landers to planetary bodies such as Mars, icy worlds (Titan, Europa, Enceladus), and small primitive bodies. uCOSOM provides a broad organic and inorganic compound measurement capability without the need for sample handling or reagents. \r\n   It will excite sub-ppb levels of organic compounds on rocks, soil, or other surfaces in the deep UV below 250 nm and simultaneously measure Raman scattering in the 250 nm to 260 nm region (1000 to 4000 cm-1) and native fluorescence in the 260 nm to 700 nm region at a working distance of several cm, with long depth of focus, and with the ability to map areas up to 1 by 1 cm in size with 100 micrometer spatial resolution. \r\n   The pulsed source enables solar blind gated Raman and fluorescence spectral measurements but also fluorescence and phosphorescence decay measurements to provide orthogonal information about target composition.\r\n  The instrument can also provide spectral reflectance of targets from 250 nm to 700 nm together with Raman and fluorescence data, using solar illumination, and enable solar and stellar irradiance and sky background measurements.",
