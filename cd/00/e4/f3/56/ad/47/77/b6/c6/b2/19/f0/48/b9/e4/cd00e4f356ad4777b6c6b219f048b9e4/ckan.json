  "notes": "This report includes beach use data from 1977. Data includes weekly shore bird, ghost crab cavities, and public use counts. These counts were done on both Pea Island NWR and Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Weekly shore-bird, ghost crab cavities, and public use counts were made on one mile sections of Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge beach and Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach during the period of June 4 through October 16, 1977. Daily public use and wildlife surveys were run on the entire Pea Island Refuge beach during the same period. Bird numbers,, ghost crab cavities, public use and off-road vehicle use were recorded on Pea Island on weekends and weekdays. All activities were recorded on the daily surveys on Pea Island. No nesting activities were found on Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach but least terns made two unsuccessful attempts to nest on Pea Island Refuge. During the period of June 4 through September 4, on the two areas studied, total number of people were found to be about the same. However, bird use in total numbers, was more than 2 to 1 higher and ghost crab cavities were more than 4 to 1 higher on the Cape Hatteras Seashore beach than on Pea Island Refuge. Species richness for birds was also higher on Cape Hatteras Seashore. All factors considered the same, except that off-road vehicles were not allowed on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach, it appears that off-road vehicles, on the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge beach does have a significant effect on bird use, total number, and species richness and ghost crab populations.",
