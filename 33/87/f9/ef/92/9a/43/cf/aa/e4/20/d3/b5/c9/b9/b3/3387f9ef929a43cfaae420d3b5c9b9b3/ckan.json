  "notes": " The Paladin Software Support Environment (SSE) occupies 2,241 square-feet. It contains the hardware and software tools required to support the Paladin Automatic Fire Control System (AFCS) operational software, which includes software engineering, integration and software qualification testing. The Paladin SSE consists of 8 complete Paladin test environments, where each environment can support testing individually or combined together as an 8 gun battery configuration to perform mutli-guns testing. Additionally, the Paladin SSE contains 4 of the AFCS PC-Trainers. The SSE incorporates the tactical command, control and communications systems, e.g., AFATDS and DMD to replicate field communications and operations, as well as emulations for the inertial and servo systems to provide realistic representations of the entire weapon. The Paladin SSE is also equipped with outdoor radio antennas mounted on the building&amp;#39;s rooftop which are capable of communicating with the Paladin howitzer through out the arsenal area and supports the actual vehicle movement testing. An outside GPS antenna is being connected and the signal is being re-radiated through out the laboratory, thus eliminating multiple GPS antennas and providing GPS signal in the laboratories and highbay area. Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are connected to over 70 PC based test equipment in the test environment. The UPS will prevent any power glitches from effecting our lab equipment and the potential lose of data during testing.  ",
