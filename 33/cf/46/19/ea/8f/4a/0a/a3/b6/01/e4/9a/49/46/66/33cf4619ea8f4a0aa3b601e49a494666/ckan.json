    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Damage characterization through wave propagation and scattering is of considerable interest to many non-destructive evaluation techniques. For fiber-reinforced composites, complex waves can be generated during the tests due to the non-homogeneous and anisotropic nature of the material when compared to isotropic materials. Additional complexities are introduced due to the presence of the damage and thus results in difficulty to characterize these defects. The inability to detect damage in composite structures limits their use in practice. A major task of structural health monitoring is to identify and characterize the existing defects or defect evolution through the interactions between structural features and multidisciplinary physical phenomena. In a wave-based approach to addressing this problem, the presence of damage is characterized by the changes in the signature of the resultant wave that propagates through the structure. In order to measure and characterize the wave propagation, we use the response of the surface-mounted piezoelectric transducers as input to an advanced machine-learning based classifier known as a support vector machine.",
