  "notes": "This data set is the topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements for four counties in Georgia. These counties are: Burke, Columbia, Lincoln, and Richmond. The Statement of Work (SOW) was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Services Center (referred to as the Center) in partnership with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) Environmental Protection Division (EPD). LiDAR data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The LiDAR sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The LiDAR systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The LiDAR data acquisition and processing for Burke, Lincoln, and Richmond County was performed in the Winter of 2011. The LiDAR data was provided to NOAA CSC, as part of the 4 GA Counties of Elevation Data task order. The 4 GA Counties of Elevation Data task order AOI encompassed approximately 1,739 square miles. The area of interest acquired and processed for Burke, Lincoln, and Richmond County is approximately 1,386 square miles. The task order required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1.0 meter. The LiDAR data was collected to meet Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 18.0 cm or better at a 95% confidence level, so that when combined with breaklines, the data adequately supports the generation of two (2) foot FEMA compliant contours. The final LiDAR data was delivered in 5,000' x 5,000' tiles using North American Datum 1983, Georgia State Plane Coordinate System, East Zone, and expressed in US Survey Feet. For data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes, the NOAA CSC converted the data to geographic coordinates and ellipsoid heights in meters. Special Note: Temporal changes of water levels will be observed in any data from Richmond and Lincoln counties overlapping any previously delivered data from Columbia County. The final products include full classified LAS, hydrologically flattened four (4) foot pixel raster DEM's of the bare earth surface in ESRI Floating Point Grid Format (ArcGRID DEMs), and hydrologically flattened breaklines. The data were collected on the following dates: Burke and Richmond Counties: December 13, 14, 17, 2011 Columbia County February 26, 2011 Lincoln County December 18, 2011 The data contains las points with the following classifications: Class 0 No Classification Class 2 Ground Class 7 Low Point (Noise) Class 9 Water Class 10 Land below sea level Class 12 Overlap",
