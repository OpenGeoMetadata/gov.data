    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Current Technology for CO2 removal from enclosed air of spacecraft utilizes LiOH canisters for CO2 absorption.  This absorption is irreversible so longer flights require more LiOH.  For long duration flights it is essential that a small, lightweight system that recovers the CO2 be developed.  This allows the CO2 to be used to regenerate O2 for re-use.\r\n\r\nCompact Membrane systems (CMS) has identified a novel membrane contactor process for absorption and subsequent desorption of the CO2.  Key to the process is that the contactor both operate effectively and that loss of the absorption/desorption fluid be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIn Phase I, CMS will build system and demonstrate systems capability with a focus on key desorption unit operation.  Analysis will demonstrate ability to transport CO2 while maintaining minimal loss of absorbent.  System stability will be demonstrated by evaluating performance over wide temperature range (30-90o C).  Chemical stability with absorbants will also be demonstrated.  With all the above basic data in hand, we will evaluate the needed system size, weight and power consumption.  Lastly we will compare results to molecular sieve adsorbants which are the incumbent for long duration flights.\r\n",
