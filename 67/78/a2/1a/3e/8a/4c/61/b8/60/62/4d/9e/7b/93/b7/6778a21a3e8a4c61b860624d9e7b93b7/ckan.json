  "notes": "The 2006 OSIP digital LiDAR data was collected during the months of March and May (leaf-off conditions). The LiDAR covers the entire land area of the northern tier of Ohio (approximately 23,442 square miles. The LiDAR is delivered in county sets, consisting of 5,000' x 5,000' size tiles. Where the State borders other states (land only), the entire border of the State is buffered by at least 1,000-feet. Along the Lake Erie Shoreline ortho coverage is buffered beyond the shoreline a minimum distance of 2,500-feet. Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS50 digital LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: Nxxxxyyy = 5,000' x 5,000' LiDAR Tiles located in the Ohio State Plane Coordinate System (North Zone). Sxxxxyyy = 5,000' x 5,000' LiDAR Tiles located in the Ohio State Plane Coordinate System (South Zone). Please note that xxxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet, The naming convention for each LiDAR tile is based upon (the bottom most-left pixel). The LiDAR was provided in LAS Format containing the above ground and bare-earth LiDAR features. Ownership of the data products resides with the State of Ohio. Orthophotography and ancillary data products produced through this contract are public domain data. LiDAR was acquired Statewide to provide a solid and very accurate base to use during the image rectification process. This same LiDAR can be supplemented with 3D breaklines to generate 2-foot and/or 4/5-foot contours. The average post spacing between LiDAR points is 7-feet. The flying altitude was 7,300-feet AMT, with the targeted flying speed at 170 knots.",
