  "notes": "The data set represents the annual count of bank swallow burrows at nesting colonies located along the Sacramento River. The data set contains two databases which are intended to be used together. One contains the observations of the bank swallow nesting colonies and the other contains the locations of the river mile points used by the observers to reference their location and therefore the location of the nesting colonies. Both of these databases should be used together and are found together in the Natural Resource Layers section on the iMaps screen. TIME PERIOD COVERED. Annual monitoring of bank swallow nesting colonies on the Sacramento River started in 1986. The data reported here cover the monitoring surveys made from 1986 through 1992 and 1994 through 2002. See Geographic Extent of Records below. NUMBER OF RECORDS. The database contains 541 observations records, made over 16 years of surveys, of nesting bank swallow colonies. GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT OF THE RECORDS. This data set only pertains to nesting colony surveys along the Sacramento River, from river mile (rm) 80 (mouth of the Feather River) upstream to river mile 292 (Redding). This includes river banks in Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Colusa, Butte, Sutter, and Yolo Counties. Full surveys (from rm 80 to rm 292) were made in 1986-87 and 1990. Surveys in the lower portion of the survey route (rm 80 to rm 144) were not conducted in 1988, 2001 and 2002, and no colony specific data are available for 1989, 1990, and 1992-93. Data from the upper portion of the survey route (rm 243 to rm 292) were only collected in the years with the full surveys (1986-87 and 1990). While surveys have been conducted in the middle portion of the survey route (rm 144 to rm 243, and where the most bank swallow colonies are), no colony specific data are available for 1993-95. BASE DATA STRUCTURE. The data set consists of an Access database and .dbf format database. Each has a single data table.",
