    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The I-Logix team proposes development of the Service Oriented Spacecraft Modeling Environment (SOSME) to allow faster and more effective spacecraft system design using a model based design process.  The SOSME consists of several innovations:\r\n1.\tService-Oriented Architecture for Spacecraft System Modeling (SOASSM).    \r\n2.\tGeneral-Purpose Spacecraft Reference Model (GPSRM) implementing the SOASSM.\r\n3.\tRequirements-Driven Model Customization Application (RDMCA) to aid in customizing the GPSRM to reflect a specific spacecraft system design.  \r\n4.\tMission Scenario Generation Application (MSGA) to aid in capturing mission scenarios and execute models developed using the SOASSM against the mission scenarios.  \r\n\r\nThe significance of these innovations is that they will:\r\n1.\tEnable and facilitate a model based system design process for spacecraft systems.\r\n2.\tEnable rapid development of spacecraft system models in support of Trade Studies.\r\n3.\tEnable more effective and accurate trade studies by executing models against mission scenarios while capturing quantitative measures of performance.\r\n4.\tProvide graphical and executable artifacts for use in project and peer reviews.\r\n5.\tEnable system level validation against mission scenarios throughout the design process.\r\n6.\tFacilitate the integration of detailed design models by providing standard interfaces for spacecraft services.\r\n7.\tFacilitate Simulation Based Acquisition.\r\n8.\tEnable Model Based Contracting.",
