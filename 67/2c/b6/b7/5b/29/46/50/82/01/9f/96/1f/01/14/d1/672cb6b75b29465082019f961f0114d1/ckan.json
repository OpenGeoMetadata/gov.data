  "notes": "This management plan for the dusky Canada goose (Branta canadensis occidentalis) is a revision of earlier plans adopted by the Pacific Flyway Council (1973, 1985, 1992, 1997).During the 1997 revision, Pacific Flyway agencies commissioned a conservation assessment to review biological knowledge of dusky geese and the history of management actions (Bromleyand Rothe 2003); see this document for more extensive information and literature review. Dusky Canada geese nest primarily on the Copper River Delta (CRD) of south-central Alaska(Figure 1a). The primary wintering area is in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon and on the floodplain of the lower Columbia River in western Oregon and Washington (Figure 1b).Historically, midwinter population indices for the dusky goose (Figure 2) increased from less than 10,000 in the early 1950's to over 26,000 in 1975, largely as a result of cooperative harvest management, expansion of winter foraging habitats, and creation of refuges in southwest Washington and western Oregon. The population declined steeply in the early 1980s, falling below 10,000 in 1984 and 1985, as effects of the 1964 Alaska earthquake accelerated changes to breeding ground habitats. Rapidly expanding shrubs and trees were favorable to brown bears and other mammalian predators that significantly increased predation on nests and adult geese. During the 1990s, low levels of production and a gradual decline in breeding birds resulted in a moderately stable population of about 15,000 duskys. Over the past five years, annual production has remained low, now primarily from nest predation by bald eagles, but the population has been maintained by a couple of productive years. With ongoing forest succession on the Copper River Delta and associated predation on geese, impaired production will likely limit the population of dusky geese for the long term.In addition to concerns about the diminished population, management of dusky geese on their wintering grounds is complicated by the concurrent use by other goose subspecies, including lesser (B. c. parvipes), Vancouver (B. c. fulva), and western (B. c. moffitti) Canada geese; and Tavernerâ€™s (B. hutchinsii taverneri), cackling (B. h. minima), and Aleutian (B. h. leucopareia)cackling geese (see Taxonomy below). Large numbers of mixed white-cheeked geese cause problems in conducting winter inventories, designing optimal harvest regulations, controlling crop depredation, and assessing carrying capacity of winter habitats for all geese (see Appendix A).",
