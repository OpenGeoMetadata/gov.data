  "notes": "This dataset is a part of U.S. Geological Survey Central Region Energy Resources Team National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, Legacy Data Archive. The National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, (NPRA) Legacy Data Archive represents one of the largest geological and geophysical data sets held by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). From 1944 to 1953 the U.S. Navy operated a large-scale exploration of the then Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4, drilling 36 test wells and 45 core tests. A second extensive exploration program was operated between 1974 and 1982. Run first by the U.S. Navy and later the USGS, this exploration program collected over 12,000 line miles of seismic data and drilled 28 exploratory wells. Both these exploration programs generated a vast amount of data, analyses, and documents, much of which is presented at http://nerslweb.cr.usgs.gov/. This web site makes available the following data types: SEG-Y format seismic data. Image files of associated seismic data documentation. Tables of seismic data field collection parameters. Seismic data location information, both ASCII text files and image files of location maps. Image files of seismic data displays. Image files of well log displays. LAS format digital well log data. Adobe Acrobat files of well data, analyses, and reports. Image files of well core slides. This NPRA Seismic lines Dataset was converted from Shot Point latitude and longitude information.",
