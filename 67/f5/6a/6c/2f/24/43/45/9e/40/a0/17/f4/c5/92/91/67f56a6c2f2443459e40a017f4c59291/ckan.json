      "description": "The geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping,\nnorth-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, along\nwhich geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking,\nwest-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into two\nstructural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and a\nyounger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and later\nsouthwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement may\nhave generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development of\nthe geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults\noccurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the Cottonwood\nCreek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplunging\nfault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hot\nsprings and sinter terraces.\nYoung structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cuts\nQuaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentary\nrocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking,\nnormal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within several\nkilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springs\n(~90°C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermal\nfield lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone,\nwhich locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.",

  "notes": "Detailed geologic mapping (1:24,000 scale), structural and geochemical analyses,\nand integration of available geophysical and well-field data were utilized to assess the\nstructural controls of the Neal Hot Springs geothermal field in eastern Oregon. The\ngeothermal field lies within the intersection of two regional grabens, the middle-late\nMiocene, north-trending, Oregon-Idaho graben and younger late Miocene to Holocene,\nnorthwest-trending, western Snake River Plain graben. It is marked by Neal Hot Springs,\nwhich effuse from opaline sinter mounds just north of Bully Creek. Production and\ninjection wells, with temperatures up to 142°C, intersect the Neal fault zone at depths of\n680-1900 m and subsidiary faults within a relay ramp or step-over within the fault zone.\nThe stratigraphy at Neal correlates with four regional packages. Basement rocks,\ndiscovered in one well, are granite, tentatively correlated with Jurassic Olds Ferry-Izee\nterrane. Nonconformably above is a thick package of middle Miocene Columbia River\nBasalt Group lavas, regionally known as the basalt of Malheur Gorge. Conformably\nabove are middle to late Miocene Oregon-Idaho graben lavas, volcaniclastics, fluvial and\nlacustrine rocks. Overlying are the youngest rocks at Neal, which are late Miocene to\nPliocene, western Snake River Plain lacustrine, fluvial, and volcaniclastic rocks.\nThe structural framework at Neal is characterized by northerly to northweststriking\nnormal faults, including the geothermally related Neal fault zone. Stress\ninversion of kinematic data reveal an extensional stress regime, including an interpreted\nyounger, southwest-trending (~243°), least principal stress and an older, west-trending\n(~265°) least principal stress.\nThe geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping,\nnorth-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, along\nwhich geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking,\nwest-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into two\nstructural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and a\nyounger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and later\nsouthwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement may\nhave generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development of\nthe geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults\noccurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the Cottonwood\nCreek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplunging\nfault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hot\nsprings and sinter terraces.\nYoung structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cuts\nQuaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentary\nrocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking,\nnormal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within several\nkilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springs\n(~90°C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermal\nfield lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone,\nwhich locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.",
