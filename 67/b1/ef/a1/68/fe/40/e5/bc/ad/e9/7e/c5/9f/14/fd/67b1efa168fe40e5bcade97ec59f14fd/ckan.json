  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 3x3 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of several deep coral priority areas off the Atlantic Coast of Florida, derived from data collected in November 2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from the Lost Coast Explorer on 10/28/2010 to 10/31/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option \"BASE Surface to Image\" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRI's Spatial Analyst extension.",
