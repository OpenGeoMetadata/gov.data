    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Science Mission Directorate is chartered with answering fundamental questions requiring the view from and into space.  Its future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface of planets and small bodies (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space.  This drives a need for propulsion technologies that enable precision landing, hazard avoidance, in-space rendezvous, and ascent/decent vehicle propulsion.  These missions will entail higher propulsion system duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. Moreover, propulsion system objectives will need to be met with more stringent constraints on mass, volume, power, and cost.\r\n\r\nC3 Propulsion proposes the development of an advanced CV engine prototype featuring an innovative combination of multiple throttling techniques to enable sustained deep throttling without sacrificing engine performance. The Constant Volume combustion engine is an innovative design that combines light weight, low pressure fuel tanks and operates at high chamber pressures. The CV engine has nearly identical specific impulse as a constant pressure engine with the same mass flow and throat area, furthermore, the nozzle optimizes at the same area ratio. It has exceptional thrust-to-weight ratios. It will be designed for high duty cycle, extended operation to satisfy SMD mission requirements. The suitability of this engine for a range of SMD missions will be proven through engine testing that demonstrates deep throttling capability, and the development of appropriate scaling laws that allow engine sizing to be performed based on mission requirements.",
