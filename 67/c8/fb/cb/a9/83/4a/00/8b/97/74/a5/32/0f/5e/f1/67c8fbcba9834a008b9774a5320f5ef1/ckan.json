The HYDRO data layer contains all annotation used in producing the atlas. The annotation features are categorized into three subclasses in order to simplify the mapping and quality control procedures: GEOG, for geographic features; SOC, for socioeconomic features; and HYDRO, for water features.This data set comprises a portion of the ESI data for the Hudson River. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
