  "notes": "These hillshade datasets were derived from USGS 7.5' DEM Quads for the main 8 Hawaiian Islands. Individual DEM quads were first converted to a common datum, and vertical unit, and subsequently mosaicked in ArcGIS 9.x. The hillshade were created from these DEMs using the Hillshade function in ArcGIS 9.2's Spatial Analyst Extension. For all the hillshades, the altitude was set at 45, the Z factor at 1 and the output cell size at 10. The azimuth was set to 45 for the Hawaii (Big Island), Maui and Kauai hillshades. The azimuth was set to 315 for the remaining island hillshades. All rasters are 16 bit signed integers with a spatial resolution of 10 meters. They are in the ERDAS Imagine (.img) format and are referenced to the NAD83 UTM coordinate system. The hillshade for Hawaii (Big Island) is in UTM zone 5N, and the hillshades for the remaining 7 islands are in UTM zone 4N. On this metadata sheet, the bounding coordinates and row and column counts are for a hypothetical 10m grid that would contain the 8 main Hawaiian Islands. For bounding coordinates and the number of rows and columns for each actual, individual hillshade, users should consult their respective layer properties.",
