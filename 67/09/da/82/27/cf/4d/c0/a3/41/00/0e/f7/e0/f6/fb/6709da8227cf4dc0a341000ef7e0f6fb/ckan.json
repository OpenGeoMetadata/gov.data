  "notes": "This part of DS 781 presents data for the folds for the geologic and geomorphic map of Monterey Canyon and Vicinity, California. The vector data file is included in \"Folds_MontereyCanyon.zip,\" which is accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7XD0ZQ4. The shelf in the Monterey Bay and Vicinity map area is cut by a diffuse zone of northwest-striking, steeply dipping to vertical faults mapped with high-resolution, seismic-reflection profiles (sheet 8). Faults are mapped on the basis of abrupt truncation or warping of reflections and (or) juxtaposition of reflection panels with different seismic parameters. Seismic profiles traversing this diffuse zone cross as many as 13 faults over a distance of 8 km (for example, fig. 3, sheet 8). Mapped fault lengths in this diffuse zone are typically 2 to 7 km, and the strike of these offshore faults rotates from about 325° to 350° from southwest to northeast. Faults in this diffuse zone cut through Neogene bedrock and locally appear to disrupt overlying latest Quaternary sediments, and the presence of warped reflections along some fault strands suggests there may be both vertical and strike-slip offsets. This broad, distributed zone of deformation resembles the northwest-trending Monterey Bay Fault Zone (Greene, 1977, 1990), which occurs about 10 km farther west in outer Monterey Bay and similarly lacks a lengthy (> 20 km), continuous \"master fault.\" Deformation in both the Monterey Bay Fault Zone and the diffuse zone of faults in the Monterey Bay and Vicinity map area is attributable to its location in the 40-km-wide, northward-narrowing structural zone between two major, right-lateral, strike-slip faults, the San Andreas Fault to the east and the offshore San Gregorio Fault to the west (fig. 1-1) (McCulloch, 1987; Brabb, 1997; Wagner and others, 2002; Dickinson and others, 2005). Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see OFR 2013-1071). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.
