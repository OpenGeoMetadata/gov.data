    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal to NASA requests $596,750.96 support for Policell Technologies, Inc. to develop a series of separator membranes having a selectable thermal shut-down temperature for a period of 24 months. The separator will be used in the making of high performance batteries. This proposal responds to Topic Number F3.09, \"Power Technologies for Human Missions\".\r\n\r\nThe innovation is the development of a novel separator membrane that has a selectable thermal shut-down temperature. The Phase II plan is to develop the following 5 grades: 120, 110, 100, 90, and 80oC. \r\n\r\nThe significance of the innovations is that with the use of the novel separator, the resulting rechargeable lithium-ion battery will: 1) have a selectable and significantly lower thermal shut-down temperature than that of the commercial separators. Thus, the cells will be much safer, 2) offer higher energy density, 3) have longer cycle life, lower as well as stable impedance during charge-discharge, 4) offer ultimately overall low cost. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications include for making battery as mobile power sources for devices such as cellular phones, notebook computers, military used devices, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). The NASA applications include mobile power sources for space.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator, Dr. Luying Sun, is qualified to perform this work as he has been an expert in this field. Since 1993, the Principal Investigator has been involved in the research and development of separator membrane, electrolyte, and lithium-ion battery. \r\n",
