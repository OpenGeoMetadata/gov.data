    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NanoSonic has developed a candidate state-of-the-art inflatable as a novel bladder material for life critical, space habitats that maintains low air permeability (&lt; 0.0017 cc/100in2/day/atm) upon the triple fold cold flex test conducted at -50 ?C.  The multifunctional Thoraeus Rubber&amp;#153; (TR) films are comprised of a low glass transition temperature (Tg), - 100 ?C, copolymer matrix resin modified with alternating layers of ultra-thin, uniform layers of proprietary nanoparticles for radiation resistance.  NanoSonic's unique molecular level deposition technique yields pinhole-free nanocomposites with that maintain radiation and EMI shielding (up to -100 dB) upon severe (50 &#37; elongation) and repeated mechanical strain, a property that few if any inflatable exhibit.  NanoSonic proposes to produce a triply redundant bladder assembly comprised of several layers of TR&amp;#153; films bonded with our low areal density self-healing foam, for a total areal density of less than 6 oz/yd2.  To substantiate long-term use in space, the down-selected, puncture resistant assemblies shall be exposed to gamma, electron, and heavy ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory via our partner, Colorado State University (CSU).  Low air permeability and flammability resistance would be verified after simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure and cryogenic flex testing.  NanoSonic has teamed with seaming and space systems experts who will conduct leak and adhesion testing, and assist with habitat construction.  In support of NASA's goals for a robust space exploration program, it is anticipated that NanoSonic's lightweight, low permeable bladders shall enable space inflatable modules that exhibit long-term, 5 year, radiation resistance upon inflation, minimize launch mass, repair/maintenance, size and costs.",
