  "notes": "The objectives of this study were to (1) assess population trends in Euphorbia esula, the biocontrol flea beetles, Aphthona lacertosa and A. nigriscutis, and native vegetation, over the course of the study and (2) determine the effect of competitive plantings, nitrogen manipulation, and their interaction, in the presence of herbivory by Aphthona spp., on E. esula persistence, reproduction and spread.    As of 2003, we were unable to demonstrate that either seeding or carbon (sawdust) application had significantly changed nitrogen mineralization rates or had any significant influence on leafy spurge abundance. Nonetheless, trends in the change in nitrogen mineralization suggest that given enough time, sawdust addition may influence nitrogen availability; plots with sawdust addition only had roughly twice the decline in nitrogen mineralization from 2000-2003 as did other treatments (including seed+ sawdust).    Although leafy spurge frequency (measured as proportion of occurrence in all 0.5 x 2m permanent plots at a site) has fluctuated over the years, it had rebounded from a low in 2001 to close to the average for the 4-year period in 2003. Biomass of leafy spurge also has remained constant over our sample period, but stem counts on permanent quadrats within the frequency plots have declined over the three study sites (Arrowwood West, Grasshopper Hills and Tewaukon (Heartleben)). This observation is consistent with the idea that allocation to vegetative spread increases with herbivory, such that the overall population remains constant even as local stem counts decline.    Aphthona lacertosci was by far the more abundant flea beetle at the study sites, and we could attribute some decline in leafy spurge stem counts to A. lacertosa but not to A. nigriscutis. We found no evidence of competition between the two flea beetle species, however, so the continued use of both species should not be problematic. The majority of the decline in stem counts in any given year was mainly attributable to the previous year's stem count, i.e., quadrats with high stem counts in one year were more likely to have declining counts the following year. This suggests that density-dependent effects, such as soil pathogens or intraspecific competition, may have begun to influence trends in the leafy spurge population.",
