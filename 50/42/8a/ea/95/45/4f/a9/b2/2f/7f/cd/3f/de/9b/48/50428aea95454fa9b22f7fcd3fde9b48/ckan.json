The MTDB represents a\n          seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line\n          shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined\n          to cover the entire nation. For the 2010 Census, subMCDs only exist in Puerto Rico. In\n          Puerto Rico the subMCDs are termed subbarrios and are legally defined subdivisions of the\n          minor civil division (MCD) named barrios-pueblo and barrios. The boundaries of the\n          subbarrios are as of January 1, 2010 and were provided to the Census Bureau by the Puerto\n          Rico Planning Board.",
