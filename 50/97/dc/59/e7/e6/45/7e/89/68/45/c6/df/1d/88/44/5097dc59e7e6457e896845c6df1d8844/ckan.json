    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Prognostics has received considerable attention recently as an emerging sub-discipline within SHM. Prognosis is here strictly defined as “predicting the time at which a component will no longer perform its intended function”. Loss of function is often times the time at which a component fails. The predicted time to that point becomes then the remaining useful life (RUL). For prognostics to be effective, it must be performed well before deviations from normal performance propagate to a critical effect. This enables a failure preclusion or prevention function to repair or replace the offending components, or if the components cannot be repaired, to retire the system (or vehicle) before the critical failure occurs. Therefore, prognosis has the promise to provide critical information to system operators that will enable safer operation and more cost-efficient use. To that end, Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, and industry have been investigating this technology for use in their vehicle health management solutions. Dedicated prognostic algorithms (in conjunction with failure detection and fault isolation algorithms) must be developed that are capable of operating in an autonomous and real-time vehicle health management system software architecture that is possibly distributed in nature. This envisioned prognostic and health management system will be realized in a vehicle-level reasoner that must have visibility and insight into the results of local diagnostic and prognostic technologies implemented at the LRU and subsystem levels. Accomplishing this effectively requires an integrated suite of prognostic technologies that compute failure effect propagation through diverse subsystems and that can capture interactions that occur in these subsystems. In this chapter a generic set of selected prognostic algorithm approaches is presented and an overview of the required vehicle-level reasoning architecture needed to integrate the prognostic information across systems is provided.",
