  "notes": "The goals of this study were to determine the nature and extent of environmental contaminant burdens in the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) population of the St. Lawrence River, New York, and to evaluate the potential for negative impacts to that population. Reproductive parameters and contaminant burdens of the Common Tern population were compared to the Niagara River, Atlantic coast and Great Lakes populations. Between 1986 and 1990, 41 Common Tern egg and 24 forage fish samples from the St. Lawrence River were collected and analyzed for organic and elemental residues. The data gathered in this study provide an excellent data base of contaminant levels upon which future monitoring can be based. The results indicated that Common Terns were good indicators of local contamination. The results also indicated that the levels of PCBs, DDE, dieldrin, and mercury may be related to the low reproductive success of terns at some colonies and to the types and rates of abnormalities observed in chicks. Using only breeding success as an indicator of contaminant effects, there would not appear to be any relationship between the levels of contaminants and reproductive performance in terns. However, the incidence of chick abnormalities observed was comparable to those reported for an Atlantic coast population, which was heavily contaminated with PCBs. This suggests that the exposure of St. Lawrence River terns to contaminants may be causing the abnormalities observed in tern chicks. In addition, the lower breeding success of terns observed at two sites, with significantly higher levels of PCBs, DDE and dieldrin than in the third site studied, may be related to the parental neglect exhibited by adult terns. These results exhibit a pattern consistent with the research of others addressing the Great Lakes embryo mortality, edema, and deformities syndrome, which may have been demonstrated in the St. Lawrence River tern population. Other evidence that the contaminant levels reported in this study may be impacting terns and other fish-eating birds were derived from a risk assessment. The results indicated that the levels of PCBs, DDE, dieldrin and mercury in eggs and forage fish exceeded levels that are protective of fish-eating birds. Based on the findings of this study, several areas of additional study for the St. Lawrence River are suggested.",
