  "notes": "Until about 100 years ago the lower part of the Maumee River in northwest Ohio flowed through the Great Black Swamp, 7500 km2 of flat lowland forest (Francis et al. 1979). Water entering Lake Erie from the Maumee River was clear. The fish fauna of the area required water free of clayey silts and wild rice was abundant in Maumee Bay (Trautman 1981). In the period since the mid-1800s the area has been deforested, drained, and canalized for agriculture. Runoff from agriculture has caused the Maumee River to become very muddy with an annual sediment load to Lake Erie of 1,800,000 metric tons (Francis et al. 1979). Beds of inshore aquatic vegetation and spawning areas for many species of fish were destroyed by this sedimentation. Navigation channels in Maumee Bay must now be annually dredged at great expense. In terms of toxic contamination, Lake Erie is one of the cleanest of the Great Lakes. Its primary problem in the past has been eutrophication caused by phosphorus from agricultural fertilizers and waste water treatment plants. Waste water pollution has come under control in recent years, but agricultural non-point pollution remains a problem. Although Lake Erie is relatively clean, there is an Ohio fish consumption advisory in effect for carp and channel catfish. The advisory was established because these species appeared to contain residues of PCBs above the 2 ppm limit set by the Food and Drug Administration. This advisory was based on sketchy data, and the State of Ohio is currently conducting a more complete survey of contaminants in fish tissue. There has also been speculation that PCBs or other contaminants in the lake might be responsible for the poor reproductive performance of bald eagles that nest near Lake Erie. Tests of dredge spoil from Maumee Bay show relatively low concentrations of PCBs, but I am not aware of sediment studies from other parts of the bay. There is a possibility that past discharges of PCB laden oil from known sources on Otter Creek and Ottawa River entered Maumee Bay. A 1990 study by Ohio EPA showed levels of total PCBs in sediments of the Ottawa River to range from 0.71 to 110 ppm (Ohio EPA 1991). A tributary storm water runoff ditch that receives water from an industrialized area contained sediments with up to 1200 ppm of PCBs. PCB residues (mainly Aroclor 1248) in fish of the Ottawa River (whole body carp, length unspecified) ranged from 9.225 to 84.177 ppm. The concentration of PCBs (Aroclor 1248) in sediments from river mile 1 of the Ottawa River, the sample site nearest the mouth of the river, was 1.582 ppm. The purpose of this study was to survey the northern part of Maumee Bay for PCBs in sediment and in the process test out the new immunochemical PCB test kit technology. Discussion and Conclusion: Studies by Frank et al. (1977) found sediment PCB concentrations to be 2 or 3 times higher in depositional zones of the Great Lakes than in nondepositional zones. A study of Lake Michigan by Armstrong in 1981 also found that areas of recent sedimentation had the highest PCB concentrations and areas of scour had the lowest levels. Most of Maumee Bay is probably an area of sediment deposition. Frank et al. (1977) reported the highest sediment concentrations of PCBs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie to be 660 ng/g (ppb), 330 ng/g in the Central Basin, and 320 ng/g in the Eastern Basin. By these numbers the Maumee Basin sediment concentrations found in this study are very low, the highest concentration being 147 ng/g (0.147 ppm). The limitations of this study prevent confident conclusions. I can only conclude that samples of sediment from Maumee Bay probably contained less than 3 ppm of PCBs.",
