Compliance, surveillance, and special assignment samples are tested, as well as testing on consumer complaint samples. Chemistry analytical capability includes testing for pesticides, mycotoxins, aflatoxins, drug (dissolution testing, NDA/ANDA pharmacopeia forum method validations and active pharmaceutical ingredients), chemotherapeutic agents (malachite green, quinolones, fluoroquinolones) in aqua cultured seafood, chloramphenicol, patulin, nitrates, and others as required. Microbiological analytical capability includes organoleptic/sensory (including National Sensory expertise), mycotoxins, food microbiology (both conventional and molecular techniques/PCR), micro analytical entomology/filth (including BSE prohibited materials), canned seam analysis, water activity, pH, water phase salt, and others as required.BSL2 Lab. A2LA accredited.  Specialized Capabilities  Applied Technology Center (ATC) conducts chemical and microbiological investigations and method development. ATC has DNA sequencing capacity and is testing technology for pathogen identification. ATC has many ongoing research initiatives for rapid molecular testing and detection of decomposition indicators in seafood. ATC has many notable National awards and publications in peer reviewed journals.  ",
