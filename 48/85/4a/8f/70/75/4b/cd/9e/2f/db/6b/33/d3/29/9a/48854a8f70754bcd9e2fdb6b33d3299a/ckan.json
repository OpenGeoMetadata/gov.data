    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A compact, low-power GN&amp;amp;C system is essential to the success of\npico-satellite Automated Rendezvous and Docking (AR&amp;amp;D).  Austin\nSatellite Design (ASD) proposes to deliver a working design of an\nintegrated six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) Guidance, Navigation, and Control\n(GN&amp;amp;C) system for pico-satellites at the conclusion of Phase 1 of\nthis STTR.  A six DOF translation and rotation determination and control\nsystem will be designed for a pico-satellite form-factor to generate the\nonboard guidance and control necessary to demonstrate autonomous control\nstability and perform simple proximity maneuvers.  An existing NASA/JSC\nGPS receiver will be utilized for navigation.  Added sensors, such as a\nmagnetometer, will be combined with GPS signals for attitude\ndetermination.  A thruster actuator concept will be identified and a\ndesign produced that satisfies anticipated operational requirements and\nthat fits within the mass and power constraints of the pico-satellite\nmission.  Flight hardware will not be procured until Phase 2; however,\ncomponent characteristics will be documented and modeled during Phase 1\nand GN&amp;amp;C algorithms will be written to include them.  Software that\ncan be deployed to embedded systems will be written and validated in\nsimulation.  At the conclusion of Phase 1, simulated GN&amp;amp;C will be\ndemonstrated within a pico-satellite form factor using embedded software\nsuch that a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 is achieved.",
