    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The design concepts being considered for Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations.  While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials.\r\nTherefore, MR&amp;D is proposing to use the lessons learned from the Phase I effort, to improve the strength prediction capabilities, evaluate the effects of porosity and molding of curved panels, and deliver a beta version of a 3D weave design optimization tool. A combined analytical and experimental program has been proposed.  The analytical effort involves modifying the current version of the 3D weave modeling tool, based on the lessons learned in the Phase I program, to include things such as unique bundle strengths for the different yarn types and improved failure criteria to improve the strength prediction capabilities.  It also includes increasing the current capabilities to allow for estimating properties of 3D woven composites with varying levels of porosity or that have been molded into curved panels.  The experimental effort involves fabrication and testing of various 3D woven reinforced composites (flat, curved, partially densified).  The properties obtained from this experimental effort will enable improved calibration of the modeling tools.  Finally, the final portion of the Phase II effort will focus on the preparation of a beta version of the 3D weave design optimization tool for delivery to NASA for use in heat shield design as well as other applications requiring the use of 3D woven preforms.",
