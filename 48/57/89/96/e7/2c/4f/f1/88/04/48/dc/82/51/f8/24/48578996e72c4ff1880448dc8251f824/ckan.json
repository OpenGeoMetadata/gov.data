    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The goal of this Project is to develop a high-fidelity computational tool for accurate prediction of aerothermal environment on transatmospheric vehicles. This computational tool will be based on the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) developed at CFDRC for hybrid simulations of rarefied, transitional and continuum flows. In this Project, the UFS will be enhanced with advanced non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to radiation transport and plasma capabilities. The enhanced UFS will include Boltzmann/continuum solvers for gas species and plasma electrons, state-to-state vibrational kinetics of molecules, advanced non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to radiation transport with real gas effects, and charged particle transport and chemistry. Our two strong points are (i) master equations coupled with nonequilibrium chemistry in a multidimensional code, and (ii) Boltzmann solvers for charges and neutral particles providing the capability of using the code both for reentry flows and for the low-temperature plasma flows. Phase I will be devoted to evaluation of physical models, initial implementation and demonstration of new capabilities. In Phase II, these capabilities will be fully developed, validated and demonstrated for selected benchmark problems. The availability of the proposed tool will bring the fidelity of modeling high speed flows of molecular gases to a next level and enable computational investigation of innovative concepts of plasma technologies for different applications.",
