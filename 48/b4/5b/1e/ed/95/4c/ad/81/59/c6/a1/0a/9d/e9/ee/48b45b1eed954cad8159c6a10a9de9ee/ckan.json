    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The MRIRN3IM data product consists of 4 x 5 inch photographic film sheets from the Nimbus-3 Medium Resolution Infrared Radiometer. Each film sheet contains an entire orbit (daylight portion) of data measured at five wavelength bands: 6.5-7.0, 10-11, 14.5-15.5, 5-30, and 0.2-4.0 micrometers. There are also associated latitude grids, time, and gray scales representing different temperatures. The images are saved as JPEG 2000 digital files. About 3 weeks of images are archived into a TAR file. The processing techniques used to produce the data set and a full description of the data set are contained in section 4 of the &quot;Nimbus III Users&apos; Guide.&quot; \n\nThe Nimbus 3 Medium-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (MRIR) experiment measured the intensity and distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by and reflected from the earth and its atmosphere in five selected wavelength intervals from 0.2 to 30 micrometers. Data for heat balance of the earth-atmosphere system were obtained, as well as measurements of water vapor distribution, surface or near-surface temperatures, and seasonal changes of stratospheric temperature distribution. The MRIR experiment obtained data from April 15 1969 until February 4, 1970.These images can be used to supplement the radiance data files from the MRIRN3L2 data product.",
