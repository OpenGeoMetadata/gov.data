    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NanoSonic proposes to develop an innovative, low-cost, ultra low mass\ndensity, and non-intrusive sensor system for ultra long duration\nballoons (ULDB) that will operate in the most extreme environmental\nconditions.  Specifically, the sensors would be integrated onto the load\nbearing seams and/or outer balloon mesh polyethylene surface of the\npressurized balloon system to accurately and continually measure axial\nloads.  Large axial load forces and extreme temperature ranges are\ntypical for scientific balloon missions; therefore a durable, flexible,\nand thermally stable sensor material is needed.  NanoSonic would use its\nhighly flexible, low-modulus Metal Rubber&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n                      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n (MR&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n) materials as strain/pressure sensors that are capable of large cyclic\ndeformation without failure.  MR&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n is a free-standing nanocomposite material produced by the\nlayer-by-layer combination of high performance polymers and\nelectrically-conducting metal nanoparticles that provide durability and\nrecoverability for sensor transduction, and a wide thermal operation\nrange.  Importantly, MR&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;\n can behave like a rubber band in that it can be folded / compressed for\nstowage and then can be deployed and continually pressurized without\nfailure.  Also, because of the very low amount of metallic nanoclusters\nin the system (&amp;lt;0.02 volume &amp;#37;), the sensor system is extremely\nlow-weight and would not alter the performance of the balloon.",
