    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) flux for the U.S. Upper Midwest at 0.5-degree resolution for the year 2007. Estimates were produced by two atmospheric CO2 inversion systems (top-down), referenced as the continental Colorado State University (CSU) inversion and the mesoscale Pennsylvania State University (PSU) inversion. This modeling work was performed in support of the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Mid-Continent Intensive (MCI) experimental campaign in the U.S. Upper Midwest designed to evaluate innovative methods for CO2 flux inversion and data assimilation. The experiment was performed over a relatively flat, heavily managed agricultural landscape which features a high density of atmospheric CO2 observation measurements. Among the CO2 observations used by the inversion systems were results from a network of instrumented tall towers in the region. The NEE estimates were produced for comparison with CO2 fluxes derived from bottom-up inventory estimates.There are five data files with this data set. The NEE estimates are provided in two NetCDF files, one for each inversion system. Boundary CO2 inflow data used by each inversion system are provided in three comma-separated-format files (.csv).",
