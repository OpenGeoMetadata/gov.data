    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "HyPerComp Engineering Inc. (HEI) and Utah State University (USU) propose to develop technology for lightweight composite materials for use in composite structures suitable for both cryogenic and damage tolerant environments. The proposed effort will incorporate previous work performed by HEI in the cryogenic performance of composite materials as well as previously developed improved impact technologies for micro-meteor/space debris survivability.  The application of filament wound composite pressure vessels in pressurized storage tanks at cryogenic temperatures has been undertaken at HEI and NASA MSFC with promising results.  Likewise, HEI has been conducting research and has patented, jointly with NASA MSFC, a robust impact resistant composite pressure vessel technology.  This technology shows great promise in its resistance to performance degradation from impacts, such as those that might be experienced in the space environment in the form of micrometeoroids and space debris.  Both of these technologies have been characterized for lightweight composite pressure vessels separately.  However, little if any understanding currently exists of their combined potential for both cryogenic and impact resistant composite structures applications, of those including, composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPV's).  The combination of the foregoing cryogenic technology with an impact resistant, robust composite pressure vessel technology would be studied.  Further, we believe, that combining these two technologies will provide a baseline technology from which to develop a dual-use composite structure.  This would be to ensure the integrity of the light weight composite structures, such as cryogenic fuel is stored in an orbiting depot, when exposed to the harsh environment a spacecraft will be expected to encounter during the life of its mission.",
