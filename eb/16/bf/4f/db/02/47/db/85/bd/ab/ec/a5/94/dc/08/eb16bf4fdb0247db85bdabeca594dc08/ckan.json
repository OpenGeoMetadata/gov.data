  "notes": " The Projectile Wash Out Facility is US Army Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE 1300). It is a pilot scale wash out facility that uses high pressure water and steam to washout and demil projectiles as large as 8 inch HE filled M106 projectiles. An APE 1300 production scale facility, identical to Picatinny&amp;#39;s equipment, is located at Bluegrass Army Depot. In addition to the Projectile Wash Out Facility, there is a Pink Water Treatment Facility. The pink water treatment equipment is utilized to process all contaminated water wastes from the 200, 600 and 800 Areas at Picatinny.   The Autoclave Demil System was designed and developed by ARDEC. A large scale autoclave system was designed, built and installed based on the ARDEC design and was used to reclaim approximately 10.5 million pounds of TNT which was later used in the production of new bombs for the Air Force. The fully functional prototype system can be used to demil 60mm, 81mm, 120mm, and 155mm projectiles. The system is also used to demil projectiles received from onsite EOD personnel. This includes foreign munitions recently removed from Southwest Asia. Projectiles demilled in the autoclave are sent to Bldg 800 to be thermally decontaminated to 5X status. Explosives drained from the projectiles are captured in a 25-gallon Melt Kettle where the composition of the material can be analyzed utilizing Near Infrared (NIR) Compositional Analysis System.  ",
