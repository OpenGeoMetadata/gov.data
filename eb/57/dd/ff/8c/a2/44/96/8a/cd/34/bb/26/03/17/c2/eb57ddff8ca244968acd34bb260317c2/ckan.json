    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Rocket plume impingement may cause significant damage and contaminate\nco-landed spacecraft and surrounding habitat structures during Lunar\nlanding operations. Under this proposed SBIR program, CFDRC and the\nUniversity of Florida will develop an innovative high-fidelity\nsimulation system for predicting surface erosion and debris transport\ncaused by rocket plume impingement on lunar surface. This simulation\nsystem will combine 1) a unified continuum-rarefied flow solver capable\nof simulating plume impingement flow in lunar vacuum, 2) granular flow\nsolid-fluid interaction technology for developing lunar soil grain\nerosion and debris particle release mechanism models, and 3) particle\ntracking tools to simulate debris kinetics, dispersion and contamination\nafter liberation. In Phase I, the plume stagnation layer flow conditions\nat the soil surface will be modeled and computed. The solid-fluid\ninteraction physics in the soil layer in response to this surface flow\nenvironment will be simulated and a generalized soil erosion model will\nbe derived. The erosion model will then serve to prescribe debris mass\nand initial conditions for the debris-tracking module embedded in the\nflow solver. In Phase II, the individual modules will be combined into a\nsingle simulation system. The simulation system will be essential for\npredicting the severity and range of dust and debris transport and for\ndesigning lunar settlement layout, dust and debris impact mitigation\nmeasures. He will spend at least 35 &amp;#37; of his time on this project and\nhis commitment to other projects is less than 50 &amp;#37;.",
