    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop a versatile and affordable system to measure the average diameter of primary soot particles along with their mass concentration in aircraft engine exhausts. This work will expand upon our recent experience applying laser-induced incandescence (LII) to obtain the first successful quantitative measurements of spatially and temporally resolved, non-intrusive soot particle mass concentration in an aircraft engine test. The proposed system will take advantage of recent research suggesting that particle size can be obtained from the LII decay rate. Advances in laser and photodiode technology should enable compact, inexpensive components to be used. A simple calibration procedure will help minimize the requirements for operator expertise and training. Advanced, experimentally validated algorithms will be used to compute soot particle size and mass, with the results displayed in real time during an engine test. The tasks described in this proposal are essential steps leading to a versatile LII system that can be routinely applied to engine testing programs, and subsequently commercialized. Our goal is to develop an LII system suitable for widespread use; therefore, it will be portable, inexpensive, and easy to operate. The proposed Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of this system.",
