      "description": "A File Geodatabase data source, Web Mercator projection map service on the www that depicts the area of activities funded through BDBD and PPPP budget line item and reported through the FACTS database. The objective of the BD Program is to dispose of unwanted slash or other debris created by timber purchaser operations on timber sale contracts, stewardship contracts and permits, not disposed of by the purchaser. Activities are self-reported by Forest Service Units. The Brush Disposal Program (BD) objective of the BD Program was established in 1916. It requires all purchasers of National Forest timber make deposits to the United States for the estimated cost of disposing of brush and other debris resulting from its cutting operations. Brush disposal activities must be consistent with direction established in forest land and resource management plans, identified in environmental documents developed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). This layer represents select activities accomplished as a part of the brush disposal program of work. It is important to note that this layer does not contain all activities funded through BDBD because the spatial portion of the activity description is not required and is self-reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data is a new requirement for brush disposal activities, we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of this data in coming years. ",
