    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "It is proposed to advance manufacturing science and technology to improve yield and optical surface figure in high actuator count, high-resolution deformable mirrors (DM) required for wavefront control in space-based high contrast imaging instruments. As the scale of batch fabricated, polysilicon surface micromachined MEMS DMs increases to thousands of actuators the associated increase in devices size limits the achievable yield due to micro-scale defects introduced during the manufacturing processes and large unpowered surface figure errors. In Phase I research, major obstacles preventing scalability of microfabrication processes to large arrays will be overcome by developing a polysilicon deposition process to reduce and control defect density to maximize the yield of a 1027 segment Tip-Tilt Piston DM with 3081 actuators and to determine the practical limits of the tool set and compatibility of this process for the manufacture of MEMS DMs with &gt;104 actuators. Manufacturing processes to minimize unpowered surface figure errors will be developed to (1) reduce substrate curvature induced DM surface figure errors through control of deposition and polishing processes to balance the front and backside film thickness, and (2) reduce polishing induced DM surface figure errors by modifying the device wire routing layout design to maintain uniform pattern density across the device area to achieve uniform material removal rates in the polishing process. Successful completion of the Phase 1 work will enable the design and manufacture of a 1027 Tip-Tilt-Piston deformable mirror required for NASA's visible nulling coronagraph instrument in a Phase 2 effort.",
