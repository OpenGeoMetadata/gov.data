  "notes": "The goal of this project was to develop maps of the original vegetation and original fireregimes of the Grand Bay-Old Field Bay-Banks Lake wetland complex to provide a background fordecisions around restoration and land management. Rather than mapping existing vegetation, the intentwas to produce the best approximation of the natural vegetation that existed at time of first Europeansettlement. This is the vegetation that dominated the landscape prior to 1820 and for some 6,000 yearsbefore. Understanding original vegetation is essential to restoring habitats and managing lands forperpetuation of rare species, natural vegetation communities, and for the full range of animal and plantspecies that depend upon them for habitat. Nearly all the upland original vegetation of the natural area was in some way structured by fire. About 65% of rare native plants and animals in the South are in some way dependent upon fire to create or maintain their habitat. Since the site contains a number of these species and habitats for some species now extirpated, the GIS layers can serve as base maps for guidance in protecting endangered species and wildlife habitats. They can also serve as a guide to managing and restoring examples of the longleaf pine ecosystem, canebrakes, bay-galls, swamps and the other natural vegetation communities and wildlife habitats originally present. A new mapping method using landscape fire ecology was used to reconstruct presettlement fire frequency (Map 1) and presettlement vegetation (Map 2). This involved field sampling of the best remnant vegetation on each of the 26 soil series shown on the portions of the two county soil maps that cover the area; compilation of historical information relating to vegetation; characterizing fire effects in each kind of vegetation on each soil series; mapping regional and local fire compartments; and identification of fire-frequency indicator species and firefrequency indicator plant communities. Soil series were then used to put boundaries on vegetation types. Data collected from several hundred plots during previous work at other sites in the mid-Atlantic region were used in interpreting vegetation. Descriptions were prepared of the original vegetation types of the natural area as they occurred on each soil series. The presettlement vegetation method used here is expected to have application throughout the South and in other landscapes where frequent fire was an important determinant of vegetation in presettlement times. Forestry staff at Moody Air Force base and the Georgia DNR Division of Wildlife Resources have begun a program of management for natural forest types, and for restoring natural processes such as fire. Using the maps as guides for habitat restoration, the cooperating agencies should be able to establish management policies that will meet national defense, wildlife, recreation and other management objectives while restoring natural fire regimes and maintaining examples of the full range of rich natural communities that the area first encompassed. Grand Bay itself was found to be unique among the wetlands of the natural area, being a true clay-based Carolina bay, with its flat basin perched above the rest of the bays and originally supporting extensive graminoid zones with scattered slash pine maintained by frequent fire.",
