    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Access to space for Small Satellites is enabled by the use of excess launch capacity. An integration process that minimizes risk to the primary, allows parallel integration and predictable cost/schedule for the secondary enables use of that capacity. Design_Net has developed and flown a Falcon 1 RideShare Adapter (RSA)  and is developing  a RSA for the Minotaur IV, EELVs and Falcon 9. An RSA is more than structure, it must have electronics to provide a single simple interface to the launch vehicle (constant from mission to mission), yet provide a standard set of services to Payloads.  DNet has leveraged work on the Falcon RSA, work on advanced AFRL Plug and Play avionics and commercial investments to develop a modular Secondary Payload Support Unit (SPSU). SPSU provides deployment, power distribution, and telemetry services for secondaries. We propose building on that work by adding video capability to verify and evaluate payload deployment.  During Phase 1 we develop the video to PDR level (Begin TRL 3; End TRL 4) and during Phase 2 carry development of that module coupled with the rest of the SPSU (currently at TRL 6) to TRL 8 and have a system ready for flight in  2012 timeframe.
