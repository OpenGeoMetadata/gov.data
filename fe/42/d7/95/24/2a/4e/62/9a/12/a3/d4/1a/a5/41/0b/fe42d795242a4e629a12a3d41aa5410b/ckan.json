  "notes": "Studies were conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1986 and 1988 to obtain trace element and water quality data on water, sediments, and fish in rivers of the Koyukuk and Innoko Refuges and to assess the impacts of upstream placer and hard rock mining activities. This report only addresses data obtained in the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge and the Northern Unit of the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, currently under management by Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge staff. Valuable baseline water quality and contaminants data were obtained for performing before/after comparisons should mining resume on the drainages sampled. Study sites resembled many other nonglacial interior Alaska streams and rivers -- slightly acid to moderately basic in pH, soft to moderate in hardness, and low to average in alkalinity. All sites except the Hogatza River and the Koyukuk River had low turbidities for rivers. Measurable settlable solids were observed in the Koyukuk River and in Caribou Creek, and comparatively high suspended solids were measured in the Hogatza River, Koyukuk River, and Caribou Creek in 1987. Caribou Creek's turbidity was only slightly elevated and Clear Creek was very low in turbidity, indicating that the source of turbidity on the Hogatza River was being derived from other sources at the time of sampling, and not directly from these formerly mined streams. The comparatively high turbidity, settleable solids, and suspended of these rivers in 1987 was not observed in 1988, suggesting that the higher turbidity may occur episodically, following flood events. With a few notable exceptions, surface waters examined in this study were relatively uncontaminated by metals. Vanadium concentrations in refuge surface waters were observed only in 1986 in single grab samples and appear elevated (> 0.01 mg/L) at the Hogatza River, Bishop Creek, and the Gisasa River. Other metals elevated in water are iron, manganese, copper, and nickel. Sufficient northern pike were obtained for trace element analysis and statistical treatment from all study sites except Clear Creek, where only Arctic grayling were obtained. Barium, cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium were present in some fish livers, while copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, tin and zinc were present in all fish livers. The relationship between fish growth and site was also investigated. No significant differences in northern pike length, weight, or condition index occurred among sites. Also, correlations between northern pike length, weight, and condition index and trace element concentrations, when observed, appeared weak and unlikely to strongly influence fish growth or condition. One unfortunate casualty of our quality control/quality assurance screening was mercury in all three media -- water, sediments, and fish tissues. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that, according to analytical results, mercury was present in fish muscle tissue, as well as other tissues, sometimes at concentrations probably equally to or greater than 1 mg/kg wet weight. Concern therefore remains that certain watersheds on these refuges contain mercury contaminated fish that present a possible health hazard to fish, wildlife, and subsistence users, particularly if use of northern pike is frequent in areas where mercury concentrations are high. Until quality data are obtained for mercury and source areas of mercury are better defined, the amount of risk from mercury in fish from these watersheds remains uncertain.",
