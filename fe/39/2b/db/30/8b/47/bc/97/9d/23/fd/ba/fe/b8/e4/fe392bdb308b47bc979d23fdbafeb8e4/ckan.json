    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed innovation is a simple, robust, sensor array for the detection of laminar/turbulent transition location, areas of flowfield separation, and shock wave locations.  The system can be used in both ground and flight test facilities.  The proposed system uses a very robust and proven sensor technology combined with a novel mounting and manufacturing technique.  The sensor array is reusable and can be produced in a configuration that requires no external power, acquisition or viewing, for flight test applications.  The system combines an array of small, surface flush, sensors embedded in an extremely thin, flexible polyimide strip.  The system operates by sensing changes in local heat transfer within the boundary-layer.  Variations in heat transfer coefficients due to the state of the boundary layer (laminar, transitional, turbulent, separated regions) produce changes in the sensor output.  Other flowfield features where heat transfer is affected will also be discernable, such as shock waves.  The flush mounted sensors, embedded in a smooth, thin polyimide sheet, conform to the local surface contour and produce minimal aerodynamic interference, allowing non-intrusive measurements.  The system will be quantitatively accurate across the low-speed through supersonic flow regime.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Compared to current systems designed for similar measurements, the proposed system promises to provide a significantly more robust and efficient system in a relatively simple, cost effective package.",
