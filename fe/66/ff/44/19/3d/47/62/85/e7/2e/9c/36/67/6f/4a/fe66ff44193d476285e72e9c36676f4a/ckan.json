    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "RTI will design and optimize an 80 W, 77K cryocooler based on the reverse turbo Brayton cycle (RTBC) with four identical coldheads for distributed cooling. Based on preliminary analysis, the single centrifugal compressor with integrated motor will be 10 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length, and rotate at about 100,000 rpm. Each coldhead (consisting of a recuperative heat exchanger, turbo-expander and cold side heat exchanger) is expected to be about 6X6X15 cm in linear dimensions, and weighs about 0.2 kg. Key technical innovations are superior aerodynamics for a compact, reliable and efficient compressor, distributed RTBC cryocooling with a single compressor, and techniques to drastically minimize performance-degrading axial conduction in recuperative heat exchangers. Microfabrication is a key enabler for implementation of this concept. Phase I will involve system design, and design and fabrication of the compressor. The Phase II goal is to integrate the compressor with motor, electronics and gas foil bearings with a target isentropic efficiency of 80&#37; at a pressure ratio of 1.75. It is expected that the coefficient of performance of the overall RTBC system when completed would be at least 0.12, with the minimum and maximum cycle temperature being 64 K and 440 K respectively.
