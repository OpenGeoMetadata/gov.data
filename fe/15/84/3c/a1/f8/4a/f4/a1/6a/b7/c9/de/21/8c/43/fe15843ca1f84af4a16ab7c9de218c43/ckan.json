    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The lecture of the [Stanford-IVHM lecture series](https://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/group/stanford-ivhm-lecture-series/)  will give an overview of the approaches in building diagnostic solutions for networks and complex systems. The conventional rule-based approach and the top-down analysis will be compared with other innovative solutions based on information modeling and codebook correlation. One specific solution pioneered by research done in Columbia University and later implemented by SMARTS/EMC  will be presented in more detail as an example of a consistent approach to diagnostics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpeaker:\r\n\r\nYuri Rabover, Ph.D. VMTurbo\r\n\r\nDr. Yuri Rabover, is a co-founder and Director of Product Strategy of VMTurbo, a startup in a stealth mode. Prior to VMTurbo Yuri spent 12 years working for SMARTS as director of engineering, product management and technology partnership. After EMC acquired SMARTS for $275M in 2005, Yuri was managing the Advanced Solution Group in the EMC Corporate CTO Office developing prototypes and proof of concepts of new innovative solutions. He is a seasoned technologist, strategist and researcher in the wide area of system, network and storage management with more than 20 years of industry and academia experience.  ",
