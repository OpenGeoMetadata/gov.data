  "notes": "The Lower Souris Migratory Waterfowl Refuge (now known as the J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge) is located just south of the Canadian border in North Dakota. The refuge was established and constructed by the CCC in 1935 to restore waterfowl habitat. This report gives an overview of events taking place on the refuge in August, September and October of 1938. One of the driest spells that has ever occurred on the refuge occurred from the middle of July to the middle of October. Water released from the Upper Souris in July proved to be insufficient to compensate for evaporation. The fall migration has quite closely followed the pattern of previous years. The surplus of grasshoppers has contributed hundreds of thousands of bushels of grain to wildlife. The hunting season was very successful and there are still a large number of birds left. Bird banding operations have continued and over four hundred birds have been banded. Work on building the boundary fence has progressed and is completed on all lands that are paid for. It will be at least three years before the fencing will be complete. Many other development projects took place on the refuge such as dam construction, a telephone line installment and patrol road construction. In addition, there were plantings, crop cultivation, seed collection and distribution, haying and share cropping. The narrative concludes with a photographs section.",
