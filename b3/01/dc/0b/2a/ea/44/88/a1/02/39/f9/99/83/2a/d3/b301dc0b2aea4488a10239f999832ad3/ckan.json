    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA space exploration projects require avionic systems, components, and controllers that are capable of operating in the extreme temperature and radiation environments of deep space. To design wide-temperature radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics and predict characteristics and reliability in space, advanced models and simulation tools are required at multiple levels. Analog and mixed-signal circuits for space have not been adequately addressed so far. This project aims to design, develop, validate, and demonstrate novel Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) aimed for the extreme environments of space. In Phase 1, CFDRC in collaboration with Georgia Tech will: (1) enhance and demonstrate the CFDRC's unique physics-based mixed-mode simulation tools (NanoTCAD coupled with Cadence Spectre) for predicting extreme-wide-temperature and transient radiation response of analog/mixed-signal ICs based on silicon-germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS technologies; (2) perform first-ever mixed-mode simulation-based investigation of single-event effects (SEE) in SiGe analog, mixed-signal, and radio-frequency (RF) circuits in wide temperature range, and provide important understanding of currently unexplained physical phenomena behind the experimental radiation/temperature data collected under the NASA Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP); and (3) develop preliminary RHBD concepts for SEE hardening. In Phase 2, we will demonstrate and validate the improved physics-based models for temperature range from -230&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C to +130&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C, and apply them to evaluate and develop RHBD designs over the expected operating range. New RHBD devices and analog circuits will be fabricated in prototype chips and tested at wide temperatures and radiation, and delivered as a component library to NASA. \r\n\r\n",
