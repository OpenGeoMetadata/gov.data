  "notes": " FUNCTION: Determines the effectiveness of ship-based IR decoys and IR laser countermeasure (CM) systems against IR-guided antiship missiles (ASM). Develops performance bounds of IR ASMs to detect and engage both conventional and signature-reduced U.S. surface platforms. Evaluates the performance of various infrared countermeasure (IRCM) techniques. DESCRIPTION: The IR Missile Simulator and Development Laboratory includes IR seeker simulators and a fully equipped laboratory for sensor evaluation, processor design and development, flight hardware assembly, algorithm design, and data analysis. The aircraftmounted systems use fiber-optic communications between the wing pod and the instrumentation/display inside the aircraft. This provides low noise on all data channels. The simulator systems contain an integrated data system for analysis of extensive field trials and allow ready visualization of both the actual tests and post-test data reduction. One simulator is a reprogrammable system permitting evaluation of multiple threats. Detector configurations and algorithms are changed to properly represent the threats. A separate flyable simulator supports research on imaging IR seekers. The large system gimbal accommodates newly developed imaging IR cameras. By using flexible software architecture, a complete missile seeker system with exceptional ability to incorporate new algorithms and infrared counter-countermeasure (IRCCM) approaches is obtained. Digital data collection allows post-test analysis, system development, and simulation. INSTRUMENTATION: An extensive array of optical and electronic analysis equipment supports the development, test, and operation of the electro-optical (EO)/IR simulators. Test and analysis of much of the electronics are accomplished through custom interfaces coupled to portable computer-based data acquisition subsystems. Software development facilities are a major feature of the simulators, which use both high-level and assembly-level code for real-time operations. A high-performance emulation environment makes development of this complex code possible.  ",
