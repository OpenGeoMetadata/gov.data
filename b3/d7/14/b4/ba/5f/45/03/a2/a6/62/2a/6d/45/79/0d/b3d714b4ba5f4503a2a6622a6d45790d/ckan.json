    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We will design and implement an interface between the Paramesh computational libraries, developed and used by groups at NASA GSFC, and the Cactus computational framework, developed primarily by scientists at Louisiana State University, the RI on this proposal.  Our innovation falls in the domain of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), a technique to focus computational resources in regions of small scale dynamics.  Our approach is innovative as it brings together one of the leading AMR packages (Paramesh) with Cactus, a widely used modular, parallel problem solving environment that is supported on multiple computing architectures.  Our innovative proposal responds specifically the to the \"Computing\" subtopic in the solicitation in three areas:  It will (1) reduce costs for current Paramesh users at Goddard, by providing access to the wide variety of validated tools already available through Cactus and which would otherwise need to be redeveloped at NASA; (2) facilitate sharing of novel algorithms between Paramesh and Cactus users worldwide through the existing and proven interoperability features provided by Cactus; and (3) position Paramesh users to benefit from the many next-generation computer science innovations that are actively researched by the core Cactus development team (such as grid computing) and other Cactus contributors.",
