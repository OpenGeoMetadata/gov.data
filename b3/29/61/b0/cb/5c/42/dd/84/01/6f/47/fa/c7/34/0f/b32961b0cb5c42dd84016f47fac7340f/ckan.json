  "notes": " The definition of Information Assurance (IA) Technology is &amp;quot;Information Operations that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. IA implies the ability to protect, detect, and successfully react to information attacks directed at the United States especially when it comes to our military infrastructure.&amp;quot; IA takes the principles of Electronic Warfare and extends them to computer and software based systems to find vulnerabilities and susceptibilities, which could be exploited.   The Information Assurance (IA) Test Facility mission is to ensure that our Integrated system and System of System (SoS) test process provides an effective and efficient IA test &amp;amp; evaluation (T&amp;amp;E) methodology for military weapon systems that include information technology (IT) items. SoS refers to a total network composed of all the interconnected computer systems, communications systems, and network components within some logical boundary, such as a division&amp;#39;s control or the boundaries of an exercise/experiment. The IA T&amp;amp;E methodology applies throughout the life cycle phases of any Department of Defense (DoD) system that collects, stores, transmits, or processes classified and/or sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information, as well as commercial systems. The IA T&amp;amp;E methodology provides much of the essential vulnerability information by fulfilling the IA requirements with the following regulations, pamphlets and instructions:    Army Regulation 380-19 Army Regulation 25-IA Army Regulation 380-53 DOD PAM 25-IA DODI 5200.40 - Department of Defense IT Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP)  ",
