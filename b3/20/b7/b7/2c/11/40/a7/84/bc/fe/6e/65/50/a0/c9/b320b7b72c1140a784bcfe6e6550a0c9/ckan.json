  "notes": "Weather conditions for the year were near normal and had no significant effect on refuge outputs or operations. Stillwater Wildlife Management Area was plagued with a shortage of water during the entire reporting period. July storage in Stillwater Point Reservoir was rapidly depleted, resulting in below optimum levels in most impoundments. By the end of August, four units were completely dry and the reservoir nearly drained. The remaining units were considerably below desired operating levels. By October, five impoundments were dry. The supply of water continued to decline during the last half of the reporting period. At the end of June, the situation was becoming critical with seven impoundments dry and further curtailment of water anticipated. The Fiscal Year net water receipts for the Area totaled 52,612 feet – far short of the marsh’s requirement of 91,377 acre feet. Generally, marsh conditions deteriorated due to an inadequate water supply. With smaller water receipts, salinity levels increased above desired parameters in most impoundments. The increased production of moderately salt tolerant muskgrass appears to verify the rise in salinity. The lowest and highest salt tolerant plant species, 1.e., sago pondweed and widgeongrass, were about the same as last year in frequency of occurrence. In September, during peak bird use, the acreage of marsh and water habitat was near its lowest level. Only 11,700 acres of wetlands habitat remained out of a possible 21,900 acres. This was 53% of the maximum potential for wetlands habitat. The habitat acreage increased slightly during the winter due to increased water receipts and lower evaporation rates. At the beginning of the irrigation season in March, approximately 12,000 acres of wetland habitat were in operation. But by the end of June, with seven impoundments already dry and the hottest months of July and August looming ominously ahead, the wetlands had shrunk to 11,300 acres—or 52% of the maximum possible.",
