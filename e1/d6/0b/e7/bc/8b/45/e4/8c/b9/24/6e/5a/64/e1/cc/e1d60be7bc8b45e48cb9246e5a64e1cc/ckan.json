    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

The project: An experienced NMSG Grad student is performing modal waveform frequency analysis to identify progressive damage and by COTs and custom software (e.g., WSTF/GRC Acoustic Emission Analysis Applet and WSTF FRAT).&amp;nbsp; Utilizes new AE equipment and labor from separately funded NASA interns for more productivity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tFY13 Hardware and Software Progress&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tIdentified NI and AE vendor components for a proof of concept system&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tProof of concept hardware has been procured and is currently capable of viewing AE data on 8 individual channels&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tA combination of a Digital Wave FM-1 signal conditioner and B-1025 AE sensors are used&amp;nbsp; in conjunction with a NI PXI system to collect data&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tNI LabView is used to view AE data but is currently not capable of recording multiple waveforms&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tDevelopment of program capable of recording all waveforms is currently under development&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tSoftware is still not capable of recording parametric data but hardware is now in the PXI system to do so&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tFY13 Acoustic Emission Analysis Applet Software Work Completed for Smart COPV (excluding bug fixes):&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tAdded Partial Energies vs. Time plot (right-click option on Partial Power Fractionsvs. Time plot)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tAdded Bar Graph Analysis window (right-click option on Partial Power Fractions vs.Time plot)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\tAdded run-time menu item in AE Stats vs. Event Time Plots right-click menu window to spawn dialog for entering cursor bounds over which to perform curve fit.
