  "notes": "Trace element concentrations in sediment samples are shown in Table 2. Sediments from a wetland receiving oilfield produced water from the Arnell oil production site were moderately polluted with nickel and heavily polluted with zinc. Sediments from a wetland receiving oilfield produced water from the Mahoney oil production site in Carbon County were heavily polluted with barium. Sediments from a production site in Natrona County were moderately to heavily polluted with arsenic and barium. Aliphatic Hydrocarbons Differentiating petrogenic from biogenic compounds in the interpretation of hydrocarbon residues in sediments and biota is important. Petrogenic compounds have approximately equal proportions of odd- and even-numbered aliphatics (Hall and Coon 1988). Also, high ratios of pristane and phytane to nC17 and nC18, respectively, indicate recent or chronic exposure to petroleum compounds (Anderson et al. 1978, Farrington et al. 1973, Hall and Coon 1988). The Carbon Preference Index (CPI) is also used to differentiate between oiled and non-oiled matrices (Farrington a Tripp 1977). Sediments collected immediately downstream of the discharges at the Little Laramie and Pilot Butte had almost equal proportions of odd- and even-numbered aliphatics (Table 3)suggesting recent or chronic exposure to petroleum compounds. CPI values for sediments from the discharges at the Little Laramie and Pilot Butte ranged from 1.08 to 1.22. CPI values less than 3 indicate oiled sediments (Farrington and Tripp 1977). CPI values from ponds downstream from the discharges were greater than 3. Aliphatic hydrocarbon concentrations from sediments are shown in Table 4. Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAH's detected in the sediments from the UNOCAL site included benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, chrysene, and indeno(1,2,3- cd)pyrene (Table 5). Benzo(a)pyrene and chrysene have been shown to induce embryotoxicity in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Based on topical applications to eggs, 0.036 x 10-3 ug benzo(a)pyrene/g and 0.273 x 10-3 ug chrysene/g caused deformities, growth reductions, and mortality (Hoffman and Gay 1981, as cited in Eisler)1987). In doses of 2.0 mg/kg/egg, benzo(a)pyrene and indeno(1,2,3- cd)pyrene severely decreased survival while chrysene caused a significant increase in lesions in embryos from common eider and domestic chicken, turkey, and duck (Brunstrom et al., 1990). Levels of the PAH's (benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, chrysene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene) were lower in sediments from the UNOCAL discharge than in the sediments from the downstream marsh and pond receiving the effluent. Total hydrocarbons in sediments were higher at the discharge than in the wetland and lower in the pond than in the marsh. At the Albany and Fremont county sites total hydrocarbons and oil and grease were also higher in sediments from the discharge outfalls than in the receiving wetlands. Sediment samples from all sites had high concentrations of oil and grease (Table 6).",
