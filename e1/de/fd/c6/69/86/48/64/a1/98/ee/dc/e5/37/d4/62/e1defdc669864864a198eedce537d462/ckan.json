    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "MetroLaser proposes to design and develop an innovative narrowband tunable IR filter based on the properties of a one-dimensional photonic crystal structure with a resonant cavity. Such structure would exhibit an ultra-narrow, high-throughput band in the middle of a wide, low-transmission stop-band. During Phase I, through an extensive and detailed analysis, we performed a feasibility study to establish the operational characteristics and performance of the proposed tunable filter. Following this, we assembled and tested a breadboard and demonstrated filter tunability over 4 cm 1 with bandpass close to 0.25 cm-1, rejection level better than 23 dB, and acceptance angle of about 1 degree at 10.6 microns. The acquired data demonstrated our optimal approach for designing and constructing an ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter. During Phase II, we will design, build, deliver to NASA, and perform field testing of a compact and robust prototype module of a 1\" diameter narrowband filter with a tunability range of 10 cm-1, a bandpass range of 0.1 cm-1, background rejection of 30 dB, and transmittance better than 50&#37;. A rugged and monolithic filter design will allow this instrument to be incorporated in air- or space-based platforms providing stable performance in harsh operating environments.",
