    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In response to NASA's need for a 3D virtual reality environment providing scientific data visualization without special user devices, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a new Holographic Image Plane Projection Integral (HIPPI) 3D display that projects real moving (video rate) 3D color images in air.  These 3D images will appear to a viewer as real, opaque (hidden line obscuration), volumetric 3D images over a wide look-around field-of-view (180 to 360 deg.) with high-fidelity realism.  The proposed HIPPI-3D display consists of a high-speed, high-resolution, full-color projector, a spinning beam scanner, beam-forming optics, and a lightweight, transparent, spatially multiplexed (thin strip) off-axis reflective holographic projection screen.  By projecting 2D perspective views of a 3D object, via the strip hologram, and by scanning multiple strips at 30 Hz, a multiplanar integral volume 3D image is created in the air in front of the curved screen.  The screen and the projector can be set up and disassembled very quickly.  In Phase I, POC will conduct a detailed feasibility study by analytical design supported by experimental verification, and a proof-of-concept demonstration setup.  Phase II will focus on optimizing the system design and component technologies to complete a fully operational prototype.",
