  "notes": " The purpose of the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) Advanced Internet Protocol (IP) Technology Laboratory is to assist the Department of Defense (DOD) successfully migrate to IPv6 while maintaining existing IPv4 interoperability. DOD has tasked the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), JITC&amp;#39;s parent command, to ensure that DOD IPv6 fielding is coordinated, does not duplicate efforts within DOD and does not introduce interoperability and information assurance risks. DISA will acquire, manage, allocate, and control necessary IPv6 address space for the DOD. DISA and the Joint Staff, with participation of DOD components and Services, is developing a transition plan leading to full IPv6 implementation by FY 08. Since it has the capability to replicate most strategic and tactical joint architectures, JITC, as the information technology and national security systems testing and certification arm of the DOD/DISA, established the Advanced IP Technology Laboratory. In the Lab, Program Managers, acquisition agents and vendors are provided a matrix of equipment and operating systems to conduct IPv6 research, development, testing and evaluation during joint and combined exercises. Access to the laboratory has encouraged vendors to incorporate interoperability in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 involving general military applications. As DOD&amp;#39;s sole interoperability certification authority, JITC tests all DOD information technology and national security systems for interoperability. Since it has the capability to replicate most strategic and tactical joint architectures, JITC, as the certification arm of the DOD, established the Advanced IP Technology Laboratory. In the laboratory, Program Managers, acquisition agents and vendors are provided a matrix of equipment and operating systems to conduct IP research, development, testing and evaluation in both US-only and coalition architectures. Access to the laboratory has encouraged vendors to incorporate interoperability in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 involving general military applications.  ",
