    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this NASA SBIR Phase I proposal we propose to apply a highly conformal coating of ZnO and AlN or a double layer of GaN to the surface and internal pore walls of conventional microchannel plates (MCP). This will lead to enhanced secondary electron emission (SEE) and, thus, improve MCP gain for UV /X-ray detectors. The ZnO/ALN(GaN) hetrostructure using nano ZnO needles as templates has been demonstrated to exhibit significantly higher SEE yield for electrons, ions and X-ray beams. The coatings will be carrid out by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The key advantages of ALD include 1)super conformity of coatings and nearly 100&#37; step coverage on very high aspect ratio substrates, which is well suited for coating highly porous MCP wafers with a aspect ration ~100; 2)super thickness and composition control; 3)continuous and pin hole free quality films; and 4) easy to scale up for large area deposition at low cost. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time the advanced ALD process has been proposed as a way of improving UV detector performance of MCPS. If successful, this technology will provide an effective  method of modifing the MCP surfaces by coating  them with high SEE yield films that will dramatically improve the gain of conventional MCPs. This will enhance the performance of UV detectors required for various NASA missions. ",
