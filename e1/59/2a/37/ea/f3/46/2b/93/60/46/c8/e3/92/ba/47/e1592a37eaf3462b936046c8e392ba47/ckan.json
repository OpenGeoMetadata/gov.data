  "notes": " The DST3 enables research, development, and prototyping of next-generation training technologies for the Army and Joint forces dismounted Soldier training communities. Researchers experiment with immersive-related technologies that support an integrated and realistic virtual, constructive training environment. Efforts focus on mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality immersive technologies, after-action reviews, artificial intelligence, virtual humans, odor technologies, and non-verbal communications that include gesture, gesture recognition, motion capture, and animation capabilities. DST3 houses a full infantry squad complement of virtual immersive man-wearable simulation systems and man-wearable mixed reality and augmented reality prototypes. The prototypes include integrated locomotion devices, head-mounted display technologies, integrated pose and posture tracking equipment, and integrated game-engine environments. The modular design of these prototypes permits plug-and-play of the latest technology innovations and development of baseline capabilities for dismounted Soldier use. Collaborative research uses the Call for Fire Trainer augmented virtual reality simulation, which is a prototype immersive, high fidelity training system.  ",
