    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tWe propose here to develop the &lt;em&gt;Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;GRIPS&lt;/em&gt;), the next-generation instrument for high-energy solar observations. &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;will provide a nearoptimal combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of solar-flare gamma-ray/hard X-ray emissions from ~20 keV to &amp;gt;~10 MeV (see Table 1). The key new technology (already developed for non-solar astrophysics by collaborator Steven Boggs) is that of a 3D position-sensitive germanium detector (3D-GeD) that allows the position and energy deposition of every photon interaction to be recorded individually, even within the same detector. With the 3D-GeDs, &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;can use a new single-grid imaging system, called the Multi- Pitch Rotating Modulator (MPRM), that provides a near-ideal point response function with twice the throughput per cm2 of detector area compared to the rotating modulation collimator (RMC) imaging of &lt;em&gt;RHESSI&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, since Compton scattering (the dominant interaction at &amp;gt;~150 keV) of the incident photons can be tracked by the 3D-GeDs, much of the background can be rejected and the polarization of photons can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe proposed balloon-borne &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;consists of a Spectrometer/Polarimeter with sixteen 3DGeDs in four stacked 2_2 planes, together with a single rotating MPRM grid placed 8 meters away, to provide a full-Sun field-of-view and angular resolution (12.5-arcsec FWHM at gamma ray energies) sufficient to separate the footpoints of 2.2 MeV sources for almost all flares.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe spacecraft-borne version of &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;is envisioned to have sixty-four 3D-GeDs in four stacked 4_4 planes, together with a single grid ~20 meters away, in a spinning spacecraft. Such a space &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;would provide a tremendous leap forward for high-energy solar physics, with order of magnitude increases in effective area for gamma-ray line (and hard X-ray) imaging, and much better angular resolution and image quality (see Table 1). A space &lt;em&gt;GRIPS &lt;/em&gt;will allow the 0.511 MeV positron-annihilation line and the weaker prompt nuclear de-excitation lines to be imaged for the first time. Together with line shifts and shapes from the simultaneous high-resolution spectroscopy, such an instrument will provide powerful new diagnostics of the flare energy release and particle acceleration process. Furthermore, precise polarization measurements would be obtained for the first time to constrain models and determine beaming of energetic electrons.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
