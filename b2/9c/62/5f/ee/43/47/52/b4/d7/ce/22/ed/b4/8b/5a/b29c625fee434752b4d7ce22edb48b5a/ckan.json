  "notes": "More than 1,400 individual Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) with beak deformities were recorded in south-central Alaska between 1991 and 2005. Over 200 individuals of 27 other species of birds were also recorded in Alaska with similar beak deformities. Five deformed adult chickadees were sent to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for necropsy, histopathological examination, and viral testing in comparison to two normal adults. There was no evidence of disease, parasites, or chronic vitamin or mineral deficiency relating to the deformities. Analysis of blood samples using flow cytometry suggested that adults with deformed beaks had higher rates of chromosomal damage than adults with normal beaks. In 1999 a study was initiated to determine the prevalence of beak deformities among Black-capped Chickadees in south-central Alaska, determine at what age the deformities were developing, and investigate contaminants as a potential cause of the deformities. Among 1,820 12-day-old nestling chickadees examined, only 0.05% had a crossed beak; an additional 0.6% had slight maxillary overgrowth of the keratin sheath. Thirty-six adult chickadees, 49 nestlings, and 39 eggs were screened for metals, trace elements, and organochlorine compounds to determine if there was an association between beak deformities or hatchability and any of the contaminants. Concentrations of heavy metals, other potentially toxic elements, and methylmercury were all below levels of concern. There was no association between selenium, any other element, or methylmercury and the presence or absence of beak deformities in adult chickadees. There was no support for selenium as the cause for beak deformities among chickadees. We propose to test the hypothesis experimentally that low levels of PCBs contribute to beak deformities.",
