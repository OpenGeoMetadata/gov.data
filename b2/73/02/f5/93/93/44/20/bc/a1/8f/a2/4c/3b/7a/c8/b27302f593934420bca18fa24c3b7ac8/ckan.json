    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set is a subset of a global croplands data set (Ramankutty and Foley 1999a). The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The data are in ASCII GRID format at 5-min resolution.Navin Ramankutty and Jonathan Foley, of the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) at the University of Wisconsin, developed a global, spatially explicit data set of reconstructed historical croplands from 1700 to 1992. The method for historical reconstruction used a simple algorithm that linked contemporary satellite data and historical cropland inventory data. A spatially explicit croplands data set for 1992 was first derived by calibrating a satellite-derived land cover classification data set against cropland inventory data for 1992. This derived data set was then used within a simple land cover change model, along with historical cropland inventory data, to derive spatially explicit maps of historical croplands. The global data set was restricted to a representation of permanent croplands (i.e., excluding shifting cultivation), which follows the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition of arable lands and permanent crops. Data values represent fraction of grid cell in croplands.Data for the LBA study area are available for the years 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 1992. Although the global croplands data set contains data representing croplands since 1700, essentially no croplands were in the LBA study area until 1900. Data from previous years were excluded at the suggestion of the data originator.More information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/land_use_land_cover_change/historical_croplands/comp/uwcrop_readme.pdf.LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.",
