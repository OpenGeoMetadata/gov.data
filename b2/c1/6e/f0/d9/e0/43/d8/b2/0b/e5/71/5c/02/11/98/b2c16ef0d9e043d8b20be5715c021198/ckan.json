    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optical Physics Company (OPC) proposes to develop a high accuracy version of its interferometric star tracker capable of meeting the milli-arcsecond-level pointing requirements.  Such high accuracy tracker can be used for precision pointing of the large telescope, and can permit open-loop pointing of  narrow-beam laser signals. The latter can enable deep-space lasercom missions without the technical and operational complexity of a ground based beacon.  OPC has already built multiple versions of this star tracker for several applications for various DoD customers.  Current technical maturity of the star tracker is TRL 5- which is expected to advance to TRL 6 during the proposed Phase I project due to space readiness and flight tests under parallel efforts.    During the proposed Phase I effort, OPC will first develop requirements.  This will be followed by design trades and formulation of a detailed design.  Phase I will conclude with a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  During Phase II, the design will be advanced to the Critical Design Review (CDR) level and a prototype will be built and tested.  Given that the existing baseline designs for OPC's visible and SWIR band interferometric star trackers are at TRL 5, OPC has a head start.",
