While these maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unit's authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes.\\\" As such this data is intended for use as a tool for GIS analysis.

Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the unit's legislated boundary, the tracts file created by LRD should be used in conjunction with this boundary file created by LRD.
