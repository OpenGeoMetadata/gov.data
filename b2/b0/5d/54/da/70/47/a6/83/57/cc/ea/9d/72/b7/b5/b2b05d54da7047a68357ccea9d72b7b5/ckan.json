    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Inner product computation is an important primitive used in many techniques for feature dependency detection, distance computation, clustering and correlation computation among others. Recently, peer-to-peer networks are getting increasing attention in various applications involving distributed file sharing, sensor networks, and mobile ad hoc networks. Efficient identification of top few inner product entries from the entire inner product matrix of features in a distributed peer-to-peer network is a challenging problem since centralizing the data from all the nodes in a synchronous, communication efficient manner may not be an option. This paper deals with the problem of identifying significant inner products among features in a peer-to-peer environment where different nodes observe a different set of data. It uses an ordinal framework to develop probabilistic algorithms to find top-LaTeX elements in the inner product matrix. These l  inner product entries are important in making crucial decisions about dependency or relatedness between feature pairs, important for a number of data mining applications. In this paper we present experimental results demonstrating accurate and scalable performance of this algorithm for large peer-to-peer networks and also describe a real-world application for this algorithm.",
