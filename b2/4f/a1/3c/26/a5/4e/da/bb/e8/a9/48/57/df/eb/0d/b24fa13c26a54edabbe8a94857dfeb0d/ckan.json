  "notes": "The Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge Fishery Management Plan (Fishery Plan) provides comprehensive management direction to insure that fish species and habitats are conserved, while maintaining sustainable harvests. The Fishery Plan defines the purposes for which the refuge is managed and a resultant planning direction achieved through development of management objectives and specific tasks. Tasks are assigned priorities and Federal tasks are assigned annual costs for their continuation. The planning effort is designed to span a 5-year period at which time it will be updated.It should be noted that this particular document does not include habitat or public use management activities, which will be addressed in separate planning efforts.A description of the environment is presented and fishery resources, human use, management history and major issues and concerns described. Objectives and tasks are developed from the issues and concerns. Major concerns identified during the planning process included a lack of baseline fishery data, potential over harvest of salmon stocks, impact from development and use of lands adjacent tothe refuge, and public use conflicts. Most of these concerns are largely beyond the direct control of refuge management as they take place outside the refuge boundaries.Objectives developed to address major concerns range from program administration to data collection activities. In general, objectives are aimed at administering the fishery management program at its current level, based on the best available information while obtaining additional data to improve the information base.Work priorities for both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Department) over the next five years will emphasize the tasks to administer the current fishery program. Beyond this, Service work will emphasize monitoring of refuge salmon stocks, evaluating the impacts of off-refuge mining activities, and collecting baseline fishery data on the numerous rivers, sloughs and lakes throughout the refuge.",
