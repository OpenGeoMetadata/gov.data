  "notes": " The Test Support Facility (TSF) is located on the South Base area of Edwards Air Force Base and was originally constructed to support flight testing of the B-2 weapons system. The complex consists of 119 acres surrounded by a security fence and is protected by sophisticated electronic intrusion detection and access control systems. Within the facility are 5 major buildings and 12 support buildings. The site has a total of 470,545 square feet of usable floor space. The Test Support Facility is totally integrated into the Edwards Flight Test Range and has the capability to acquire data from the local sensors or from the neighboring support ranges Pacific Missile Test Center, Western Test Range, Naval Weapons Center, Utah Test and Training Range, Tonopah Test Range, Eglin Air Force Base) through a variety of data and communications links. Ground testing can be supported through a dedicated fiber-optic backbone which permits direct tie in of the aircraft&amp;#39;s instrumentation and communications systems to the mission control facility. This capability exists at all nine aircraft parking locations. Support of all known instrumentation systems is possible through simple software modifications. All aspects of a major flight test effort can be supported from this facility including: performance and flying qualities, loads, structures, avionics, avionics simulation, weapons, human factors, logistics, R&amp;amp;M, EMI/EMC, LO ground testing and user training.
