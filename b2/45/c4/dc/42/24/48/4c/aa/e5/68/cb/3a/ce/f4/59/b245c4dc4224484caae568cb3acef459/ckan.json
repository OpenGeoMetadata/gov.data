  "notes": " This laboratory contains a virtual-reality-simulation space, which is a computer-generated projection that gives a user the illusion of being fully immersed in a three-dimensional world. The user wears special eyewear that synchronizes and filters the projected images to create a realistic impression of 3D space. At present, this 28- by 35- by 14-foot laboratory is being utilized to understand human behavior, physical response, and decision-making skills under simulated conditions of elevated work; findings are validated and compared with measurements taken under non-simulated work conditions. In addition, investigations of fall risk factors, injury processes, and fall prevention technologies are ongoing. The Virtual Reality Laboratory is equipped with four projection systems, an image generator, head tracking system, stereo eyewear and a 3-wall-1-floor screen. The projection systems and image generator function as an integrated system, controlling the projected images as well as the software application. The motion tracking system continuously adjusts the stereo projection to the current position of the user, tracking the subject&amp;#39;s position and updating the stereo projection in real time to that position. The stereo eyewear is integral to the 3D experience, creating the illusion of depth so that the user can walk through the surrounding virtual environment, experiencing the sights and sensation of elevation. Various research projects are underway or have been conducted in this innovative and advanced laboratory, including basic research to determine and validate the overall usefulness of SSVR technology in assessing occupational safety issues, research on scaffolding safety, research on maintaining stability while on sloped roof surfaces, and similar research related to falls from elevation and safety while working at heights.
