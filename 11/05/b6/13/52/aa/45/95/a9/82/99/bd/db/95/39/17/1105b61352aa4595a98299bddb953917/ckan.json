  "notes": " FUNCTION: Constructs and evaluates fiber-optic sensors for a variety of measurands. These measurands include acoustic, pressure, magnetic, and electric field as well as strain and rate of rotation. DESCRIPTION: The sensor construction facility includes two Accuwinder coil winding machines, seven optical fiber fusion splicers, annealing facilities for magnetic materials, and facilities for degassing adhesives for potting purposes. The evaluation facilities include two computer-controlled data reduction and analysis stations, one optimized for acoustic sensors and the other optimized for magnetic sensors. There are two environmental chambers that operate from -50&amp;#176; to 100 &amp;#176;C for life testing of prototype sensors. The acoustic sensor evaluation facility also includes a pressure chamber for determining dc acoustic sensitivity as well as crush performance of prototype fiber-optic hydrophone designs (left figure above). Also available is a G-40 shipboard calibrator, which can operate over a 5 to 1000 Hz frequency range at ambient pressure and between 4&amp;#176; and 35 &amp;#176;C (right figure above). The evaluation facility for rate of rotation sensors includes a Contraves rate table (1000 deg/s to Earth rate) and a suite of measurement equipment. The evaluation facility for magnetic sensors includes MuMetal magnetic shields for low noise measurements and an automated system for dynamic magnetization and Barkhausen noise measurements. The facility has optical test equipment to evaluate optical sources as well as an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) and a Status Monitoring and Reliability Test System (SMARTS) to evaluate fiber-optic circuitry. A number of optical sources at 1.3 and 1.5 &amp;#956;m wavelengths (including a tunable source) are also available. INSTRUMENTATION: The facility uses seven Hewlett Packard 3562A and three Hewlett Packard 3582A dual-channel spectrum analyzers, one Hewlett Packard 3567 modular three-channel spectrum analyzer, three Tektronix single-channel spectrum analyzers, two HP 89410 network analyzers, three TEAC RD-200T 16-channel digital audiotape recorders, and one RX-800 32-channel DAT recorder. Other instruments include an Anritsu MS 9710B optical spectrum analyzer and an HP 8509B lightwave polarization analyzer.  ",
