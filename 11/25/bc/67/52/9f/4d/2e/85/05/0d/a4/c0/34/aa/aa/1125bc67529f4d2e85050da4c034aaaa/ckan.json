  "notes": " FUNCTION: The Gamma-Ray Imaging Laboratory is used for designing and testing high-resolution solid-state detectors used in imaging and spectral measurements of X rays and gamma rays. The laboratory facilities include cryostats and electronics to test highly segmented detectors made from silicon or germanium. The segmentation into strips or pixels provides position sensitivity used in reconstruction of the gamma-ray image. The data acquisition system can support test configurations with up to 400 channels of low-noise electronics. DESCRIPTION: The Gamma-Ray Imaging Laboratory provides the resources necessary to test new detector concepts for high-sensitivity measurements of X rays and gamma rays. Much of the work in the laboratory has focused on developing large arrays of intrinsic silicon, lithium-drifted silicon, or germanium detectors that have been segmented into strips or pixels to provide interaction position information necessary for imaging. These detectors provide significantly improved capabilities for detection of natural gamma radiation on Earth as well as in space: for the measurements of X- and gamma-ray emission in solar flares, and astronomical sources of gamma rays such as novae and supernovae and active galactic nuclei; for homeland defense and DoD application in the detection of shielded nuclear materials; and for nuclear medical imaging, both SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography). INSTRUMENTATION: Several cryostats and associated cryogenic systems provide a controlled temperature environment for detector performance testing from 75 K to room temperature. The cryostats provide cold finger mounting of the detector under test and a volume for mounting low-noise electronics at an intermediate temperature. Up to 100 signals can pass through the cryostat wall to a Versamodule Eurocard (VME)-based signal processing and digitization system. Aperture windows in the cryostats permit probing of the detectors using collimated gamma-ray beams from radioactive sources that are mounted on a computer-controlled external positioning system. Two separate large environmental chambers are available to test gamma-ray detectors down to -70 &amp;#176;C.  ",
