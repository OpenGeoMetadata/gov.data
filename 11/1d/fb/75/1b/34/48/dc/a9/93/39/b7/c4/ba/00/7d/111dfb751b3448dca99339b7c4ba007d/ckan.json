    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Innovative Imaging and Research, a small technology development company,\nhas teamed with the University of Southern Mississippi Instrument and\nCryogenics Research Laboratory to integrate existing NASA Stennis Space\nCenter heritage cryogen level monitoring technology with noncontact\noptical methods and advanced signal processing to create a 21st century\nliquid cryogen level measurement technique.  We propose to place a\nfiber-optic laser range finder on the upper surface of a low pressure\ncryogen run tank and use the existing Hall effect float system as an\noptical target to reflect the light signal back to the range finder.  We\nalso propose combining measurements obtained with the fiber-optic range\nfinder with those taken by the heritage system using a custom Kalman\nfilter signal processing algorithm to reduce measurement noise and\nincrease overall accuracy.  Our optical technique has several advantages\nover the existing Hall effect method.  It yields near continuous\nmeasurements and is not dependent on the location of individual sensors.\nIt is based on an alternate physics approach and therefore yields\ncompletely independent results.  The optical range finder instrument\ncalibration is performed outside the tank, so test operation is not\nsignificantly impacted and run tanks do not need to be emptied.  In\naddition, an optical fiber mounted on the upper surface of a cryogen\ntank does not present foreign object debris (FOD) concerns.  During our\nPhase 1 STTR project we will demonstrate our concept in a university\ncryogen research laboratory using a commercial optical range finder.  In\nPhase 2 we plan to demonstrate our concept with fiber-optic technology\nusing the SSC Instrument Test Apparatus under a NASA Space Act\nAgreement.  Our Phase 1 concept is at a technology readiness level (TRL)\nof 2.  We expect to complete Phase 1 at a TRL of 4 and complete Phase 2\nat a TRL of 6.",
