    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Accurate safety analysis of software suffers from a lack of appropriate tools for software developers. Current automated tools require approximate analyses; fully-assured verification with formal methods is expert-intensive. A key to improvement is machine-checkable specifications for software modules. Specifications are also needed to express the intent of software. Further, to scale to wide use, engineers who are not formal methods experts must have usable tools, as automated as possible, integrated into their usual software development environments (IDEs).\r\n\r\nOur proposal, SPEEDY, is a user experience (UX) design for convenient generation, manipulation, and checking of specifications, directly in a common IDE (Eclipse). The tool's design integrates automated specification suggestion using current tools and published techniques. The tool also enables checking and debugging specifications directly in the IDE, with information presented in the context of the source code. The proposal targets C/C++ programs, particularly for embedded software development.\r\n\r\nPhase I of SPEEDY assessed current specification languages and prototyped the key UX mechanisms: we are now confident that they can be implemented in the Eclipse IDE. We also integrated several analysis tools, demonstrating that SPEEDY can obtain specification suggestions from external sources. We assessed many specification suggestion algorithms, selecting some to be implemented and evaluated on realistic software in Phase II. Phase I also prototyped the integrating specification checking tools and specification debugging features. We demonstrated SPEEDY on NASA software from the NASA open software site.\r\n\r\nThe Phase II proposal presents a plan for scaling up the successful Phase I prototype in many dimensions: more language features; more sophisticated user guidance in generating and debugging specifications; more specification suggestion algorithms; scaled up to realistic program size.",
