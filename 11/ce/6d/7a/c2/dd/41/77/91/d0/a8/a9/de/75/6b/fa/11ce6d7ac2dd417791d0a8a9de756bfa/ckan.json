    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This investigation was completed in 2010, and a final report was submitted to NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the joint kinematics and kinetics that occur during squat and deadlift exercise on the ARED to inform a future proposal that will include a biomechanical analysis of exercise on the ISS. Six subjects (3m/3f) were tested while performing single legged squats, normal squats, increased range of motion squats, wide stance squats, fast squats, reduced range of motion squats, normal deadlift, and sumo deadlift. Ground reaction force (GRF) and motion capture data were collected as each subject performed a single repetition using a load that approximated their 10 repetition maximum. Testing loads were determined during an earlier training session. Three dimensional joint kinematics and kinetics were computed using a standard inverse dynamics approach. GRF data indicated that peak loads were dependent upon exercise type and that the peak GRF did not always occur at the same time during a repetition depending upon the exercise. Bilateral joint kinematics were generally symmetrical; however, hip adduction and rotation displayed increased bilateral asymmetry. Joint kinetics differed between exercise types although there were no specific trends across all variables. In general during the downward motion, work was performed on the hip and knee extensors for all exercises, and work was performed by the hip and knee extensors during the upward motion. Positive and negative work for hip adduction/abduction, hip internal/external rotation, and ankle flexion varied across exercises. Bilateral joint kinetics were asymmetrical, which may reflect a property of ARED that needs further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, we suggest that the exercises included in a future flight study include, along with the justification:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Normal Squat: A baseline measure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Single Legged Squat: Increased net hip torque and only exercise inducing hip adduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Wide Normal Squat: Hip adduction and rotation kinematics suggest femoral head loading differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Normal Deadlift: Baseline measure, but with different kinematics than the squat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Increasing the subject size of the current study to allow for standard statistical analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Retest of current subjects bilateral symmetry using a free weight condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Further study of the FS condition relative to free weights to better understand joint kinetic differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IR squats had larger kinetic values than others, variation was also increased because of between subject differences. We did not recommend this lift because of the larger subject variation, but this lift should also be considered in a future study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
