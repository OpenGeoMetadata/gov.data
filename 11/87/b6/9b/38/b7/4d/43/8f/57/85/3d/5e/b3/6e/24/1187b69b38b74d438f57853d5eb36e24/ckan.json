    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Electric propulsion (EP) thrusters have the potential to enhance or\nenable Discovery-class missions.  However, a significant challenge in\nscaling micro (&amp;lt;  100 W) EP devices up as well as scaling macro (&amp;gt;\n1 kW) EP devices down is the lack of a compatible neutralizer technology\nin the meso scale ( &amp;lt; 1 kW).  Traditionally, the technology used for\nspacecraft neutralization has been the hollow cathode, though hollow\ncathodes require an unsatisfactory fraction of a propulsion system's\npropellant and power in the meso-scale regime.  In fact, they require\nsuch a large amount of propellant and power that system efficiency is\nreduced by 50-100&amp;#37;.  In addition, using a hollow cathode causes\nundesirable specific impulse reduction. The most promising technology\nfor meso-scale neutralizers is field emission (FE), which requires the\nuse of nano-scale sharp emitters and high electric fields to establish a\nbeam of electrons.  The drawback of FE devices is that the nano-scale\nemitters become damaged when operated in elevated pressure environments\n(10-5 Torr), causing catastrophic failure.  The research proposed here\nis to develop field-emission cathodes for use in meso-scale EP that\neliminate tip degradation not through attempts to minimize tip wear, but\ninstead by incorporating self-assembling nanostructures that can\nrepeatedly re-generate damaged emitter tips in space and fully restore\nthe functionality of a damaged or degraded cathode. The procedure is the\nequivalent of having a MEMS fabrication and repair lab on-board the\nspacecraft. The re-generable emitters proposed here have been\nsuccessfully demonstrated in the laboratory in work by Makela, et. al.\ndating back to 2007.  The re-generable neutralizers could enable highly\nefficient, high-Isp, low-mass propulsion systems operating between a few\nWatts and 1 kW by either scaling existing micro technologies up or\nscaling existing macro technologies down.",
