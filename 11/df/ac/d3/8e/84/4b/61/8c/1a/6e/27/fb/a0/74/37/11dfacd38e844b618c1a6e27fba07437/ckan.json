As such, the map extent indicated in the Spatial_Domain element is representative of the larger data set and not an individual tile. The data sets are organized in 10,000 ft x 10,000 ft tiles using the NC Bureau of Land Records Management (LRMP) standards. Specific information about individual data tiles is included in the data delivery index. More information about this can be obtained at www.ncfloodmaps.com. The native EBN full return flight lines were converted to LAS format (version 1.1) by the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program in May 2009. All other citation information remains unchanged.",

However, as with all other geospatial data sets, users must take into consideration the consequences of using the data for specific applications, business processes, decisions, and map display. For example, surface conditions may have changed in some areas since the initial data was captured.

The data should not be used without full review and comprehension of the metadata. acknowledgement of the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program is appreciated when using the data set.
