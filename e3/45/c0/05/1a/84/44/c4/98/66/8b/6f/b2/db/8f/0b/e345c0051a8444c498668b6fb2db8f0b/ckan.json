Knowledge of the spatial distribution of natural and cultural resources is critical to maintaining sound resource management policies. By virtue of the fact that geomorphic units and geological deposits set boundary conditions on, among other variables, the age and depositional environment under which prehistoric resources may have accumulated, they constitute a basic unit of analysis in cultural and paleobiological resource management. Landform sediment assemblage (LSA) units (previously defined and mapped by Bettis et al. 1995) in the upper Mississippi River valley under the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers - Rock Island District, were digitized using ARC/INFO, a Geographic Information System (GIS) at a scale of 1:24,000. Additionally, a large scale (1:190,000) color poster showing the major LSA units was produced to visually summarize these geomorphic data for the entire project area.",

The development of the coverages in the NRGIS Library represents a major investment of staff time and effort.
