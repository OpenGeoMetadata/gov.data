This dataset is intended to be used with the following two tabular dBase files: http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu92e and http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu01. The two tabular datasets contain the Tillage Practices in the Conterminous United States, 1989-2004---Datasets Aggregated by Watershed. This dataset and the two tabular datasets can be linked using the common attribute HUC8_N. Information about how the tabular data and geospatial data can be related are given in the data series report: http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/ds573/ .The original dataset is the 12-digit Subwatershed boundaries (WBD_archive_17nov2009_9.2_file). The 12-digit boundaries were dissolved to 8-digit boundaries to be used with the two tabular .dbase data files containing the tillage practice data for the United States. ORIGINAL METADATA: This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the entire United States. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the \"Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3\" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/index.html . Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow modification.",
