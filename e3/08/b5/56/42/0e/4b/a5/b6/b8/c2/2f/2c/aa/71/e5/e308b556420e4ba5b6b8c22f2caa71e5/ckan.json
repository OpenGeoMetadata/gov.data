  "notes": "Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The product is a mosaic of 10 meter posting (10- by 10-m data spacing) DEMs covering the National Forest. Input data for the production of the mosaic consisted of the10 meter posting DEMs, in standard USGS format, required to provide coverage of the National Forest. The mosaic is available in ERDAS Imagine .img format (version 8.5) and ESRI GRID format. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by the USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The standard USGS format DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. Each standard USGS DEM provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without over edge.",
