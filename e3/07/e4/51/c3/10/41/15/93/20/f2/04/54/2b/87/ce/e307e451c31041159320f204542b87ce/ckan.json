  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Visual Landing Aids (VLA) Laboratory serves to support fleet VLA systems by maintaining the latest service change configuration of currently deployed VLA systems. The lab also is used to develop, fabricate and troubleshoot system problems.  Function:  The VLA Lab at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ houses and maintains shipboard representative VLA systems that are currently operating in the fleet and at land-based fields. Current VLA systems include: Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS), Manually Operated Visual Landing System (MOVLAS), Long Range Line-Up System (LRLS), marking and lighting fixtures, Landing Signal Officer Display System (LSODS), Integrated Launch and Recovery Television Surveillance (ILARTS) system, Horizon Reference Set (HRS), Vertical Short Take-Off and Landing (VSTOL) system, Helicopter Operations and Surveillance System (HOSS) and various other electronic systems.  Capabilities:  The VLA Lab consists of a large systems area, three small workshops, a storage room and an office and reference area located on the second deck. The VLA systems housed and maintained by the VLA Lab serve to support engineering investigations and provide fleet technical assistance. The lab is also capable of performing functional and qualification tests, shipboard hardware integration, system interoperability testing and rapid response to in-service fleet issues.  ",
