    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The sample scenarios provided here are competition scenarios from Diagnostic Problems I and II of DXC'10. The zip file has a spreadsheet (and pdf) that lists the scenarios and relevant fault information. Each scenario is provided in three formats: tab-delimited .txt file, Matlab .mat file, and tab-delimited .scn file. The different formats are provided for your convenience; they have the same data. The scenario (.scn) files are the format read by the DXC framework. See the system catalogs and schematics for additional information.\r\n\r\nFor those involved in last year's competition, note that DXC'10 Diagnostic Problem I competition data posted last year (dated 20101105) had some problems which were fixed in the DPI sample data set posted here. The battery \"AbruptParasiticLoad\" scenario (Exp. 1311) was removed as it was found to have different behavior prior to fault injection than nominal scenarios. Exp 1229_015f was too short (224 seconds) and was removed. Several runs caused an issue when a value was expected to be a real but was interpreted as an integer in the framework (1251, 1285, 1316, 1323, and 1330); this has been fixed.\r\n\r\nThere are no \"AbruptParasiticLoad\" faults in the DXC11 DPI competition data.
