    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Paragon proposes to develop a single-loop, non-toxic, stagnating active pumped loop thermal control design for NASA's Orion or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) program. While this technology was developed in the Apollo era, it has not been used in space since then.  Furthermore, the fluids used in those first-generation units are not compatible with today's human-rated flight requirements as they could be considered toxic and/or flammable.  Though work at JSC by Tuan et al. has targeted modeling and verifying the model of a stagnating radiator with one candidate fluid, Paragon proposes to parallel this effort with an alternative fluid as a back-up to that currently base-lined in the Orion program.  \r\nThis technology will be a significant innovation in that stagnating radiator designs provide self regulation of thermal dissipation parameters.  As heat flow to the radiator is reduced, less cooling capacity is required; stagnating radiators incorporate fluids that gradually change properties. If increased heating loads are encountered, the radiator working fluid changes again to increase the heat transfer capability of the radiator. \r\nThis technology is directly relevant to NASA's Orion and LSAM development.  Our plan for Phase I and II is in-line with bringing this technology from a TRL 2 to a TRL 4-6 depending on Phase II assumptions.\r\n",
