  "notes": "This image represents a 8 meter resolution bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank south of Vieques, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired extra multibeam bathymetry data on the south shelf of Vieques durring the Northeast Reserve Puerto Rico mission from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsburg Em 1002 echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2013 acquisition software. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
