    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Phase I STTR project will develop a highly reflecting, broadband, radiation resistant, low-stress and lightweight, membrane integrated into an electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device for wavefront control applications in space telescopes. The underlying technology builds on nanomaterial coatings and electro-optical modeling competency of the company. InnoSense LLC (ISL) will collaborate with Dr. Harold Kahn, Research Associate Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, to integrate the low-cost, flexible nanocomposite membrane mirror into a MEMS device. The Phase I project would demonstrate: (a) a membrane mirror capable of high broadband reflectivity; (b) deflections &gt; 20-30 micron; and (c) large temporal bandwidth at frequency &gt; 1 KHz. The focus of Phase II will be optimization of the reflecting membrane, refinements to the design of the deformable membrane mirror (DMM) device, accompanied by extensive evaluation of prototype DMMs for their ability to correct for large wavefront aberrations at high frequencies to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, and enable high fidelity imaging capability. To ensure success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 70 person-years of experience in nanomaterials coatings, MEMS, mechanical and electro-optical modeling. ",
