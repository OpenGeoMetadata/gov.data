      "description": "The Aqueduct Water Risk Framework enables users to\r\nstudy indicators individually or collectively, as well as\r\nto quantify and compare a variety of multidimensional\r\nwater-related measures. Indicators are grouped into three\r\ncategories of water risks to business based on definitions\r\nprovided by Ceres\r\n\r\nPhysical Risks: Quantity: Physical risks related to\r\nquantity are defined as the exposure to changes in water\r\nquantity (e.g. droughts or floods) that may impact a\r\ncompany’s direct operations, supply chains and/or logistics.\r\nPhysical water risks also refer to the disruption\r\nof needed electric power due to water issues because\r\nmany electricity sources require water for cooling (e.g.\r\nnuclear or coal plants) or for generation (hydropower).\r\n\r\nPhysical Risks: Quality: Physical risks related to\r\nquality are defined as the exposure to changes in water\r\nquality that may impact a company’s direct operations,\r\nsupply chains, and/or logistics.\r\n\r\nReputational and Regulatory Risks: Reputational\r\nrisks are defined as potential conflicts with the public\r\nregarding water issues that can damage a company’s\r\nimage or result in the loss of the company’s license\r\nto operate in a community. Reputational risks are\r\nparticularly common in developing countries where\r\ninfrastructure and/or regulation may not be sufficient\r\nto provide all users with access to safe and reliable\r\ndrinking water supplies. Regulatory risks are defined as\r\nthe exposure to the impacts of water-related regulations\r\non a given company. As physical and reputational pressures\r\nincrease, many local and national governments\r\nare responding with more stringent water policies.\r\nIf unanticipated, these regulatory changes can prove\r\ncostly to companies and, in some cases, limit industrial\r\nactivities in particular geographic areas.",
