    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposed Small Business Innovative Research Phase I addresses the  development of a catalytic system for efficient conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to hydrocarbon and organic species via carbon monoxide. This approach is particularly relevant to future Mars missions, since the Martian atmosphere is comprised of over 95&#37; CO2. The proposed approach will utilize Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) chemistry to selectively convert CO produced by CO2 reduction, e.g., from  reverse water gas shift (RWGS), into hydrocarbons and oxygenates for many applications. The proposed approach is complementary to previous effort by Eltron in which nanoscale catalysts were developed for promoting RWGS. The proposed approach meshes ideally with RWGS in that stoichiometric mixtures of carbon dioxide and hydrogen lead to an H2:CO ratio of approximately 1.5 at the RWGS exit. Phase I will consist of the preparation, characterization, and evaluation of 12-15 candidate catalysts anticipated to have exceptional activity for selective (essentially CO2 free) FTS. Downselection of catalysts and identification of preferred conditions will result during Phase I. Phase II will involve the fabrication and testing of a closed loop system for converting CO2 and hydrogen into fuels, chemicals, plastics, etc.\r\n",
