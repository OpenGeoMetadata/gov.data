  "notes": "Populations of many species of secretive marsh birds are thought to be declining in North America and several species are game birds in many states and provinces. And yet, we currently lack effective monitoring programs to adequately estimate population trends of secretive marsh birds. The most commonly-used method to survey secretive marsh birds is the broadcast of recorded calls. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks associated with call-broadcast surveys is essential prior to implementing a continent-wide monitoring program. The main goal of this project was to develop a standardized monitoring protocol for secretive marsh birds that would be applicable for use throughout North America, and to have the recommended protocols fieldtested by staff of numerous National Wildlife Refuges around the country. Other goals were to use the data collected by these refuges to 1) compare vocalization probability between passive and call-broadcast surveys, 2) compare temporal variation in vocalization probability between paired passive and call-broadcast surveys, 3) determine the effect of broadcasting calls of multiple marsh birds on vocalization probability of each target species, and 4) compare observer bias between passive and call-broadcast surveys. We present a protocol that includes the use of call-broadcast for surveying marsh birds throughout North America. We include the rationale behind the various components included in the protocol. This protocol is/has already being used by 194 participants representing 45 U.S. states/territories, 3 Canadian provinces, and 3 Mexican states. The data generated has been pooled into a large relational database allowing analyses to address our initial objectives. Number of birds detected was higher for call-broadcast surveys compared to passive surveys for all 8 species examined. Coefficient of variation in number of birds detected was lower for call-broadcast surveys compared to passive surveys for most species examined. We found no evidence that broadcasting calls of other species negates the benefit of conspecific call-broadcast. Moreover, our results suggest that increasing the number of minutes of conspecific call-broadcast did not further increase the number of birds detected; 30 seconds of call-broadcast was sufficient to enhance vocalization probability of all 8 species. Observer detection probability was higher on the call-broadcast segment of the surveys compared to the passive segment of the surveys for clapper rails, but didnâ€™t differ between passive and call-broadcast for the other 6 species.",
