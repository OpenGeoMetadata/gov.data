  "notes": " The PVD Research Facility can deposit refractory metal coatings on flat samples as well as cylindrical samples up to 12 in. long. The facility is currently being used to develop thick, refractory metal coatings for large caliber gun barrel sections. These coatings are subsequently characterized using a rigorous coatings characterization protocol. A novel &amp;quot;lock-lock&amp;quot; design has been integrated into this facility in order to perform thin film depositions with rapid turnaround. The &amp;quot;load-lock&amp;quot; design, coupled with our excellent characterization capabilities, enables the rapid optimization of coating properties including adhesion. This facility can also be utilized to perform PVD research for the aerospace, automotive, pressure vessel and piping, and chemical processing industries.   The PVD Process Development Facility has been designed to perform both thick depositions on large caliber gun barrel sections (and other cylinders) up to 48 in. long and thin film depositions on cylindrical samples using a novel &amp;quot;load-lock&amp;quot; design. Barrel sections processed in this facility are characterized using a rigorous protocol. Lessoned learned are incorporated into subsequent depositions. This facility addresses the issues of scaling up PVD-based technology including assembly/disassembly procedures, cathode design optimization, plasma cleaning procedures, process control, etc. This facility can also be utilized to perform PVD research and development for the aerospace, automotive, pressure vessel and piping, and chemical processing industries. The PVD Pre-Production Facility is a world-class facility currently being commissioned at the Watervliet Arsenal in order to apply sputtered coatings to the bores of full-length, large caliber gun barrels. The process is completely environmentally friendly, unlike the current chrome plating process, and can apply high performance refractory metals in order to achieve service life extension. Cylinders up to 30 feet in length can be coated in this facility using a number of different coating materials.  ",
