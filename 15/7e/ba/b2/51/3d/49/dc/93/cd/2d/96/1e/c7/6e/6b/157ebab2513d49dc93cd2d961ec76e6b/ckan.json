    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) detectors are a new class of detectors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In our FY12 IRAD &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Strained Layer Superlattice Infrared Detector Array Characterization&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;we verified that these devices exhibit a dramatic increase in quantum efficiency (QE) over quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) and are approaching QE values comparable with mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide detectors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The anticipated advantages of SLS detector technology over existing IR detectors are: high sensitivity, band-gap tunable wavelength response (similar to QWIPs), warmer operating temperatures, array spectral uniformity (yet to be realized), high temporal stability, relatively low cost of manufacturing, scalability (to very large format arrays) and multiple vendor sources all contributing to higher performing scientific instruments.&amp;nbsp; Warmer and more stable focal planes lead to simpler instrument designs which result in higher reliability, longer mission lifetimes and reduced costs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In our FY12 IRAD we obtained a test SLS array and performed extensive tests to ascertain the veracity of researcher claims, as well as to assess the potential applications to NASA missions from a practical infusion standpoint.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The most important result of that investigation was the verification of the (unexpected) very high QE.&amp;nbsp; However, along with the dramatic improvement in QE we measured much higher dark current and the array was quite non-uniform. Before we embark on an ambitious in-house program to design and fabricate SLS detectors it would be very valuable to build an IR camera system using the existing SLS array we currently have and perform some local field tests.&amp;nbsp; We believe that actual IR imaging of external environment scenery will prove most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;",
