  "notes": "From April 1978 to April 1982, 85 adult (~2. 7 years-old) elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) were captured and radio-collared on the National Elk Refuge in northwestern Wyoming. Relocations with biotelemetry from 1978 to 1984 showed that the radio-collared elk occupied four distinct summer ranges: 48% summered in Grand Teton National Park, 28% in Yellowstone National Park, 12% in the Teton Wilderness, and 12% in the Gros Ventre drainage. Elk that summered in a specific range are collectively a herd segment of the Jackson elk herd. The fidelity to the summer ranges was 98%; the fidelity to the winter range at the National Elk Refuge was 97%. At least 69% of the calving by elk from all four summer ranges occurred in the Grand Teton National Park central valley. The fidelity to calving areas inversely correlated with the distance between a calving area and the National Elk Refuge winter range. The fall migration commenced in October or November, and 94% of the radio-collared elk arrived at the National Elk Refuge by 15 December. Most elk that were harvested by hunters in the park and on the National Elk Refuge during the early stages of the fall migration were from the Grand Teton National Park herd segment. From 1978 to 1984, hunters reduced the number of wintering elk on the National Elk Refuge from 8,413 to 5,010. Efforts to reduce the size of the Grand Teton National Park herd segment by hunting have been unsuccessful. However, the size of this herd segment seemingly stabilized since the late 1960s and was about 3,700 elk (2,869-4,486, 95% CI, post-hunting season) during this study. We recommend the establishment of management objectives for each of the four herd segments and an investigation of density-dependent effects on the recruitment, survival, and dispersal of juveniles. Reducing the number of elk in Grand Teton National Park and restoring the number and migrations of elk east of Grand Teton National Park to pre-1950 conditions are goals of the state and federal agencies that manage the elk and their habitat. Alternative management based on this research is offered to accomplish those goals.",
