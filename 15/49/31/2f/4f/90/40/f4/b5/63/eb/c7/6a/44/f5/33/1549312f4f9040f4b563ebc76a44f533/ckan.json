The data set was developed by delineating the boundary lines on base maps or overlays and digitizing the delineated lines. Digital Elevation Model data may have been used in part of the process to establish preliminary boundaries. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital map data and attribute data. The hydrologic unit ID code attached to each delineated polygon is linked to the attribute data which contains information on non-contributing area and trans-basin flow.",
