    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Batteries represent complex systems whose internal state vari- ables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure un- der operational conditions. This work exemplifies how more detailed model information and more sophisticated prediction techniques can improve both the accuracy as well as the re- sidual uncertainty of the prediction in Prognostics and Health Management. The more dramatic performance improvement between various prediction techniques is in their ability to learn complex non-linear degradation behavior from the train- ing data and discard any external noise disturbances.\r\nAn algorithm that manages these sources of uncertainty well can yield higher confidence in predictions, expressed by narrower uncertainty bounds. We observed that the particle filter approach results in RUL distributions which have better precision (narrower pdfs) by several Ïƒs (if approximated as Gaussian) as compared to the other regression methods. How- ever, PF requires a more complex implementation and compu- tational overhead than the other methods. This illustrates the basic tradeoff between modeling and algorithm development versus prediction accuracy and precision. For situations like battery health management where the rate of capacity degrada- tion is rather slow, one can rely on simple regression methods that tend to perform well as more data are accumulated and still predict far enough in advance to avoid any catastrophic failures. Techniques like GPR or even the baseline approach can offer a suitable platform in these situations by managing the uncertainty fairly well with much simpler implementations. Other data sets may allow much smaller prediction horizons and hence require precise techniques like particle filters.\r\nIn this study, we conclude that there are several methods one could employ for battery health management applica- tions. Based on end user requirements and available resources, a choice can be made between simple or more elegant tech- niques. The particle filter based approach emerges as the winner when accuracy and precision are considered more important than other requirements.",
