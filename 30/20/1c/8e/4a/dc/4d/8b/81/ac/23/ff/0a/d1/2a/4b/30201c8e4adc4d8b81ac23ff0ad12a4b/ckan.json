    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set reports soil CO2 flux and results of physical and chemical characterization of soils from pastures, secondary forests, and mature forests near Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. CO2 flux measurements were made in the field on a monthly basis at 16 sites from June of 1999 to January 2001. In addition, a set of diel CO2 flux measurements were made at 1-hour intervals at selected pasture, mature and secondary forest sites in June and July 2000. Litter was collected monthly from 2001-2002 at each of the mature forest sites and at four of the secondary forest sites, and mean litter mass is reported. Soil samples were collected and analyzed from several land cover types at two sites during this same time period. There are six comma-delimited ASCII data files with this data set.",
