  "notes": "The San Diego Tracking Team (SDTT) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of wildlife habitat in San Diego County through citizen-based wildlife monitoring coupled with environmental education programs. For 15 years, the SDTT has conducted wildlife track and sign surveys to evaluate the health of key species, the connectivity of open space areas, and the efficacy of the city and county's Multiple Species/Habitat Conservation Plans. Scientific advisors from public resource agencies and academic institutions oversee the tracking protocol, and SDTT data is used in planning transportation and urban development projects, as well as in studies on land use in fragmented habitats (Markovchick-Nicholls et al. 2008). Surveys are conducted by trained volunteers from all over San Diego County who together commit over 1500 hours per year to monitoring over 60 locations around the county. Transects are designated throughout specified open space preserves, land trusts, and other undeveloped lands in the San Diego area. Transects that were established after January 1, 2007 (TransID 60 +) are one kilometer in length and ten meters in width (5m on each side of trail center), and are divided into four sections of 250 meters in length. Any side trail, streambed, or other site with favorable tracking conditions easily visible or within ten meters of the trail is investigated as part of the transect. Prior to 2007, transects were laid out to be approximately one mile in length, 30 feet in width, with variable length sections.Transect teams, which consist of an experienced Transect Leader and from 1 to 6 trained volunteers, survey transects on a seasonal basis each year. Any track or sign identified from the following animals was recorded during surveys: coyote, mule deer, bobcat, gray or kit fox, raccoon, opossum, wood rat, badger, black-tailed jack rabbit, cougar, black bear, spotted or striped skunk, long-tailed weasel, ringtail and roadrunner.
