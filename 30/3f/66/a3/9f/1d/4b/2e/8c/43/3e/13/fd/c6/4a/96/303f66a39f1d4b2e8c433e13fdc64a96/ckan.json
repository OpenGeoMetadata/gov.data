  "notes": "The Community Ecological Monitoring Program (CEMP) arose in 2005 as an extension of the Kluane monitoring project to begin a regional assessment of the health of the Yukon boreal forest ecosystem. This is the seventh annual report to summarize the data on white spruce cone crops, ground berry production, small mammals, snowshoe hares, and carnivore abundance at Kluane Lake, Mayo, Faro, Watson Lake, and Whitehorse. White spruce cone counts were moderate in all areas in 2013 except at Faro where cone crops were high. Ground berries in the forest were moderate in 2013 with some variability from site to site. Watson Lake and Faro had very low ground berry counts. Red-backed voles remained at low numbers in 2013 at most sites and were moderately common only at Kluane and Whitehorse. Snowshoe hares began their increase phase, particularly at Kluane and Faro, recovering from their cyclic low of 2010-2012. The next hare peak in the Yukon will probably occur in 2016 or 2017. Mushroom production was low at Kluane and Mayo but moderate at all other sites in 2013. Soapberries were abundant in 2013 at Whitehorse and Kluane, but moderate to low at Mayo. Snow track counts in winter for mammalian predators are being done at Kluane, Mayo, Whitehorse, Watson Lake, and Faro. At all CEMP sites lynx remained low or declined slightly during 2012-2013. Marten increased to high numbers at Mayo, moderate numbers at Kluane, and decreased dramatically in Whitehorse and Faro. In a separate study local knowledge interviews were completed at Mayo by Mark Oâ€™Donoghue in early 2013 and are summarized briefly here, an important step in bringing local knowledge of trends together with our CEMP data. As additional data are added in the years to come, the regional patterns of ecosystem changes will become more evident.",
