    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The goal of the proposed work is to create new ways to manage,\nvisualize, and share data produced by multiple software analysis tools,\nand to create a framework for integrating diversely-sourced analysis\ntools into software practices, across the lifecycle, in a way that\nimproves both reliability and productivity. Software analysis tools are\nused by software programmers, analysts, and managers to find potential\ndefects in software source code, to enhance compliance with\norganizational development standards of practice, and to assist\ndevelopers and teams in expressing and managing key information\nregarding design intent. While analysis tools have been shown to offer\nquality and productivity benefits to programmers, the present user\nexperience limits their effectiveness and is a substantial barrier to\ntheir adoption into mainstream software development practices.\nAdditionally, there is a growing number of tools now becoming available,\nand the tools are proving to have complementary capabilities, which\nmeans that groups seeking some comprehensiveness of coverage must\ndevelop multi-tool approaches.  Finally, a suite of tools can produce\nmore than 10,000 individual findings for a mid-sized software system,\ncreating challenges for prioritization and focus. The project addresses\nthe challenge through the development and evaluation of an analytic tool\nsuite, called Sierra client and server, to support data management,\nintegration, filtering, and querying of large numbers of findings drawn\nfrom multiple tools.  It does this in a way that supports teams and\ncollaboration, auditing and tracking, longitudinal analysis, interactive\nvisualization, and management analytics.",
