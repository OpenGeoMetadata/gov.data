  "notes": "Pursuant to guidance provided in the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) policy memorandum entitled \"Policy for Addressing Degraded Ground Water Quality Areas\" dated March 1, 2000, a statewide list of significantly degraded areas with nitrate was developed. In 2002, the DEQ, in cooperation with the Idaho Ground Water Monitoring Technical Committee (GWMTC) published a ranking of 25 Nitrate Priority Areas (NPAs). The NPAs are areas where elevated levels of nitrate have been found in ground water. In 2008, incorporating recent monitoring, 32 NPA's were evaluated and prioritized. DEQ, in conjunction with the GWMTC revised the NPAs published in 2002. The revisions utilized data collected since the original NPAs were developed to evaluate ground water quality changes in existing NPAs and to identify new areas with nitrate degraded ground water. In the summer of 2006 the GWMTC began the process of revising the NPAs. Based on experience gained since 2002, which provided agencies with a better understanding of the resources necessary to address ground water degradation over large areas, it was decided to limit the effort to delineating only Priority I NPAs and not include Priority 2 NPAs. DEQ, in conjunction with the GWMTC revised the NPAs published in 2002. The revisions utilized data collected since the original NPAs were developed to evaluate ground water quality changes in existing NPAs and to identify new areas with nitrate degraded ground water. In the summer of 2006 the GWMTC began the process of revising the NPAs. Based on experience gained since 2002, which provided agencies with a better understanding of the resources necessary to address ground water degradation over large areas, it was decided to limit the effort to delineating only Priority I NPAs and not include Priority 2 NPAs. The minimum criterion for a Priority 1 NPA is 25% of sampled wells have nitrate levels at or above 5 milligrams per liter (mg/L). The state and federal drinking water standard, as well as the Idaho Ground Water Quality Standard for nitrate is 10 mg/L. Within a Priority 2 NPA 50% of the sampled wells have nitrate levels at or above 2 mg/L. Almost all developed areas of the state meet this criterion.",
