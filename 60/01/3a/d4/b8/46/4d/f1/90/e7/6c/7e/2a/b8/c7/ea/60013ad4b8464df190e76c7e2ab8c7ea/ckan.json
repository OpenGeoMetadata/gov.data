      "description": "One of several project memos supplementing the final report.  \n\nDetermination of heat flow is a crucial element in estimating geothermal resource potential. Geothermal gradient is one of the key components in calculating heat flow. The oil and gas industry activity within the Appalachian Basin is a wealth of temperature at depth data, as ‘raw’ or uncorrected Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) values are routinely collected during the oil and gas drilling and/or extraction process. However, BHT can differ from true in-situ rock values due to drilling disturbances, circulation of fluids, and other human induced factors. Additionally, extreme terrain variations as seen in mountainous areas can impact accurate determination of geothermal gradient. For these reasons, BHT values are generally ‘corrected’ to approximate an equilibrium temperature-depth profile. Over the years, several approaches to BHT corrections have been used in heat flow determinations and geothermal resource estimations. This memo describes the BHT correction methodology used in this GPFA-AB project.",

      "description": "One of several project memos supplementing the final report.  \n\nIn order to determine properties of the thermal field at depth, the thermal conductivity stratigraphy of the basin must be known everywhere. In practice, it is infeasible to know the conductivity stratigraphy everywhere, so approximations are needed. For this project, the Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America (COSUNA) stratigraphic columns, available from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists were used as approximations of the stratigraphy because 1) well specific stratigraphy is not available for every well, and 2) the time constraints of Phase 1 would not be conducive to implementing specific geology to each well. COSUNA provides information on stratigraphy for ‘sections’ throughout the continent, including approximate thicknesses of different rock types. A weighted average of thermal conductivity for the entire wellbore can be approximated by consulting COSUNA charts for the various rock types and thicknesses encountered within the well. This memo documents the approach, assumptions, limitations, advantages, etc. of the COSUNA methodology for assignment of thermal conductivity and formation thicknesses to each well.",

Outliers pose a problem for non-robust regression schemes because they would have high squared residuals. Many regression techniques seek to minimize the squared residuals, so an outlier can have undue influence on the results of the analysis. This memo outlines the recommended outlier detection algorithm and contains several appendices within it. Appendix 1 outlines the previous work on outlier algorithms for the NY and PA geothermal dataset. Appendix 2 illustrates the sensitivity of the final results to algorithm parameters over a reasonable range of values. Appendix 3 provides Monte Carlo type I error rates for different distributions with known shape (e.g. normal, student t, uniform). The type I errors were derived empirically using Monte Carlo simulation for sample size of 25. In addition to references, appendices for this memo include:\n1.

For 77 wells, thermal model outcomes of the conductivity stratigraphy based on well details are compared to thermal model outcomes for the same locations if the COSUNA approximation is used instead. This memo first describes the approach of selecting a smaller subset of wells from the large collection to better understand the Basin’s characteristics. Criteria were established for well selection based on availability of better lithology detail, multiple temperature-depth readings at appropriate depths, spatial distribution throughout the region of interest, etc. against which to test the COSUNA-based thermal model. The memo then describes the Monte Carlo simulation parameters. The results of the analysis are that the differences between the COSUNA stratigraphy with Carter conductivities and the detailed stratigraphy are generally minor when compared over the whole region.",

Absent a regionally complete map of deep faults, gravity and magnetic data are analyzed to extract a multi-scale-edge Poisson wavelet representation of the locations of rocks of laterally contrasting physical properties. Among these lateral rock property boundaries are a subset that are candidates for future fault slip, if fluid pressures change and if a plane of weakness is properly oriented in space. To narrow the focus of this analysis onto rock property boundaries of greater concern (e.g., faults with demonstrated propensity to slip), a second step was to identify the co-occurrence of rock-property-boundaries at depths of 3-4 km and seismic activity registered in earthquake catalogs or by EarthScope. One approach to exploring the likelihood that some of the faults in the region might be reactivated if subsurface pressures change is an analysis of tendency to slip, which is based on determination of the spatial orientation of a structure (plane of weakness) relative to the direction of the regional principal compressive stress. This method will produce interesting results that foster further investigation although at this stage the results will be of low reliability as indicators of the risk of induced seismicity. Collection of pertinent data during Phase 2 is vital to create more reliable risk results.",

      "description": "One of several project memos supplementing the final report.  \n\nRisk Analysis in GPFA-AB\nThis memo builds upon the 1 April 2015 memo entitled “Combining Risk Factors.” The relevant discussion from the previous memo is retained, when applicable. One difference here is an emphasis that map colors for 3-color or 5-color maps should be related to the actual acceptability of a location measured on that risk index at the scale of the analysis. They are not relative metrics providing just a comparison to other locations or projects, but absolute evaluations of project acceptability. This makes it reasonable to consider the minimum value across risk indices as a criterion for project acceptability. This memo outlines the required map data format for the individual risk factor maps, and the information that will be required. That includes thresholds used for scaling. The memo also describes some of the ways to represent uncertainty in the analyses and visualization tools that may be used in our final analyses. This memo summarizes some methods that we thought would be applicable to combining risk factors, but it does not represent the final methods used in the analysis. The next memo gives the final results and describes the methods used.",

As a result of the research, 'play fairways' were identified for further study, based on four 'risk' criteria:  1) the Thermal Resource Quality, 2) the Natural Reservoir Quality, 3) the Risk of Seismic Activity, and the 4) Utilization Viability.  \n\nIn addition to the final report document, this submission includes project 'memos' referred to throughout the report.  Many of these same memos are also provided in the submission with the detailed data products accompanying the relevant risk factor (thermal, reservoir, seismicity, and utilization). \n\nA portion of the executive overview follows: \n\nGeothermal energy is an attractive sustainable energy source. Project developers need confirmation of the resource base to warrant their time and financial resources.  The hydrocarbon industry has addressed exploration and development complexities through use of a technique referred to as Play Fairway Analysis (PFA). The PFA technique assigns risk metrics that communicate the favorability of potential hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in order to enable prudent allocation of exploration and development resources.  \nThe purpose of this Department of Energy funded effort is to apply the PFA approach to geothermal exploration and development, thus providing a technique for Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis (GPFA). This project focuses on four risk factors of concern for direct-use geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin (AB) portions of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia (Figure 1). These risk factors are 1) thermal resource quality, 2) natural reservoir quality, 3) induced seismicity, and 4) utilization opportunities (Figure 2).  This research expands upon and updates methodologies used in previous assessments of the potential for geothermal fields and utilization in the Appalachian Basin, and also introduces novel approaches and metrics for quantification of geothermal reservoir productivity in sedimentary basins. Unique to this project are several methodologies for combining the risk factors into a single commensurate objective that communicates the estimated overall favorability of geothermal development. Uncertainty in the risk estimation is also quantified. Based on these metrics, geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin were identified as potentially viable for a variety of direct-use-heat applications. The methodologies developed in this project may be applied in other sedimentary basins as a foundation for low temperature (50-150 °C), direct use geothermal resource, risk, and uncertainty assessment. Through our identification of plays, this project reveals the potential for widespread assessment of low-temperature geothermal energy from sedimentary basins as an alternative to current heating sources that are unsustainable.\nThere is an important distinction in this Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis project as compared to hydrothermal projects: this Appalachian Basin analysis is focused on the direct use of the heat, rather than on electrical production. Lindal (1973) illuminated numerous industrial and other low-temperature applications of geothermal energy for which this analysis can be useful.  The major relationship to electricity is that direct-use applications reduce the electricity requirements for a region.  Even though all of the geothermal resources in the Appalachian Basin are low grade, the high population and high heating demand across New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia translate into economic advantages if geothermal direct-use heating replaces electricity-based heating. The advantage is derived from the high efficiency of extracting heat from geothermal fluids rather than converting the fluids to electricity (Tester et al., 2015).\n",
