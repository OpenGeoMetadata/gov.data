    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The NASA commitment to a human presence in space exploration results in the interaction of humans with challenging environments in space, on lunar, and on planetary bodies.   Meeting these challenges requires the development of technologies that will support human system interaction by integrating monitoring, feedback and situational awareness across all types of mission parameters and observables. A successful human system interaction (HSI) system could extend based on existing agent frameworks and software architectures in which NASA is interested. Our proposed approach enables the design of embedded protocols for human-agent interactions to support crew health, safety, and cognitive load modeling in the context of supporting plan execution as well as overall mission goals and activities. Particularly, our proposed HSI framework consists of various types of agents (including sensing and situational awareness abilities, etc.), a suite of HSI protocols for delegation, adjustable autonomy, situational awareness, HSI and mission-oriented coordination, and the integration of the proposed framework with existing systems to assist mission task operations by providing previously hard to observe, yet vital dynamic information, e.g. human health conditions. Our innovation is an agent-based integrated framework for modeling, simulation and implementation of context and mission aware human-system interaction protocols and interfaces.",
