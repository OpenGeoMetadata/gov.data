    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "# Summary\r\n\r\nThere is a major thrust worldwide on developing affordable Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) technologies in aerospace, automotive and other areas. The fundamental objective is to enhance availability, increase safety and reduce unscheduled maintenance costs. IVHM enables fault detection, isolation, root cause analysis and potential diagnostics. In addition, it aims at developing robust algorithms to predict the onset of a fault, minimizing false alarms and estimating the remaining useful life of the mission despite the adversity. IVHM optimally integrates technologies in sensors, vehicle systems, prognostics and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nNASA and CSIR-NAL have received an award to jointly organize the first Indo-US Workshop on IVHM and Aviation Safety (WIAS), sponsored by Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) from Jan. 5th to 7th, 2012 in Bangalore, which is the aerospace hub of the country. \r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\nThe purpose of the workshop is to deliberate, discuss and evolve the state of the art aerospace systems’ health management strategies, and identify opportunities for collaboration between US & Indian Institutions. This will help orchestrate preparation of IVHM roadmap into the future. This is an attempt, initiated at NAL, in the direction of creating an ecosystem among R&D, Academics and Industry on the subject matter as a part of the IVHM Mission for aerospace industry. We thus see unprecedented opportunities for discussions and knowledge networking in the areas of IVHM.\r\n\r\n# Participation\r\nAn active participation from following organizations / agencies is expected:\r\n\r\nLeading US academic institutions including Stanford, Berkley, Georgia Tech and Auburn University\r\nUS Industry including GM, GE, Honeywell, Boeing Research, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins\r\n\r\nEuropean organizations such as the Center of Excellence, Cranfield, UK; LMS International, Belgium; Airbus & Dassault systems, France\r\nTop Indian Academia like IITs & IISc, R&D (like DRDO, CSIR, DST, DOS), Industry, Regulatory (DGCA) and Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nThe IVHM program envisages close cooperation of R&D, Academia and Industry (national and international) and has immediate applications to legacy, current and future generation aircraft and other programs.\r\n\r\n# Expected outcome     \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>  Collaborations on development of IVHM methodologies, architectures, diagnostics and prognostics algorithms, modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\n<li>  Close cooperation among  US & Indian academic institutions  and research centers Collaborations on crucial topics in IVHM thus complementing each other’s resources\r\n\r\n<li>  Roadmap of IVHM in the Indian and global context involving Indian counterparts from academic, R&D and Industrial institutions\r\n\r\n<li>  Initiating right IVHM concepts in the design of NextGen civil aircraft.\r\n</ul> \r\n\r\n\r\n#  Principal Investigators\r\n\r\n\r\n**India** Dr Satish Chandra, PD, NCAD & HoD, Structures Division, National Aerospace laboratories, Bangalore\r\n\r\n**USA**  Dr Ashok N. Srivastava, Principal Research Scientist & Intelligent Data Understanding Group Lead, NASA Ames Research Center, USA\r\nConvener\r\n\r\n**Convener** Dr Vanam Upendranath, Scientist & IVHM Group Leader, NCAD",
