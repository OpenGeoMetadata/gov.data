    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Aerotonomy, Incorporated and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI),\nwill develop enabling technologies for an aircraft that is capable of\nExtreme Short Takeoff and Landing (ESTOL), while retaining efficient\ntransonic cruise performance, by applying a comprehensive, systems-based\ndesign and analysis approach to innovative combinations of active flow\ncontrol methodologies.  The development of this technology directly\nsupports the four strategic goals of NASA's Next Generation Air\nTransportation System (NGATS), namely 1) increased capacity, 2) improved\nsafety and reliability, 3) increased efficiency and performance, and 4)\nreduced energy consumption and environmental impact. Individual\ncirculation control technologies have been explored over the years, and\nhave been demonstrated to provide highly effective force and moment\naugmentation and improved control capabilities.  However, previous\ninvestigations generally did not focus on combining these CC systems\ninto a cohesive and functional aircraft subsystem, nor did they examine\nCC impacts on other aircraft subsystems or overall integration issues.\nThe primary innovation in the proposed project will be an optimal\nCombined Circulation Control (C3) system that maximizes net CC\nperformance benefits over all flight phases, determined through a\ncomprehensive set of systems-impact trades, including examinations of\nimpacts on power requirements, propulsion system performance, noise\ncharacteristics, cost, reliability and aircraft weight.",
