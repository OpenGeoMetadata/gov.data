    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Long Range Space RF Telecommunications seeks solutions for long range missions using modular deep space transponders with smaller size and lower power components. While reconfigurable signal processing is typically performed in FPGA's, RF hardware is not nearly as agile, but if it were (small high Q filters, broadband actives) power savings and compact flexible RF radio architectures would be possible. As applied to an identified existing S and X band TTC transponder, the innovation described herein applies to EW and broadband RF channelizers, and commercial Software Defined Radios.\r\n\r\nThe proposed innovation seeks to demonstrate that a universal, reusable and digitally programmable RFIC combining avionics proven MEM's and SiGe BiCMOS (130~180 nm) technology is that solution.  The effort will demonstrate the sufficiency of a RF CMOS switch for the application described.  On chip RF primitive circuits are combinatorial configured along with on or off chip ruggedized piezo film MEM's filters/resonators, providing a practical and reliable RF macro block configurable for receive or transmit modes from &lt;100 MHz to &gt;8 GHz.  Primitive RF building blocks are electronically reconnected on chip to enable such RF macro functions as RF up/downconverter, IQ mod/demodulator, and image reject mixer; digital I/O and bias circuitry is included.\r\n",
