    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The application of the Bayesian theory of managing uncertainty and complexity to regression and classification in the form of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), and to state estimation via Particle Filters (PF), proves to be a powerful tool to integrate the diagnosis and prognosis of battery health. Accurate estimates of the state-of-charge (SOC), the state-of-health (SOH) and state-of- life (SOL) for batteries provide a significant value addition to the management of any operation involving electrical systems. This is especially true for aerospace systems, where unanticipated battery performance may lead to catastrophic failures.\r\n\r\nBatteries, composed of multiple electro- chemical cells, are complex systems whose internal state variables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure under operational conditions. In addition, battery performance is strongly influenced by ambient environmental and load conditions. Consequently, inference and estimation techniques need to be applied on indirect measurements, anticipated operational conditions and historical data, for which a Bayesian statistical approach is suitable. Accurate models of electro-chemical processes in the form of equivalent electric circuit parameters need to be combined with statistical models of state transitions, aging processes and measurement fidelity, need to be combined in a formal framework to make the approach viable. The RVM, which is a Bayesian treatment of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used for diagnosis as well as for model development. The PF framework uses this model and statistical estimates of the noise in the system and anticipated operational conditions to provide estimates of SOC, SOH and SOL. Validation of this approach on experimental data from Li-ion batteries is presented.",
