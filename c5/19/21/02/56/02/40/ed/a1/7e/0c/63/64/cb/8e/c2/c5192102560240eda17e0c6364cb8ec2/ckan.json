    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set includes Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F-13 passive microwave brightness temperatures gridded to the geographic (lat/long) and UTM grids of the Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) Large Regional Study Area (LRSA). Data are provided for passive microwave frequencies at 19, 22, 37 and 85 GHz, separated by ascending and descending satellite passes, and include time files. Grid resolution is 25 km, which approximates the sampling resolution of the original swath data. Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation is used to artificially increase (16 times) the density of brightness temperature measurements in the satellite swath reference frame. This process uses actual antenna patterns to create the oversampled array, and the net effect is as if the additional samples had been made by the satellite radiometer itself, i.e., the beam patterns and spatial resolutions of the interpolated data approximate those \nof the original samples. This method is based on the earlier work of Galantowicz and England (1991) and Poe (1990). Please see the documentation \nfor the global version of this data set for complete details. Please see the documentation for the global version of this data set at http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0032.html for complete details. \n\nSeveral things about this data set that are different:\n1) Temporal coverage is limited to 1 February - 31 March 2002 and \n   1 February - 31 March 2003.\n2) The projection/grid is not EASE-Grid, it is CLPX lrsa_geo720.0 and lrsa_utm25000. However, interpolation is Backus-Gilbert, so all the benefits of this interpolation are shared with the global data set.\n3) Filenames are different. 4) CLPX grid dimensions are:\nGEO720.0: 23 cols by 18 rows UTM25000: 17 cols by 17 rows\n5) Grid resolution for CLPX is limited to the CLPX grids that approximate 25 km.",
