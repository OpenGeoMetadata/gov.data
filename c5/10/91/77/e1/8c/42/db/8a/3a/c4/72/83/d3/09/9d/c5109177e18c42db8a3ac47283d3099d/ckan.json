    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Thermal Transfer is a critical part of power electronics application in both terrestrial and space environments.  Due to longer lifetime expectancies and harsh operational conditions, space vehicles require unique materials to deal with the increasing electrical and thermal loads placed upon the structure.  Increasing use of power electronics including high current carrying semiconductor devices such as IGBTs, MOSFETs, power transistors, and modules drive the need for specialty thermal management materials both in the packaging of the discrete devices as well as for the packaging of modules consisting of several or arrays of these devices. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this program (Phase II) is to adapt CarbAlTM-based advanced thermal management substrates from terrestrial to space applications.  ANI will target improved CarbAl&amp;#153;-based heatsinks and thermally conductive circuit boards for power electronic applications.  CarbAl&amp;#153; is a carbon-based thermal composite with a thermal performance exceeding that of many metals.  The low CTE provides excellent matching to state-of-the-art power transistor dies and the low density and robustness make it suitable for space vehicle applications.   The proposed Phase I program is a continuation of the materials development completed internally at ANI.  If successful, the technology developed through this project will provide and accurate, robust, reliable and cost effective.",
