  "notes": "Anthropogenic sources of contamination have the potential to adversely affect the Humboldt River and its terminal wetlands at the Humboldt Wildlife Management Area, Nevada. The latter area provides important habitat for migratory birds. Previous investigations of irrigation drainage in this area found that fish and wildlife had been exposed to elevated concentrations of several elements and total dissolved solids. Discharges to the Humboldt River of additional loads of such contaminants from mine dewatering was cause for concern. Therefore, this study was initiated to: provide a baseline on surface water quality and elements in biota in the mid to lower Humboldt River basin and to evaluate trends; determine if water quality standards were protective of fish, wildlife, and habitat; and attempt to determine relative loads of contaminants entering the Humboldt Wildlife Management Area that originated from mine dewatering and irrigation drainage. Mine dewatering discharges to the Humboldt River or its tributaries occurred from the Newmont Gold Quarry and Lone Tree Mines and the Barrick Goldstrike Mine. Aquatic vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish were collected from eight sites along the Humboldt River, including sites both upstream and downstream of mine dewatering discharge points. Sediment, aquatic vegetation, macroinvertebrates, fish, and bird eggs and livers were collected from the Humboldt Wildlife Management Area. Sampling at all sites was conducted in 1998 and 1999, and four sites along the river in 2000. Samples were analyzed for an array of elements. Data on water quality in the Humboldt River as well as mine dewatering discharges were evaluated. The U.S. Geological Survey conducted an associated study on water and sediment quality in the lower portion of the basin, and estimated loads of contaminants in the river from various sources, with results provided in a separate report. Element concentrations in algae varied widely among sample locations and years. Magnesium and strontium concentrations in algae tended to increase in a downstream direction. Molybdenum concentrations were markedly higher downstream of the Lone Tree Mine discharge point than at all other locations; however, the source is unclear. Recommendations are made for future sampling, which include information on sample types, locations, elements analyzed, frequency of sampling, and a possible more holistic study approach. There is no clear evidence that mine dewatering discharges had an adverse effect on biological resources in the Humboldt River.",
