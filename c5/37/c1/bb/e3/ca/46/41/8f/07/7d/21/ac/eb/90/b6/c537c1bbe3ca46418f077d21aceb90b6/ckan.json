    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Effective multi-level autonomous piloting systems require integration with safety-critical functions. The Expandable Variable-Autonomy Architecture&amp;nbsp;(EVAA)&amp;nbsp;project seeks to develop a hierarchal autonomous system framework that will depend on deterministic systems with higher authority to protect against catastrophic piloting faults and allow a lower level certification for the machine learning sub-systems. The multi-layered approach provides the framework for analytical systems that can learn, predict, and adapt to both routine and emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to develop an autonomous piloting system based on analytical and learning algorithms that are capable of making effective decisions, in both nominal and potentially catastrophic situations. This will develop a safety critical framework for certification of complex autonomous systems where a small but sufficient number of levels. The system will be integrated with a certified safety critical decision makers (such as vehicle health monitoring, collision avoidance, loss of control avoidance and restricts commands of higher level critical decision makers not certified to level A software. The project will integrate these systems onto a quad-rotor micro-UAV for inexpensive and quick flight testing of concepts and develop customized, low power hardware to house the control and decision making algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS: The purpose of this CIF project is not to develop a full scale aircraft capable of these types of advancements, but only to develop a piloting system which make them possible. Initially, decisions associated with &amp;ldquo;where to fly&amp;rdquo; will be focused on and integrated into the algorithms. For this slice of the pie, the system will be required to navigate a potentially changing dense urban landscape. Routes will be planned based on time, distance, and potential risk. Additionally, terrain and obstacle avoidance algorithms will restrict these activities based on preloaded obstacle and terrain maps. Additionally, off nominal conditions such as loss of motor or other non-pre-programmed events will cause the aircraft to select landing or crashing locations based on population density maps, location of buildings, and other information. A hangar or small area will be turned into the urban city-center mockup with maps created of the mockup to facilitate flight test of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date: &lt;/strong&gt;The hierarchical decision chain and framework, hardware, and embedded processing related to ground collision avoidance is in place for a sub-scale platform. Flight tests on a quad-rotor model helicopter demonstrated successful limitation of flight decisions when facing imminent ground collision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead: &lt;/strong&gt;The team is developing a full set of safety-critical functions for the sub-scale platforms and working to scale up to larger UAVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partners: &lt;/strong&gt;University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University are developing algorithms, and the FAA is participating in the certification process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases safety: &lt;/strong&gt;Integration of safety-critical functions improves outcomes in emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifiable: &lt;/strong&gt;Removal of safety-critical functions from the autonomous control enables adaptable processes to be certified to a lower level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UAVs and unmanned submersibles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autonomous rail transport&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep space exploration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Driverless vehicles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
