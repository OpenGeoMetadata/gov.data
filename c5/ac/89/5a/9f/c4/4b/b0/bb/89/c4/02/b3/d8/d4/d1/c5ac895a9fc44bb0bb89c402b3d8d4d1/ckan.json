    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In response to NASA SBIR topic A1.05, \"Data Mining for Integrated Vehicle Health Management\", Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) asserts that our unique SPADE (Sparse Processing Applied to Data Exploitation) technology meets a significant fraction of the stated criteria and has functionality that enables it to handle many applications within the aircraft lifecycle. SPADE distills input data into highly quantized features and uses MAC's novel techniques for constructing Ensembles of Decision Trees to develop extremely accurate diagnostic/prognostic models for classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection and semi-supervised learning tasks. These techniques are currently being employed to do Threat Assessment for satellites in conjunction with researchers at the Air Force Research Lab. Significant advantages to this approach include: 1) completely data driven; 2) training and evaluation are faster than conventional methods; 3) operates effectively on huge datasets (&gt; billion samples X &gt; million features), 4) proven to be as accurate as state-of-the-art techniques in many significant real-world applications.  The specific goals for Phase 1 will be to work with domain experts at NASA and with our partners Boeing, SpaceX and GMV Space Systems to delineate a subset of problems that are particularly well-suited to this approach and to determine requirements for deploying algorithms on platforms of opportunity.
