  "notes": "This project was a joint effort between NC Emergency Management, NC Geodetic Survey, and the NCDOT. The following people served as the main representatives for each stakeholder: NC Emergency Management- Hope Morgan(primary contact) and John Dorman; NC Geodetic Survey- Gary Thompson and Steve Kauffman; NCDOT- Keith Johnston and Marc Swartz. The United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Resources Conservation Service(NRCS)were also stakeholders and their representative roles can be found in the project coordination Issue Papers. The data set was collected specific to the 2014 Phase Two project area consisting of 20 North Carolina counties which are listed below in the \"Place Keywords\" section of this metadata record. The LiDAR was collected between January 30 and March 13 of 2014, at nominal post spacing of 0.7 meters or better for a total project area of 14,500 square miles. Three sensors were used for the data collection; two Leica ALS70HP-II (serial numbers 7198 and 7123) and an Optech Pegasus HA500 (serial number 13SEN303). All data was collected during leaf-off conditions and the three coastal counties within the project area were collected during low tide conditions. Ground survey support for the project included the establishment of GPS base stations and the collection of control points used for calibration. All data was delivered in the North Carolina State Plane Coordinate System, with a horizontal datum of NAD83 (2011), vertical datum of NAVD88 (Geoid 12A), in US Survey Feet (vertical units later changed to meters). Data was delivered tiled to a 5,000 foot by 5,000 foot tiling scheme unless otherwise specified in this product description. All LiDAR was delivered in LASer (LAS) version 1.3 standard format. Products for this project derived from the source LiDAR included: intensity images in GeoTIFF format, hydro-flattening breaklines in ESRI File Geodatabase format, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in ESRI Grid format, ESRI Terrain Datasets (by county) in ESRI File Geodatabase format, product and project-level metadata, and project reports to include the Report of Survey, Post-Acquisition Report, and Project Report. All LiDAR and derivative products for this project met the specifications stipulated in Delivery Order 59 and the NC LiDAR Standard. Original title was \"2014 LiDAR Acquisition and Associated Products for Phase Two Counties in North Carolina\". The title was modified by NOAA Office for Coastal Management for consistency with the phase one collection and to reflect that this metadata accompanies only the derived DEM. NOAA also changed the vertical units to meters and file format to GeoTIFF for ingestion into the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer.",
