    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED light sources are ideal for plant growth systems. However, commercially available multi-color LED illumination panels are designed and manufactured to produce a single particular illumination. These panels have very specific LED colors arranged in a very specific fashion. This limits the amount of color mixing, intensity variation, and spatial arrangement that is possible, precluding passive precision illumination. There is no feedback mechanism to detect spectral shifts caused by LED aging and additionally, there is no mechanism to modulate LEDs. It is also not possible to integrate an imaging system into these panels. Furthermore, these panels are commonly operated using high voltage AC power sources, which is not ideal in a potentially wet environment. Therefore, to address these issues, custom LED illumination panels were designed and developed for this project&amp;rsquo;s plant growth chamber.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A systematic approach was taken to determine the general size, specifications, and shape of a portable plant growth unit. Once the general size and shape were finalized, the detailed design of the support structure, aeroponics, and lighting subsystems were developed. Particular attention was given to heat transfer and the expected LED thermal environment.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;computational analysis was performed to determine optimal LED nodes placement so that two different uniform illumination fields could be yielded:&amp;nbsp; (1) for germinating plants, lower intensity light, and (2) for larger maturing plants, a brighter one.&amp;nbsp; Also, aeroponic studies were reviewed to identify an efficient and user-friendly system that would require minimal user involvement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
