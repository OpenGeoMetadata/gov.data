The data are derived from 1:24,000 scale maps of individual districts showing boundaries that correspond to tax parcel data. District data is joined into a file representing an entire county. Note that 2003 legislation allows lands to be added to districts on an annual basis. Electronic data provided here may predate those additions. It is important to reference the current tax parcel list for each district to confirm the precise agricultural district boundary. Tax parcel detail and secondary rights-of-way are not included in this dataset. Rights-of-way for state and federal highways, railroads and utilities are only included when they are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps. The data files are in ArcInfo 8.3 export file format.",
