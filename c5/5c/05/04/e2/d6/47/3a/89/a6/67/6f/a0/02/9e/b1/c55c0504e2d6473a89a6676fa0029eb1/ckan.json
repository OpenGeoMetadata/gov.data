  "notes": "Free-ranging bison (Bison bison) were reintroduced to Jackson Hole from the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park in Grand Teton National Park in 1969. By March 1996, the herd had grown from 16 animals to approximately 255. A number of unresolved bison management issues, some of which were controversial, led to the development of this Jackson Bison Herd Management Plan and Environmental Assessment by Grand Teton National Park (National Park Service) and the National Elk Refuge (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) in cooperation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and the Bridger-Teton National Forest (U.S. Forest Service). Since 1987, when a draft environmental assessment and management plan for the Jackson bison herd (JBH) was released but not adopted, the level of monitoring of the herd has increased and several studies of the herd's biology and ecology have been completed. That biological information, the results of two public scoping efforts in 198 7 and 1991, and the agencies' concerns and responsibilities were integrated to form the goals and objectives of the draft Jackson Bison Herd Management Plan and Environmental Assessment released in November 1994. Public response to that draft Plan (see Appendix IV) and additional biological information provided the basis for changes that have been incorporated into this final Management Plan and Environmental Assessment. The plan's overall management goal is to maintain a free-rangipg bison herd in Jackson Hole, as free from human intervention as practically possible. The management objectives are: 1. to maintain a self-sustaining population, 2. to minimize the potential for transmission of brucellosis (with which some bison are infected) among bison, elk, and domestic livestock, 3. to reduce the dependency of bison on supplemental feed to the extent practical, 4. to maintain recreational opportunities associated with a free-ranging bison herd, and 5. to minimize the potential for bison-human conflicts and property damage caused by bison.",
