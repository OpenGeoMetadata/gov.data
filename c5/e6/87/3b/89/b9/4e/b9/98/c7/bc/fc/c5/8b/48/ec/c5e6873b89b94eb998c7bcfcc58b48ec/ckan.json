    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Automated Ply Inspection (API) system autonomously inspects layups created by high speed automated fiber placement (AFP) machines. API comprises a high accuracy line scanner to measure surface topology of as-made layups driven by a precision articulated arm Robot to perform rapid surface scanning of a Layup after tape placement and layup. Key to API is efficient and robust software to read very large volumes of line scan data and analyze, classify and detect key Layup features very rapidly and reliably. The software retains only key features, filtering the raw data by two orders of magnitude to facilitate real-time data processing at high scan rates. Software also compares the location of as-made features (gaps, overlaps, drops and adds)with the NC program (\"virtual layup\") to identify and record only those as-made features that are out of tolerance.     API addresses many of NASA's objectives for this topic:   ? Manufacturing for launch vehicles  ? Innovative automated process (AFP)  ? Applies to reliable, large scale PMC structure  ? Applies to Autoclave and OOA AFP methods    API provides a powerful capability to enhance reliability of structures manufactured by AFP by automating a tedious and difficult manual task. In fact, the speed of AFP machines today has advanced such that manual inspection now takes as much time, and often more, than automated layup requires. API can significantly increase total AFP productivity (C-rate) and reduce cost by reducing Inspection time.  Flightware has enlisted the participation of two other small businesses in this program to contribute their experience and expertise as subcontractors for specific tasks. Furthermore we have attracted the interest of larger industry leaders who supply AFP equipment and manufacture AFP Aerospace parts in this program, because they recognize its potential value.      This API program is a manufacturing innovation subject to Executive Order 13329 \"Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing.\"",
