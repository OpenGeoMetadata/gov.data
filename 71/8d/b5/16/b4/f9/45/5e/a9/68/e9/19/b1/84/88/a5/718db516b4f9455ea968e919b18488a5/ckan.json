    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In a successful Phase 1 project for NASA SBIR topic A1.05, \"Data Mining for Integrated Vehicle Health Management,\" Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) demonstrated its SPADE anomaly detection software to key personnel in NASA's Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) and with data from our partners at Boeing, SpaceX and GMV Space Systems.  The feedback from these demonstrations was used to establish future development directions for Phase 2. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 will consist of three major efforts: 1) the design and implementation of the Taiga system, a next-generation enhancement of the SPADE software, 2) an investigation into combining complementary functionality of Taiga with existing code at ISD including the Inductive Modeling System, Mariana and others, and 3) the implementation of a prototype automatic parallelizer, in cooperation with subcontractor Optillel Solutions, for a subset of C++ useful for hardware acceleration of machine learning applications.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the interaction with researchers in NASA ISD will be to explore the relationships between IMS and Taiga and gauge benefits such a Data Handling, Feature Reduction, Visualization and Explainability. We will also investigate heterogeneous ensemble methods by analyzing the Mariana system.\r\n\r\nOptillel's C++ Parallelizer will reduce MAC's development costs for parallelizing C++ code for multi-core chips and clusters. This effort will build on Optillel's existing body of work that supports graphical programming languages, and will extend their technology to the analysis and parallelization of C++ code.\r\n\r\nBoth the Taiga system and Optillel's prototype have significant commercialization potential in industries as diverse as Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing and Aerospace.",
