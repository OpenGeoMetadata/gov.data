    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;We propose to develop and test a proof of concept prototype for a standard CubeSat form factor platform, designed for missions to &lt;u&gt;deep space&lt;/u&gt; targets, as opposed to the conventional LEO CubeSat venue to date.&amp;nbsp; In testing, we will focus on the &amp;ldquo;tall poles&amp;rdquo; identified in the FY13 LunarCube IRAD study, for a variety of lunar targets. Tall poles include thermal issues, radiation effects, adequate power, communication links, limited mass and volume for subsystems, and propulsion from Earth to the target. Lunar applications, like the LWaDi &lt;u&gt;l&lt;/u&gt;unar &lt;u&gt;wa&lt;/u&gt;ter &lt;u&gt;di&lt;/u&gt;stribution CubeSat orbiter, typically have major thermal challenges as a &amp;ldquo;tall pole&amp;rdquo;, especially when the detectors need to be cooled or the packaging is very dense.&amp;nbsp; For this IRAD, we will &lt;em&gt;perform relevant thermal vacuum testing of the prototype platform using the detailed LWaDi mission thermal profile, to confirm that the design for LWaDi and similar missions will work and to drive the deep space CubeSat platform to a design level that is ready for external proposals&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Other constraints, including propulsion, power, attitude control, C&amp;amp;DH, and communications, will continue to be analyzed in parallel with thermal testing, and relevant, reusable COTS parts will be included in the prototype, per available funding.&amp;nbsp; It should be noted that the discipline engineering team assembled for the FY13 IRAD will be available to significantly advance the prototype model. The &lt;u&gt;end product&lt;/u&gt; will be a hardware CubeSat bus design (6U for deployment at the final target, 9U for deployment from GEO requiring a robust propulsion system to reach the target) that is understood from thermal, mechanical, and other perspectives, and ready for flight development.&amp;nbsp; As an additional payoff, we will also work to apply relevant test results to other mission profiles that we are developing, including impactors and surface instruments based on CubeSat standards, with various trajectories and life times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we propose to deliver a detailed design and development plan, and to test a prototype of the optical subsystem, the component which represent the greatest &amp;lsquo;compactness&amp;rsquo; challenge of a compact yet capable version of a cubesat &amp;lsquo;work horse&amp;rsquo; instrument, an extremely compact (&amp;lt;2U) high spectral resolution (10nm), broadband IR spectrometer capable of measuring volatiles (water type and component, organics) and Fe- and Ti-bearing mineral distribution on a broad range of solar system bodies, including the Moon, where we propose to use it to determine water type (bound, adsorbed, ice) and component distribution from spectral features in the 1.3 to 3.7 um range for the LWaDi (Lunar Water Distribution) mission.&lt;/p&gt;",
