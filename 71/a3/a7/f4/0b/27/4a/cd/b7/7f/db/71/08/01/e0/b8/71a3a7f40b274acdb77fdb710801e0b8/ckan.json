    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "FUTEK will fully design and manufacture a sensor capable of measuring forces in and about each axis.  The unit will measure forces up to 300 Newton's in the principle axes and measure moment forces about each axis up to 50 Newton meters.  The overall design will be optimized for a multitude of applications in many different environments.  As a result, the unit is capable of surviving temperatures ranging from -135&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C and 125&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C and will remain operable within specification between -80&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C and 70&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.  In addition, the sensor will be designed to accommodate vacuum conditions and all components will be covered with a protective coating.  To further improve the unit, the size and weight has been minimized, making the sensor more ideal for dynamic applications and less obtrusive in assembly design.  During the phase 1 contract, FUTEK has developed two operating prototypes to prove concept and feasibility.  Also, different adhesives and coatings have been successfully tested beyond the survival temperatures expected in most applications.  However, a continuation into phase 2 will be necessary to optimize the final design and meet all specifications and requirements.  The design will be optimized to support specified loads with an acceptable factor of safety, while components are further researched and selected.  In addition, the manufacturability and market of the product will be analyzed and assessed in order to commercialize such an advanced sensor.",
