  "notes": "The 'Pit Study' was meant to identify the remnants of former oil extraction sites which pose the threat of creating an oil spill. These remnants include many other items besides the pits suggested by the study title. e.g. tank batteries, collection and separation apparatus, metering stations and wells. In these coastal water areas, erosion frequently exposes oil production elements that were formerly buried or on land, such as pipelines and manifold headers. Additionally, the cribbing surrounding a well may decay or fall away, leaving the well exposed. These exposed elements are susceptible to damage by boat traffic as well as a hazard to navigation. Pits of most concern are generally associated with production facilities and tank batteries where oil from multiple wells is collected. These pits were used for trash and as an emergency overflow for oil. Pits associated with wells themselves (Non-hazardous Oilfield Waste or NOW pits) generally only contained drilling fluids, rarely oil. These data are held in a point dataset [pit_study_LOSCO_1998] representing all completed phases of the project - phases 1-7. The point dataset may be linked to five other database files ([opametalsap7] [oparemactap7] [opawellidap7] [opasampleap7] [opaassessap7])that include attributes related to sampling performed at the site, the assessors who made the observations, well cross reference numbers, and recommended remedial action. The data set includes an ArcView project file to display the data and make all these appropriate linkages. The subjects of the pit study were identified through a variety of sources including NASA Aerial Photography, Landsat imagery, and oil well drilling/extraction permit data. It is important to note that the permitting process was not implemented until the mid 1940's, whereas the oil exploration/production in Louisiana commenced about 1906. This means there are many wells present which were never documented in a permit. Furthermore, poor location reference points in swampy areas, coupled with some operator independence, means that even permitted wells may have been located 200-300 feet from their permitted location. The contractors for LOSCO used this information as a guide for areas to investigate for potential oil spill sources. In the field, they noted all apparatus and pits with this potential, even if they were not looking for them in particular. The positions of these features were determined with GPS. The data associated with each point includes feature type, observations on the feature, and in some cases, photographs and/or site plans.",
