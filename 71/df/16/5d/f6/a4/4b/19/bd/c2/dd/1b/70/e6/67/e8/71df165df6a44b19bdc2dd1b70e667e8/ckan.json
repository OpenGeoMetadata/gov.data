    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "To support NASA's vital interest in developing much larger solar array structures over the next 20 years, MotionPort LLC's Phase I SBIR project will strengthen validated modeling analysis and simulation techniques by developing a vertical application to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of the various stages of deployable space structures.  This application which will support RecurDyn Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) software, acquired by NASA in 2013, will increase efficiency and reduce errors, time and the need for advanced knowledge.  Currently, modeling complex flexible body non-linear structures can be time consuming and prone to error. Existing nonlinear structural analysis simulation software does not effectively simulate structural assemblies with significant motion. Creation of a custom vertical application for the simulation of deployable space structures would provide a large reduction in the specialized knowledge needed to develop models and would automate tedious tasks. \r\n  The proposed innovations of this Phase I SBIR project are:\r\n  1. A focused vertical software application for the dynamic simulation of the rollup, deployment and maneuvering operation of large solar array structures consisting of a set of functions that are layered on commercial Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) simulation software that also has the capability of the nonlinear simulation of flexible (Finite-Element [FE] or mesh-based) bodies; and\r\n  2. Development of an active, nonlinear controller that will reduce the deflection of a roll-out solar array (ROSA) during spacecraft maneuvers. This development includes the creation and use of a unique simulation environment that couples the controller simulation with the nonlinear structural response of the ROSA.\r\n  The Phase II project will add capabilities and improve integration of functions, including new support of the simulation of lanyards and tape springs. Additional type of deployable space structures can be simulated, including antennas.",
