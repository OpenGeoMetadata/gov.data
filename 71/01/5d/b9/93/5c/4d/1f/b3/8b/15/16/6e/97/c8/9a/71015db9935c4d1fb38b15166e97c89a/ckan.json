    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Paragon Space Development Corp (Paragon) and Thin Red Line Aerospace (TRLA) proposes to explore the utilization of inflatable structures by designing a habitation module as an integrated, all-fabric inflatable structural architecture, rather than modifying rigid space structural designs with an inflatable envelope. Paragon and TRLA have developed several concepts with the potential to eliminate the need for hard-material support structure within an inflated habitat. A key feature of the proposed solution is the focus on eliminating the need to connect to or compromise the air-barrier thus creating a structure with highly predictable load performance and minimal leak rate. The proposed activity will address primary and secondary structures in an integrated fashion with consideration of innovative approaches of addressing the assembly, integration, and deployment of all structures to minimize launch volume and mass while providing cost savings and maximizing usable living space. This includes floors, walls, Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) elements, thermal control fluid loops, insulation, radiation shielding, MMOF protection, and electrical data support, while providing a stable, secure support for interior hard-goods into an all-inflatable design that can be efficiently packaged.\r\n\r\nInflatable structures exhibit the highest specific stiffness of any known structure and can produce significant weight savings over hybrid structural designs. Paragon's multi-pressure vessel concept utilizes nested pressure vessels to form a multiwall structure entirely encapsulated and independent of the outer hull and air barrier material to ensure minimum leak rate. An ECLSS induced pressure differential exists between a central core, the inner habitable volume walls, and the exterior pressure hull and air barrier material. Perforations in the core and inner walls allow continuous airflow providing air revitalization and heat removal.",
