  "notes": "This report summarizes nesting data. Observations include: 1. The Conine Creek colony was comprised of > 150 great egret and > 75 great blue heron nests. 2. The Conoho Creek colony was comprised of 40 great blue heron nests. About 90% of the nests were active. 3. Eggs were sampled from seven nests at Conine Creek and ten nests at Conoho Creek. Clutch size ranged from 2 to 5 with an average of 3.76 eggs per nest. No differences were detected between colonies. 4. Nesting histories are summarized in Figure 3. Of the 11 nests that hatched one or more young, hatching success was 82.9%. No differences were detected between colonies. 5. We observed no gross embryonic abnormalities in the sampled embryos. 6. Eggshell thickness averaged 0.403mm, no differences between colony were seen. The Ratcliffe Index for both colonies was 1.98. 7. Attempts to assess fledgling success were unsuccessful. PCDDs and PDCFs 1. The 2,3,7,8-TCDD congener was detected in one sample at 11 pg/g (wet weight) and was below detection (<3 to <10 pg/g) in nine eggs. The 2,3,7,8-TCDF congener was not detected in any samples (<1 to <10 pg/g depending on extent of matrix interferences). 2. In the extended scans performed on two samples, 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF was detected at 12 and .17 pg/g, and OCDD was detected in one sample at 11 pg/g. Calculated 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQ) for the two eggs in which residues were detected are 2 pg/g and 12 pg/g (Table 1). 3. For the non-2,3,7,8-substituted isomers, total TCDD was < 1 pg/g, total PeCDD ranged from 10 to 13 pg/g, HxCDD and HpCDF were < 5 pg/g, total TCDF ranged from 120 to 260 pg/g, total PeCDF ranged from 85 to 230 pg/g, total HxCDF ranged from 85 to 220 pg/g, and total HpCDF was detected at 54 and 150 pg/g.",
