    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The John C. Stennis Space Center's primary mission is testing rocket propulsion systems and components for the Space Shuttle and for future generations of space vehicles.  Research to develop new instrumentation technologies and techniques for test facility monitoring and control during propulsion testing includes the need for instrumentation to improve reliability and performance of ground test facilities.  Current sensors can not survive the harsh conditions (high pressures and high flow rates) that are required for ground based rocket propulsion systems testing.  Luna Innovations proposes to develop a high-speed, cryogenic fiber optic temperature sensor housed in a ruggedized, aerodynamic probe to increase sensing capabilities for ground-based rocket testing.  Luna will be teaming with the Aerospace Department at a partnering university to develop a materials-compatible housing designed for survivability in high flow and high pressure cryogenic conditions.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling will be conducted to optimize the aerodynamic design for frequency response and ruggedization of the sensor and housing.  Special attention will be given to designing smart features into the sensor, such as self-diagnostics to monitor sensor health, and on-board storage of calibration data.",
