  "notes": "This image represents a 4 meter resolution bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep canyons and slopes of the NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The M-I907-NF-12 survey was split into two sites: W00221 in the west and W00222 in the east. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the Northeast Grand Reserve from 4/08/2012 to 4/20/2012. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2012 acquisition software. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
