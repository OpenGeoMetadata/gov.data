    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing security penetration testing and anomaly detection defense studies were conducted to assess the adequacy of cloud computing security.&amp;nbsp; Since cloud computing involves data distributed over wide areas and multiple devices being shared by unrelated users, the security challenges become increasingly complex.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, with the advent of cyber warfare as a threat, protecting data from theft or alteration does not in itself neutralize the threat, as the adversary also seeks to disrupt critical infrastructure and services such as penetration into data center server networks, and automated security access control.&amp;nbsp; It has therefore become increasingly important to complement security capabilities with advances in automated intelligence (AI) to recognize the plans of multiple agent threats (software or human) based on the observation of their activities. Therefore, for this project, an autonomous micro-modular mobile data center was used as a test/demonstration platform to study cloud computing security.&lt;/p&gt;",
