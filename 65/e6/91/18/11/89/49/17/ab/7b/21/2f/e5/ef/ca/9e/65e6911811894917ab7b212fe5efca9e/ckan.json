    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "IMS: Inductive Monitoring System \r\n\r\nThe Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) is a tool that uses a data mining technique called clustering to extract models of normal system operation from archived data. IMS works with vectors of data values. IMS analyzes data collected during periods of normal system operation to build a system model. It characterizes how the parameters relate to one another during normal operation by finding areas in the vector space where nominal data tends to fall. These areas are called nominal operating regions and correspond to clusters of similar points found by the IMS clustering algorithm. These nominal operating regions are stored in a knowledge base that IMS uses for real-time telemetry monitoring or archived data analysis.  \r\n\r\nDuring the monitoring operation, IMS reads real-time or archived data values, formats them into the predefined vector structure, and searches the knowledge base of nominal operating regions to see how well the new data fits the nominal system characterization. For each input vector, IMS returns the distance that vector falls from the nearest nominal operating region. Data that matches the normal training data well will have a deviation distance of zero. If one or more of the data parameters is slightly outside of expected values, a small non-zero result is returned. As incoming data deviates further from the normal system data, indicating a possible malfunction, IMS will return a higher deviation value to alert users of the anomaly. IMS also calculates the contribution of each individual parameter to the overall deviation, which can help isolate the cause of the anomaly. ",
