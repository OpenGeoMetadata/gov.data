  "notes": "A group of eight tidal creeks dominated by oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on detailed geomorphological observations from North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight small intertidal creeks had been selected based on similarities in size and configuration. During fall of 1996, the naturally occurring oyster biomass was estimated by measuring reef area in each creek and quantifying oyster biomass in square meter quadrats randomly collected from field surveys within each creek. This initial survey revealed an average biomass of about 8 grams dry body weight of oysters per cubic meter of water volume at bank full levels based on all eight creeks. In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank-full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. About one year later in February 1998, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This stage of the project is considered the \"manipulation\" period where four of the creeks have had all of the oyster biomass removed. The same month (February 1998) that the four creeks had their living oysters removed (manipulated creeks), oyster reef area and biomass for the unmanipulated creeks were estimated using quadrat sampling. The period after this is considered the \"post-manipulation\" stage. About two years later during the post-manipulation period, a final biomass estimate was performed in May 2000 to determine if oyster recruitment and trampling during sampling activities had altered oyster biomass during the manipulation phase of the study. The database file 'Final CREEK Oyster Biomass Estimates' contains data from the initial naturally occurring biomass survey in Fall 1996, the biomass of oysters in each creek in January and May 1997 following adjustments to equalize biomass to 8 g dry body weight per cubic meter, the biomass survey in February 1998 of unmanipulated creeks following removal of oysters from manipulated creeks, and data from the final biomass survey in May 2000. The final estimate data are in tabular form and are based on detailed field surveys of creek geomorphology (see CREEK Geomorphology database).",
