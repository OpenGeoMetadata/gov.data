  "notes": "During the first 10 days of- March, 1950;, after a period of cold weather had sheathed: the tidal flats in ice, there was a moderate loss of wintering Black Ducks in the Parker River region of Essex county, Massachusetts, and a slight loss at one point in Plymouth county. This report describes the conditions and events before and during the tins of mortality, and gives the results of a pathological examination of some 75 birds which were picked up dead or caught by hand when they had lost the power of sustained flight. The death of Black Ducks from winter starvation on the New England coast north of Cape Cod can no longer be considered either debatable or of minor importance. The losses have been under study by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation for 12 years now, and Palmer (Maine Birds: pages 77-80) has recently published data which leave no doubt, that they take place on the coast of Maine. The Massachusetts investigation has uncovered evidence of periodic losses as far back as the winter of 1911-12, and ha- built up a fairly complete record of the antecedent conditions and the pattern of mortality. It has included also a search for effective ways of reducing the losses. Methods of feeding whole corn in emergencies were worked out experimentally in the years prior to 1942, and in the winter of 1947-48 were put to an impromptu but decidedly practical test. In late January of that season, 6700 Blacks in the Parker River region were brought to the verge of starvation by the icing of their feeding grounds. On the Essex River, a feeding, program was hastily organized and the estimated loss among the 3000 tending ducks was held below 5%. At the  mouth of the Ipswich River feeding operations were not so prompt and the confirmed loss in a group of 3700 Blacks exceeded 50%. The difference in rates  of mortality was a rough measure of what can be done with proper feeding, for  every other significant variable was eliminated by the fact that the two areas are only four miles apart, and essentially similar The 1950 mortality in Essex county develop d at the same places as in 1908, and so far as it went, followed a similar course. It was thus another chapter in a continued story, and much of its significance depends upon this relationship to its, background. An account of the previous studies has been available only in departmental reports of limited circulation. To fill in background for readers of the present report, pertinent findings from other yearn have been summarized wherever they seemed to be needed, usually at the beginning of a section. These summaries are condensed, lest they interrupt continuity, but it is believed they cover every point which, is required for an understanding of the lose losses.",
