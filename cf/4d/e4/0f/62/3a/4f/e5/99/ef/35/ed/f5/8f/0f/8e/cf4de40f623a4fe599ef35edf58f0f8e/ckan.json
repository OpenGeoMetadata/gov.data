    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The reprocessed OMI/Aura Level-2 zoomed cloud data product OMCLDO2Z at 13x12 km resolution is now available ( http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldo2z_v003.shtml ) from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) for the public access. It is the second release of Version 003 and was reprocessed late 2011.\n\nOMI provides two cloud products based on two different algorithms, the Rotational Raman Scattering method and O2-O2 absorption method using the DOAS technique. This level-2 zoomed cloud product at the pixel resolution (13x12 km2 at nadir) is based on the spectral fitting of O2-O2 absorption band at 477 nm using DOAS technique. This product contains effective cloud pressure, effective cloud fraction, slant column O2-O2; uncertainties in derived, parameters, terrain and geolocation information, solar and satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. \n\n(The shortname for this Level-2 OMI Zoomed cloud product is OMCLDO2Z)  \nThe lead scientist for this product is Dr. Pepijn Veefkind.\n\nOMCLDO2Z  files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes) and is roughly 20 MB in size. OMCLDO2Z data files are based on Zoomed Level 1B radiance observations which are  made once a month. Thus there is one zoomed cloud product per month.\n A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml\nA Readme document containing brief algorithm description and  known data quality related issues and  file spec are  provided by the OMCLDO2 Algorithm lead",
