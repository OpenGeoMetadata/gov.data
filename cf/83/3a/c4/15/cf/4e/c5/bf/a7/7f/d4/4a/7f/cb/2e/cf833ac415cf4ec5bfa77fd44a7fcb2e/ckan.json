    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains the calculated net ocean-air carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and sea-air CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) difference. The estimates are based on approximately one million measurements made for the pCO2 in surface waters of the global ocean since the International Geophysical Year, 1956-1959. Only the ocean water pCO2 values measured using direct gas-seawater equilibration methods were used. The results represent the climatological distributions under non-El Nino conditions. Since the measurements were made in different years, during which the atmospheric pCO2 was increasing, they were corrected to a single reference year (arbitrarily chosen to be 1995) on the basis of the following assumptions: -Surface waters in subtropical gyres mix vertically at slow rates with subsurface waters due to the presence of strong stratification at the base of the mixed layer. This will allow a long contact time with the atmosphere to exchange CO2. Therefore, their CO2 chemistry tends to follow the atmospheric CO2 increase. Accordingly, the pCO2 measured in a given month and year is corrected to the same month of the reference year 1995 using changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration occurred during this period.-Oceanic pCO2 measurements made after the beginning of 1979 have been corrected to 1995 using the atmospheric CO2 concentration data from the GLOBALVIEW-CO2 database (2000), in which the zonal mean atmospheric concentrations (for each 0.05 in sine of latitude) within the planetary boundary layer are summarized for each month since 1979 to 2000.-Pre-1979 oceanic pCO2 data were corrected to 1979 using the annual mean trend for the global mean atmospheric CO2 concentration constructed from the Mauna Loa data of Keeling and Whorf (2000), and then from 1979 to 1995 using the GLOBALVIEW-CO2 database. -Measurements for pCO2 made in the following areas have been corrected for the time of observation; 45 degrees N, 50  degrees S, in the Atlantic Ocean, north of 50 degrees S in the Indian Ocean, 40 degrees N, 50 degrees S in the western Pacific west of the date line, and 40 degrees N, 60 degrees S, in the eastern Pacific east of the date line.
