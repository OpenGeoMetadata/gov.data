A soil conservation district has established boundaries, usually along county lines, that have the authority to conduct surveys, investigations and research relating to soil erosion and the prevention and control measures needed. They may conduct demonstrations by which soil blowing and soil washing may be prevented and controlled. Soil conservation districts may make available to land occupiers within the district agricultural and engineering machinery and equipment, seeds and seedlings or other equipment for the prevention and control of soil erosion. They may cooperate and enter agreements with other units of government at the local, state and federal level to assist the district in providing for the conservation of the soil and soil resources of the district. Soil conservation districts have comprehensive plans for the conservation of soil resources and the control and prevention of soil erosion within the district. They may carry out education, promotion and recognition activities within their district. A soil conservation district is governed by a board of 3 elected soil conservation district supervisors elected at the time of the General Election, who shall serve for a six-year term. A soil conservation district, upon resolution of the three elected supervisors, may appoint two additional supervisors who shall serve for a term of one year. The supervisors of North Dakota Soil Conservation Districts have the authority to levy a tax, not exceeding one mill, for the payment of the expenses of the district. (The above information is from the North Dakota State Soil Conservation Committee.)",
