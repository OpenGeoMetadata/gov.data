  "notes": " The MIND Laboratory facilitates basic and applied research that transitions neuroscience knowledge and approaches from the laboratory to real-world environments. MIND comprises two core elements, the first of which is a multi-chamber and re-configurable experimental space providing state-of-the-art electrically- and acoustically-controlled environments specifically designed for maximizing neurophysiological, physiological, and behavioral measurement capabilities and data acquisition. Facilities in this space support a wide range of tasks for single- and multi-participant, multi-disciplinary, translational neuroscience research efforts. MIND&amp;#39;s second core element is a computing laboratory with more than a dozen, 8- and 12-core, large memory capacity Linux workstations and a dedicated multi-core distributed computing server that enables the development, implementation, and utilization of advanced computational and algorithmic approaches. These approaches span the potential utilization of Army high performance computing capabilities to the analysis of the multi-channel, high-dimensional data obtained in the MIND experimental facility.
