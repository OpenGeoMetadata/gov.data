  "notes": "The Eco-regional Biodiversity Monitoring (EBM) project is a long-term, large-scale monitoring program to inventory, monitor, and assess priority species and natural communities. Our goal is not only to identify species and habitats of greatest conservation need, but also to produce scientifically sound and quantitative data that can be used to inform land and wildlife management decisions. This project spans two CDFW regions and encompasses four eco-regions (Klamath, Cascades, northern Sierra Nevada, and the Modoc plateau) on an 18.7 million acre study area. The project has been funded by State Wildlife Grants since its inception in the North Central Region in 2009. EBM includes monitoring and data collection components for birds, vegetation, and mammals within each random survey plot. Trail cameras have a significant role in our mammal monitoring due to their cost-effectiveness and high detection rates.The camera data in this file was collected on National Forests and public Lands within CDFW’s North Central Region and the Sierra Nevada eco-region from 2010-2015. Plots were randomly selected from 6 elevation strata above 3,000 feet, with one plot per FIA hexagon. Two camera stations were installed at each survey plot, the 1st camera at plot center, 2nd camera 500m in a random direction, for 2 weeks during June-October. Each camera Station B was baited with oats, , peanut butter, and apple mix on a paper plate on the ground, and strawberry jam was applied to the plate and to the target tree. Small salt blocks were placed next to the plate beginning in 2013. Station A was baited with the same items and also had a raw chicken quarter (leg and thigh) nailed to the target tree at 0.5m height and “Caven’s Gusto” lure (Minnesota Trapline Products, Inc.) applied to the target tree and nearby branches. Camera stations were rebaited and batteries checked after one week.Camera stations were installed 1.5m from ground level facing bait . Camera and bait station were approximately 3m apart. Each station had a unique code marking attached to the target tree within the camera view. Cameras were set to date and time-stamp all photos. Data were downloaded and recorded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.",
