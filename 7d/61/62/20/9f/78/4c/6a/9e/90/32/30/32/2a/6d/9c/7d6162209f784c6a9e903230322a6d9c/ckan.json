    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Deployable Space Systems (DSS) will focus the proposed SBIR program on the development and concept feasibility of an innovative deployable mesh/membrane reflector that enables ultra-lightweight (&lt;0.32 kg/m2 areal mass), affordability (modular based structure that provides high volume produce-ability), precise and repeatable surface accuracy (L, X, Ku &amp; Ka band capable), mechanical and structural simplicity (low parts count), high deployment reliability (relies on proven flight heritage deployment mechanization), high stiffness, compact stowage volume (&gt; 53:1 compaction ratio), scalable to small and very large apertures (up to 50m+ diameter with innovative packaging), and functional deployment capability within a 1G earth gravitational field without requiring an offloader (can also deploy on Mars/Lunar surfaces without an offloader).  The proposed reflector technology is most suitable for offset architectures, and can also accommodate central feeds.  The proposed reflector technology promises affordability and greater performance (lower mass, more compact stowage, larger aperture, and higher deployment reliability) when compared to the current start-of-the-art systems.  The proposed SBIR Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs plan to advanced TRL through higher-fidelity hardware and ever-increasing test relevance.  In partnership with commercial infusion partners DSS plans to rapidly ready this technology for infusion into NASA and non-NASA programs.",
