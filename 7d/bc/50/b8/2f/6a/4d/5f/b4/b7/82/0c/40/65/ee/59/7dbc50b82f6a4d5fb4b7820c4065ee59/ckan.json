    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA seeks advanced high strength and toughness composite materials with the highest microcrack resistance at cryogenic temperatures suitable for use in fuel containment of liquid oxygen, hydrogen, and methane.  Nanotrons Corporation, in collaboration with Prof. Bungki Kim at NSF nanomanufacturing research center in University of Massachusetts Lowell, proposes to develop lightweight functionalized graphene sheets-polymer nanocomposite materials for advanced composite cryotanks.  By uniformly dispersing high performance functionalized graphene sheets through novel polymer matrix the new lightweight nanocomposite will be fabricated and should exhibit significantly increase resin strength and modulus and reduce coefficient of thermal expansion of polymer resin.  The resultant nanocomposite material can much increase the resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperature in ways it has never done before.  The new composite materials also provide additional advantages in forming an impermeable barrier to gas and liquid molecules ideal for fuel tanks.  Nanotrons' proposed new multifunctional nanocomposite based carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite cryotanks will replace the currently used aluminum-lithium cryotanks providing significant weight savings and can be economically scaled-up for manufacturing.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  ",
