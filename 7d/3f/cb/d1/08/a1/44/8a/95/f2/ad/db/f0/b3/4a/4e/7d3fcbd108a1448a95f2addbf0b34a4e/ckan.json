      "description": "The Biophysical Settings (BpS) layer represents the vegetation that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime. Map units are based on NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification and represent the natural plant communities that may have been present during the reference period. Each BpS map unit is matched with a model of vegetation succession, and both serve as key inputs to the LANDSUM landscape succession model. As used in LANDFIRE, map unit names represent the natural plant communities that may have been present during the reference period.\r\nLANDFIRE uses BPS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes. The actual time period for this data set is a composite of both the historical context provided by the fire regime and vegetation dynamics models and the more recent field and geospatial data used to create it.",

      "description": "LANDFIRE developed state-and-transition models to represent pre-settlement reference conditions for all Ecological Systems in the United States through an expert-based model development process. Each model represents a single ecosystem called a Biophysical Setting (BpS) and consists of a quantitative state-and-transition model and a description document published as a pdf. LANDFIRE used the models to estimate reference conditions, which are used to help assess ecosystem health. \"Using the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings Model Descriptions\" examines major elements of the Vegetation Dynamics Models descriptions and their use. The guide book \"Adapting LANDFIRE Vegetation Dynamics Models\" helps users adapt LANDFIRE Vegetation Dynamics Models for use in modeling current and future landscapes. Once adapted, these models may be useful in predicting future vegetation conditions, exploring the impacts of potential environmental changes and comparing the results of different management options.

      "description": "The Environmental Site Potential (ESP) layer represents the vegetation that could be supported at a given site based on the biophysical environment. Map units are based on NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification and represent the natural plant communities that may have been present during the reference period. ESP map units represent the natural plant communities that would become established at late or climax stages of successional development in the absence of disturbance. They reflect the current climate and physical environment, as well as the competitive potential of native plant species. The ESP concept is similar to that used in classifications of potential vegetation, including habitat types and plant associations. ESP is used in LANDFIRE to inform the existing vegetation and fuel mapping processes. ",
