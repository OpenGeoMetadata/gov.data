    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Xinetics is poised to support NASA in answering questions such as:  When and how did the first stars form and what is the history of galaxy evolution and energy/element production in the universe?  We will contribute by developing an Ultra-Lightweight Large Aperture Cryogenic Active Mirror (Ultra-CAM) technology that operates near 5 K.   The Ultra-CAM design will provide an active, lightweight, stiff, large aperture mirror substrate to collect infrared (IR), far-IR and submillimeter (sub-mm) radiation from a space observatory.  Since the Earth?s atmosphere absorbs this part of the electromagnetic spectrum, far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths must be studied in space and at cryogenic temperatures.  These spectrums hold the key to answering these questions.  To avoid radiation noise from the telescope, the telescope including the primary mirror must be maintained near 5 K.  Xinetics? SiC and cryogenic actuator technologies have been performance tested and proven at cryogenic temperatures previously.   Since NASA is planning missions such as the Single Aperture Far-IR telescope (SAFIR) that will require deployable large aperture optics that operate near 5 K, Xinetics intends to develop the Ultra-CAM mirror technology necessary to achieve NASA?s future mission goals for programs such as SAFIR.
