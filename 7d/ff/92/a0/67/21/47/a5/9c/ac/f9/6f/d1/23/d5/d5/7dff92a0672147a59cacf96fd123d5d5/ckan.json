    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) level 2 High-Energy Particle Spectrometer (HEPS) B daily product contains the electron high-resolution spectral data converted to number intensity units from the HEPS telescopes mounted on the nadir UARS boom, and the proton high-resolution spectral data converted to number intensity units from the HEPS telescopes mounted on the zenith boom.  There are no HEPS proton measuring instruments on the nadir boom.  PEM was flown on the UARS spacecraft to measure the type, amount, energy, and distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.\n\nThe PEM HEPS nadir boom electron data covers the rough range from 35 keV to 5 MeV.  There are two telescopes mounted in different directions.  These measure -165 deg and +165 deg with respect to the spacecraft -z-axis and along the spacecraft +x-axis.  The HEPS electron units accumulate a spectrum in 16.384 sec.  The PEM HEPS zenith boom proton data covers the rough range from 70 keV to 150 MeV for mounting angles less than 30 deg and 500 keV to 150 MeV for mounting angles greater than 30 deg.  There are six telescopes mounted in four different directions.  These measure -15 deg, +15 deg, +45 deg, and +90 deg with respect to the spacecraft -z-axis and along the spacecraft +x-axis.  The PEM HEPS proton units accumulate a spectrum in 16.384 sec.  The nadir HEPS electron unit in this file (labeled HEPS3) contains two telescopes (labeled telescope 1 and telescope 2).  Each telescope contains a stack of solid state crystals.  The signals from each of the crystals are combined by energy processing electronics of the instrument to yield two logical crystals or detectors, called the DE and EE detectors.  The DE detector has the rough energy range from 35 keV to 300 keV and the EE detector rough energy range is from 300 keV to 5 MeV.  These designations are used in the description of HEPS electron data.\n                        \nThere is one data file per day for the PEM HEPSB product, and the temporal coverage is from Oct. 1, 1991 to Aug. 23, 2005. Spatial coverage for the HEPSB product ranges between -57 and +57 deg latitude.  The HEPSB data files are written in network binary format. For more information please review the PEM HEPSB data format guide.",
