    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Satellite design encompasses a multitude of steps from concept to flight.  Mission specification to flight can take several years, depending on the scope, requirements and budget of the mission. The process also requires a wide range of design and management tools, with limited consistency data interchange capability, and a lack of coherency.  Detailing the relationships between the satellite configuration, inventory control systems, life cycle management, design, analysis and test data is difficult at best. No tool exists that meets these needs for the general satellite design, system engineering and integration process. Sci_Zone is proposing our innovative Satellite Design Automation architecture SatBuilder Designer, in conjunction with the OpenSAT open database architecture to meet this need. OpenSAT seamlessly integrates existing detail design tools with SatBuilder Designer, as well as databases tracking requirements, components and inventory, with the final configuration of the satellite. SatBuilder Designer, an AI based toolset, provides for rapid design via design wizards and integration to existing design tools; it provides coherency between a range of applications and data sets. OpenSAT stores and distributes supporting satellite design, configuration, mission and test data from a centralized database server and can distribute the data across multiple platforms and via the internet.",
