    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Robots are expected to fulfill an important role in manned exploration operations.  They can reduce the risk of crew EVA and improve crew productivity on routine tasks.  They can be supervised locally by astronauts or remotely by ground control.  In a sense, robots will become members of the operational team.  Just like human teams, these human-robot teams must exchange information, follow established protocols, and coordinate their activities to ensure that mission operations are safe and effective.  Supporting such team operations requires infrastructure for human-robot interaction.  TRACLabs proposes to develop a software framework that facilitates human-robot teaming, from team formation until completion of team operations. We will build on the existing Distributed Collaboration and Interaction (DCI) System, a software multi-agent system developed by TRACLabs to assist human-automation interaction.  DCI provides a software agent for each human team member that delivers services supporting mission duties.  An innovation of this project is providing DCI agents for robots as well as humans in the team.  Another innovation is the use of human models to give robots insight into human behavior to improve interaction.  Phase I will produce a software framework prototype for human-robot interaction and a framework design for implementation in Phase II.  ",
