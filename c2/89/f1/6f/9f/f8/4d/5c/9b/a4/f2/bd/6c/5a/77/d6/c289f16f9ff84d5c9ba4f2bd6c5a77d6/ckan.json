  "notes": " GSCL consists of high-performance CAD stations and associated software located in a secure facility.  Capabilities:  The GSCL provides infrastructure that allows the generation of realistic, conceptual-level ground systems computer models and industrial design ideation for the joint forces. Ground system projects include modifications to existing systems as well as new concepts. The laboratory also allows for classified model generation. The lab&amp;#39;s database contains current and future vehicle conceptual models and technologies, increasing the efficiency of generating new vehicle concepts as well as streamlining modifications to existing ground vehicle systems.  Benefits:  Provides the joint ground systems acquisition, combat developer and S&amp;amp;T communities with the answers to key questions: &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; What are the expected concept weights or system-level weight impacts? &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; What are the overall expected concept system dimensions? &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; What is the concept&amp;#39;s physical architecture? &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; What are the tradeoffs and impacts of different concepts and/or technologies? &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; What are the system-level impacts of operational or technical requirements?
