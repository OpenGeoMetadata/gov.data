    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science applications. These applications require instruments with large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors and precision optical surfaces to gain a better understanding of how the universe works. The hard and soft X-ray mirrors have stringent surface requirements.  If awarded a Phase I our plan would be to combine previous knowledge of OptiPro's UltraSurf metrology system with newly developed software. Our goal would be to create a robust solution for combining the measurement data of the mirrors with corrective machine grinding and polishing process toolpaths.  This proposal includes the investigation utilizing non-contact probes on OptiPro's machining platforms to quantify the potential opportunities for in-situ mirror measurements.  Understanding these surface irregularities and what in the manufacturing processes causes them is critical for improving the current TRL's. OptiPro Systems will develop a metrology system and software, that would provide feedback for manufacturing these precision mirrors and include final metrology measurement of global form error and mid-spatial content. Comparison of in-situ and off-line metrology will be key for improving the manufacturing processes. We envision that the work performed in Phase I would lead to a software and metrology solution to be built and delivered to NASA if awarded a Phase II.  OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities along with our support partnership with the University of Rochester Mechanical Engineering Department, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards solving the difficult challenges for measuring these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells. Our goal is to provide an innovative and complete manufacturing solution for the companies that are fabricating these optical components for NASA.",
