  "notes": "Loggerhead turtles nesting in Japan (i.e. the source rookery for individuals along the U.S. West coast and Pacific Mexico) have recently been declared a Distinct Population Segment (Conant et al. 2008) and listed as Endangered on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (FR 2010). Along the Pacific Coast of Baja, loggerhead turtles have been studied extensively since the late 1990s, resulting in several publications on abundance, local movements, and survivorship (Peckham et al. 2007, 2008, Wingfield et al. 2011, Seminoff et al. In Review). Loggerheads are present along the U.S. west coast and often interact with fisheries operating off of California. In 2003, NMFS issued a time area closure for the Drift Gillnet Fishery to limit loggerhead-fishery interactions within the southern California EEZ. It had long been thought that loggerheads in the Southern California Bight originate from the Mexican foraging population, but recent studies have shown that these turtles come directly from the central North Pacific high seas and recruit directly to California waters (Allen et al. 2012). Pacific Baja and the Southern California Bight are the two primary foraging regions for loggerheads in the eastern North Pacific. MtDNA analysis found significant genetic differences among the 4 loggerhead nesting colonies in Japan and strongly suggests precise natal homing by nesting females (Hatase et al. 2002). Recent technological advances (e.g. longer mtDNA sequences, microsatellites, and SNP¿s) have improved our ability to detect more fine scale population structuring among nesting sites and within foraging areas (LeRoux et al. 2012, Shamblin et al. in prep). Although it has long been understood that loggerheads in the North Pacific originate from Japanese nesting sites, it is not clear if any of the different nesting regions in Japan contributes a proportionally greater amount to a specific feeding aggregation (e.g. north Japan vs. south Japan nesting sites to central North/eastern Pacific vs. Mexico foraging sites). To date no genetic studies published on loggerheads foraging in the eastern North Pacific utilizing the longer mtDNA primers or nuclear markers. Further, so far there is zero information on the time at which it takes to access foraging areas of Baja and the SCB, and thus we are unaware of the temporal susceptibility of loggerheads to\nongoing threats as they move to the eastern North Pacific.\n\nTo determine age at recruitment to this habitat, we sampled 217 annual growth layers from a total of 35 dead-stranded loggerheads from Baja, Mexico for stable isotope analysis using a specialized sequential sampling technique we developed. Stable carbon (&#948;13C) and stable nitrogen (&#948;15N) isotopes were analyzed for each of the 217 samples, and ranged from -21.05 to -14.20 ¿ (¿1.20 SD) for &#948;13C and &#948;15N ranged from 9.86 to 20.55 ¿ (¿1.93 SD). Using skeletochronology, we paired stable isotope values with estimated age for each sample, focusing specifically on the smallest and youngest turtles in order to identify recruitment into neritic habitats. Loggerheads smaller than 45cm curved carapace length (CCL) are uncommon in Baja, Mexico. Using skeletochronology, estimated CCL values were assigned to each of the 217 samples for further size and age-based analysis.  Samples representing turtles larger than 45cm CCL (n = 165) were estimated to be six to 24 years old, and had significantly higher &#948;13C and &#948;15N values than turtles less than 45cm CCL (n = 52; &#948;13C and &#948;15N p < 0.01), which ranged in age from three to six years old. Higher &#948;13C and &#948;15N values are indicators of settlement to neritic habitats, especially in the eastern Pacific. Age-at-recruitment in to neritic habitats is thus estimated at three to six years, based on stable isotope analysis and is also supported by size frequency analysis.\n\nTo pinpoint the residency duration for loggerheads entering this region, we analyzed humerus bones from 146 dead-stranded loggerheads from Baja, Mexico using skeletochronology. The observed age distribution for these turtles ranged from three to 24 years old, suggesting a BCP residency of >20 years. Given the maximum observed age and a one-year migration to nesting beaches in the west Pacific, we estimated age-at-maturity for BCP loggerheads at >25 years old. We also estimated survivorship at varying BCP residency durations by applying our findings to current annual mortality estimates. Survivorship of loggerheads spending over 20 years in this BCP foraging habitat is less than 10%, and given that ~43,000 loggerhead turtles forage here, a significant number of turtles are at extreme risk in this region. This is the first empirical evidence supporting estimated age-at-maturity for BCP North Pacific loggerheads, and the first estimates of BCP stage survivorship. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for continued and effective international conservation efforts to minimize mortality of this endangered species.\n",
