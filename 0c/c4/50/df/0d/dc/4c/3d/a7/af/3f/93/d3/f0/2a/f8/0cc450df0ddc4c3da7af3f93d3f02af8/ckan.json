    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "TRS Technologies proposes novel single crystal piezomotors for large torque, high precision, and cryogenic actuation with capability of position set-hold with power-off for passive optics platforms.  The proposed concept will advance the state-of-art cryogenic rotary motors considering the excellent cryogenic properties of single crystal piezoelectric. This material exhibits d33 and d31 at 30K similar or higher than that of PZT at room temperature and it has a very high electromechanical coupling.  These properties result in an excellent figure of merit for resonant devices. TRS and Va. Tech. will use single crystals to fabricate \"wobbling mode\" and \"flexural traveling wave\"  piezomotors with \"33 mode\" single ring stacks and plate stacks instead of the conventional \"31\" mode plates for excitation. In the Phase I project, FEA modeling considering the special properties of single crystals will be conducted and novel piezomotors with \"33\" mode single crystal ring and plate stacks will be built and characterized at temperatures from 300K to 80K. By the conclusion of Phase I program the feasibility of single crystal piezomotor for cryogenic rotary motion control requiring large torque and high angular resolution  will be demonstrated. The optimum single crystal piezomotor design and the precise cryogenic rotary motion control system development will take place in Phase II.",
