Infiltration-excess overland flow is simulated in TOPMODEL as precipitation that exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil and enters the stream channel. TOPMODEL was applied to 5- by 5-kilometer areas across the conterminous United States using national climate, soils, and terrain geographic information system (GIS) datasets. The model was run for 1,000 days for each 5- by 5-kilometer area. The average percentage of infiltration-excess overland flow in total streamflow was computed for the 1,000-day simulation in each grid cell.",

Uncertainty in the infiltration-excess overland-flow percentages is high because there are many sources of potential error and uncertainty in the TOPMODEL simulations. For example, the climate, soils, and terrain data required by the model are spatially coarse and possibly inaccurate. The spatial coarseness of the climate data produces a noticeable coarseness in the estimated percentages of infiltration-excess overland flow in total streamflow. In some Western States, there are very few meteorological stations for computing the climate characteristics. This data sparseness propagates into the TOPMODEL results and creates a splotchy pattern in the estimated percentage of infiltration-excess overland flow. Another important source of uncertainty in TOPMODEL (and any other model) is termed \\\"model uncertainty.\\\" This type of uncertainty exists because the model is only a simple representation of the hydrologic processes assumed to be most important in determining how water moves through the environment. The estimated flow components from TOPMODEL will be in error to the extent that the model does not represent important complexities in the real hydrologic system.\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]"
