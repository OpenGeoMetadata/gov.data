    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "In this paper, we present an architecture and a formal framework to be used for systematic benchmarking of\r\nmonitoring and diagnostic systems and for producing comparable performance assessments of different diagnostic\r\ntechnologies. The framework defines a number of standardized specifications, which include a fault catalog, a library of modular test scenarios, and a common protocol for gathering and processing diagnostic data. At the center of the framework are 13\r\nbenchmarking metric definitions. The calculation of metrics is\r\nillustrated on a probabilistic model-based diagnosis algorithm\r\nutilizing Bayesian reasoning techniques. The diagnosed system is\r\na real-world electrical power system, namely the Advanced\r\nDiagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) developed and\r\nlocated at the NASA Ames Research Center. The proposed\r\nbenchmarking approach shows how to generate realistic\r\ndiagnostic data sets for large-scale, complex engineering systems,\r\nand how the generated experimental data can be used to enable\r\n“apples to apples” assessments of the effectiveness of different\r\ndiagnostic and monitoring algorithms.",
