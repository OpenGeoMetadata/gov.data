    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a unique coating that uses fluorescence quenching in an entirely new way to provide high resolution images of the true pressure distribution on surfaces in hypersonic flow. IOS will use unique pigments whose fluorescence depends directly on absolute ambient pressure, not on the partial pressure of oxygen in the flow field, to develop coatings that will allow \"legacy\" (oxygen-based) visualization equipment to characterize flows in oxygen-free atmospheres. The new pigments will also be completely compatible with temperature indicating materials and binders currently used in temperature-compensated pressure sensitive paints.\r\nIn Phase I IOS will create two different oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive pigment materials, combine them with a suitable binder, and apply the resulting paints to stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence of these test samples will be measured under varying static pressures of pure nitrogen, and imaged in a low-speed flow environment at varying angles of attack. This will set the stage for Phase II development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels and other facilities where oxygen-independent pressure mapping is needed.",
