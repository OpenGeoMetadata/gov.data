  "notes": " The Doriot Climatic Chambers reproduce environmental conditions occurring anywhere around the world. They provide an invaluable service by significantly reducing the need to conduct actual field testing. In fact, critical human and equipment testing often require very controlled condi&amp;#173;tions that cannot be achieved in the field, or anywhere else. The Chambers can simulate temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, and solar radiation. These conditions can be set up separately or run concurrently. The size and configuration of the chambers provide great flexibility. The dual chambers allow for simultaneous testing in both tropic and arctic environments:  Two 10&amp;#39; H &amp;#215; 15&amp;#39; W &amp;#215; 60&amp;#39; L wind tunnels make it ideal for testing large equipment. Tents, heaters, parachutes, airbeams, medical devices, and windmills have all been tested in the wind tunnels.   The Tropic Wind Tunnel has the ability to create temperatures ranging from 0&amp;#176; F to 165&amp;#176; F with 10 to 90% relative humidity. Rain can be simulated at up to 4&amp;quot; per hr with wind up to 40 mph. Solar load can be simulated with a system consisting of six rows of 250-W light bulbs. The Arctic Wind Tunnel has the ability to create temperatures ranging from -70&amp;#176; F to +120&amp;#176; F with 10 to 90% relative humidity. Rain can also be simulated at rates up to 4&amp;quot; per hr with wind speeds reaching up to 40 mph. The desired conditions of temperature with wind and relative humidity are constantly controlled to within plus or minus 1&amp;#176; F. Two five-person treadmills can run up to 15 mph at a 12% grade in each wind tunnel. There is an external observation area to watch and monitor the testing within the chamber. An in-house kitchen can be used to prepare meals for Soldiers testing or to assess the effects of nutrition on physical performance. The Chambers also contain a dormitory for sleep studies and dressing rooms with showers and laundering facilities.  ",
