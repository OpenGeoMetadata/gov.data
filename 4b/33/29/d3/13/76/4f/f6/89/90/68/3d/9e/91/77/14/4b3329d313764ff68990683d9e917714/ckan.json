    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "ITN Energy Systems, Inc., along with the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), proposes to develop a highly efficient power generation system capable of converting habitat crew waste from NASA space habitats into electricity and heat. The system will consist of ITN's novel, low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology, integrated with a revolutionary, highly efficient gasifier developed by EERC.  The waste to energy converter will be specifically designed and engineered to efficiently convert onsite habitat crew waste into electricity and heat. The tight thermal integration of an SOFC to the gasifier will enable the operation of a sub-stoichiometric air gasifier at an elevated temperature (1000&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C). At this temperature, the high levels of moisture inherent to habitat crew waste will function as an essential carbon gasifying medium, reducing the equivalence ratio at which the gasifier can operate with complete carbon conversion. By utilizing the moisture content of the food waste and the high temperature heat from the SOFC, the gasifier will operate with the addition of little or no air, generating producer gas that has not been heavily diluted with nitrogen.  This high quality producer gas is an optimal fuel for a solid oxide fuel cell.",
