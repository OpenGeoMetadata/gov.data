    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a miniature, MEMS IMU based, accurate isolation and stabilization system for beam pointing of a laser designator. Inertial stabilization and relative attitude control are the two key elements constituting the proposed accurate pointing control. Inertial stabilization allows isolation from interference and vibration. Relative attitude control is used for target tracking and to compensate pointing drift caused by gyro drift and the Earth's rotation. In Phase I of this project, first, using the simulation tools and experimental systems of AGNC, modeling and implementation evaluation of the proposed MEMS-based inertial pointing system are performed. Through the modeling and simulation of the closed loop system, the implementation method and the specification of the MEMS devices and pointing system will be further investigated. Then, an inertial motion measurement device test and tuning are performed. MEMS gyros for pointing stabilization are integrated into the platform structure. Next, system integration of the MEMS stabilization platform is investigated. An accuracy evaluation of the pointing stabilization system is performed. Finally, the mechanical structure of the stabilization platform and the integration of the MEMS with the system's mechanical and electronic components is proposed and investigated.",
