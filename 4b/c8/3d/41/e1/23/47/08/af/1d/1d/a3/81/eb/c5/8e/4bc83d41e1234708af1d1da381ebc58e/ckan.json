    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The goal of any spacecraft trajectory design process is to identify a path that transfers a vehicle from its point of origin to some specific destination in the presence of path and mission level constraints. From the mission designer perspective, this process is divided into two primary tasks: (a) the identification of candidate startup arcs, and (b) the subsequent refinement of those solutions, via targeting or optimization processes, to meet some pre-defined mission requirements. The work proposed here seeks to address the first aspect directly, while addressing the second indirectly, using NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) as the underlying demonstration platform. Phase I of this effort is focused on developing a prototype for an Interactive Visual Analytics Tool (IVAT) for GMAT. The goal of the IVAT module is to provide a modern, interactive, preliminary design tool that allows analysts to more efficiently explore and mine the space of candidate solutions prior to selecting a specific mission for the refinement phase. The development leverages GMAT's Advanced Path Planning (APP) and Dynamical Systems Analysis Toolbox (DSAT), developed by DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC). IVAT is envisioned as a preliminary design tool that can be readily integrated with gradient based optimal or sub-optimal refinement tools, such as but not limited to those provided by GMAT. However, for this effort we focus on GMAT as our selected technology demonstration platform.",
