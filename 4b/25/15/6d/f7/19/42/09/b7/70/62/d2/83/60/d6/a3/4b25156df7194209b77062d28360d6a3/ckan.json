  "notes": " The U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES) is playing a major role in development of technologies for cleanup of toxic and hazardous waste in military and civilian sites. Basic and applied research efforts are coordinated through our Hazardous Waste Research Center (HWRC) that opened in fiscal year 1988. The HWRC provides research and development and innovative technology demonstration support to all Corps of Engineers Districts and Divisions, the ten Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund program and the Assessment and Remediation of Contaminated Sediments program under the Clean Water Act. The HWRC conducts research at all levels, from initial laboratory investigations to the development and application of new and innovative technologies on site. Research is performed on a cost reimbursement basis and is executed through a variety of Federal funding arrangements, including work with the private sector under cooperative research and development agreements (CRDAs) to expedite transfer of remediation technologies to the governmental and private sector.   The Hazardous Waste Research Center, HWRC, located in Vicksburg, MS is part of the larger Corps of Engineers research complex, WES. It is nationally recognized by EPA&amp;#39;s Technology Innovation Office as a premier facility for this type of research. The HWRC offers a full service research and evaluation facility complete with safety equipment, a high-bay pilot studies area, and currently under construction large-scale pilot studies facility. The HWRC is permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and State of Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, DEQ, perform research investigations and treatment of most listed and characteristic hazardous wastes onsite.
