  "notes": "Eight species of insects adapted to exploit six host species of exotic plants were released on Service lands (Figure 1) managed by the NBR in 1991, 1992, and 1993 (Table 1). Long-term success of the releases cannot be predicted. Releases of at least one species resulted in successfully over-wintering populations, but reductions in the host plants are not yet obvious. C. lunula is known to have over-wintered successfully after release, but its host plant, Dalmatian toadflax, was more abundant on the monitored sites after release than before. In 1993 C; lunula was found on a small (two square feet) patch of Dalmatian toadflax at the Johnson Waterfowl Production Area, at least six miles from the closest release site. Apparently this insect is able to find very isolated plants at great distances from the original release site, enabling C. lunula to persist and affect an impact on Dalmatian toadflax. Releases of A. plagiata, U. cardiu, and G. calmariensis have resulted in successful establishment, and their host plants were damaged and/or reduced in abundance after their release. Acreage and density of St. Johnswort infestations on the NBR were much reduced in 1992 (Table 2). No releases of St. Johnswort biocontrol agents were made in 1991 or 1992, so the reduction was apparently due to cyclic increases of Chyrsolina hypericum and Chyrsolina quadrigemina, previously established in 1948, and to Agrillus hyperici released in the 1950's and only recently re-observed on the NBR. St. Johnswort populations have been monitored from 1985-1993, excepting 1987. These monitoring results indicate cyclical control. Photo points established in 1989 are to be revisited in 1995. We do not know that the observed damage to exotic plants was due entirely to the action of the introduced biocontrol agents, rather than abiotic factors. However, the observed association of damage to individual plants with insects established on those individual plants leads us to believe that some biocontrol agents are successfully controlling the spread of their hosts.",
