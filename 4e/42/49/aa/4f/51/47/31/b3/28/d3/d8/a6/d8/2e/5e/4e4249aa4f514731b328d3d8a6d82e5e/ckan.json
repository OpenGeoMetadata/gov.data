  "notes": "The Soil Atlas project provides a consistent, statewide map series and GIS data set describing soil and landscape characteristics. The data is generalized. The scale of 1:250,000, or about 1/4 inch to 1 mile, makes it possible to show areas as small as 1 square mile. The data set and maps were created in the 1970's to provide information to support generalized planning over broad areas. The maps were not intended to replace the detailed soil surveys, but to provide a more general overview, and to provide make soil description information available until such a time as soil surveys were completed statewide. The Soil Atlas map series was developed by the Department of Soil, Water, and Climate of the University of Minnesota, in cooperation with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (previously Soil Conservation Service), U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Minnesota Geological Survey. Two main descriptors of soils are groupings of Soil Landscape Units based on a number of factors (soil texture of the rooting zone, soil texture below the rooting zone, drainage, and color), and delineations of Geomorphic Regions, which illustrate broad physiographic features and provide some characterization of the parent materials of the soils. Further soils characterizations are derived from these primary categories. Printed maps were converted to EPPL raster GIS format via grid-cell coding by the Minnesota Land Management Information System at the University of Minnesota (now the Land Management Information Center).",
