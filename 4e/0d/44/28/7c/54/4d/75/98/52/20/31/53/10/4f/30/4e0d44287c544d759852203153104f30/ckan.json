  "notes": " \n        Social Impact was contracted by MCC to develop and conduct an evaluation of the Malawi Compact. Specifically, SI has been tasked to “assess the program design and implementation to develop the most rigorous evaluation design feasible, whether it is a performance or impact evaluation, and identify the most appropriate evaluation methodology feasible given the context.” \nEfforts to identify a research design that would allow for a rigorously defined counterfactual were unsuccessful, and as a result this design document outlines plans for a rigorous performance evaluation that will aim to measure key outcome indicators early on in the Compact, midway through, and at the end of the Compact, as well as track changes over time. This evaluation is designed to address the core questions of the evaluation (Table 1) Since the proposed design is a performance evaluation, it is important to note that it may not be possible to state with confidence how the power sector in Malawi has changed (or not changed) as a result of the Compact, as it will not be possible to control for other potential causes of change. In some cases, however, it may be feasible to identify and potentially rule out alternative explanations.\nThe inability to define a counterfactual requires a reformulation of some of the initial evaluation questions originally proposed by MCC, including some core questions included in the SI-MCC contract. In addition, the Evaluation Assessment Report revealed that both SI and MCC had substantial concerns with regard to the original research questions proposed in Social Impact's contract. This is natural given the way that interventions change over time, and that the proposed questions should be feasible to answer based on the data that can be collected as part of the evaluation. Based on SI's comprehensive desk review, information gathered during the scoping trip, and frequent communication with MCC and MCA-M, the SI evaluation team has developed research questions and research approaches for the PSRP and the IDP project components, as proposed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The original questions and the suggested modifications for each question are presented in the Appendix. \n\n\nResearch Questions\nThrough a rigorous performance evaluation, the evaluation design aims to answer the following core evaluation questions and several complementary research questions:\n\n1. What declines in poverty, increases in economic growth, reductions in the electricity related cost of doing business, increases in access to electricity, and increases in value added production are observed over the life of the Compact?\n2. What were the results of the interventions - intended and unintended, positive or negative?\n3. Are there differences in outcomes of interest by gender, age and income? Sex and income disaggregated information for businesses and households will be pursued to the extent possible.\n4. What are the lessons learned and are they applicable to other similar projects?\n5. What is the likelihood that the results of the Project will be sustained over time?\n6. At the household level, the evaluations shall focus on the following program/project/activities impacts on household and individuals: income; expenditures, consumption and access to energy; individual time devoted to leisure and productive activities. \n7. At the enterprise level, the evaluation shall focus on the potential impact of the program/project/activities on: business profitability and productivity; value added production and investment; employment and wage changes; energy consumption and sources of energy used; business losses. \n8. At the regulatory, institutional and policy level, the evaluation shall explore the potential impacts of the program/project/activities on: utility operating costs and losses; financial sustainability; private investment, particularly in generation; expansion of electricity access for customers, particularly the poor.\n\nTo answer these questions, the evaluation design will leverage diverse research methodologies with different timelines for data collection. The evaluation design can be broken into three main parts, albeit with some overlap: \n\n· IDP evaluation: The IDP design focuses primarily on an intensive metering effort to measure the technical benefits of the project, including changes in energy delivered, outages, and quality. This will be complemented by focus groups with residents of beneficiary communities. \n· PSRP evaluation: The PSRP design incorporates five data collection activities, including: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, such as billing and procurement, (3) a series of largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a proposed survey of Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) employees, and (5) the PSRP process evaluation, focused on implementation and achievement of implementation milestones and outputs will be folded into the PSRP data collection activities. \n· Enterprise survey: A panel survey of businesses will be used to evaluate both the PSRP and the IDP. \n\nIDP Evaluation Design\nDesign Overview\nWe propose that the IDP evaluation consist of two major parts: (1) intensive metering to determine technical benefits, and (2) focus group discussions with beneficiaries. In addition, some of the activities conducted as part of the PSRP evaluation - specifically work flow analyses of response to outages - will also address IDP benefits made possible by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. \n\nPSRP\nSocial Impact proposes five data collection activities for the PSRP evaluation: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and MERA key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, (3) largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a survey of current ESCOM employees, and (5) process evaluation. These activities will occur in three phases: at baseline (to be conducted as soon as possible), at midline, and at the end of the Compact. The evaluation will seek to identify changes over time and then consider the extent to which any observed improvements can be attributed to Compact activities.\n      ",
