  "notes": "In March of 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted geophysical surveys east of Cat Island, Mississippi. The efforts were part of the USGS Gulf of Mexico Science Coordination partnership with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to assist the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP) and the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) Ecosystem Change and Hazards Susceptibility Project by mapping the shallow geological stratigraphic framework of the Mississippi Barrier Island Complex. The data collected will be used to create baseline bathymetry information that will address seafloor change. This report contains swath bathymetry and side scan sonar data collected aboard the R/V Survey Cat during Cruise 10CCT01. A combination of software packages was used to process and grid the data. This data series describes the methodology used and the resulting data projects.",
