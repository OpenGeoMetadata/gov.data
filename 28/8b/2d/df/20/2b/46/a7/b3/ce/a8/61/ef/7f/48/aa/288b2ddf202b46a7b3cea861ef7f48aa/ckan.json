    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The GOZCARDS Merged Data for Ozone Monthly Zonal Averages on a Geodetic Latitude and Pressure Grid product (GozMmlpO3) contains zonal means and related information (standard deviation, minimum/maximum value, etc.), calculated as a result of a merging process that ties together the source datasets, after bias removal and averaging. The merged O3 data are from the following satellite instruments: SAGE I (v5.9_rev; 1979-1981), SAGE II (v6.2; 1984-2005), HALOE (v19; 1991-2005), UARS MLS (v5; 1991-1997), ACE-FTS (v2.2; 2004-onward), Aura MLS (v2.2; 2004 onward) + others as validation (e.g., SAGE III, v4.0; 2002-2005). The vertical pressure range for O3 is from 147 to 0.5 hPa. The input source data used to create this merged product are contained in a separate data product with the short name GozSmlpO3.\n\nThe GozMmlpO3 merged data are written using the new netCDF4 enhanced model using CF-1 metadata attributes. The data variables are organized into a Group hierarchy structure. Global Attributes describing the data file (e.g. data start/end time, spatial extent, etc.) are located at the file/root level. Users can use netCDF enabled tools to view the data. Since netCDF4 is based on the HDF5 format, HDF5 readers will also work with these data files.\n\nParameters contained in the data files include the following:\nVariable Name    |Description                                  |Units\n/Merged/average  |Ozone Merged Zonal Average                   |(mol/mol)\nEnd of parameter informationGOZCARDS (Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere) refers to a commonly-formatted Earth system data record (ESDR) for stratospheric composition, of high relevance to the issue of ozone decline and recovery. High-quality long-term ozone and related trace gas data records are needed to (a) evaluate and understand composition changes in the atmosphere and (b) constrain model representations of atmospheric dynamics and photochemistry.",
