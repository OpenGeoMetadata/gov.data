    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed research focuses on the development of a new adaptive\ncontrol methodology for active control of wing aerodynamic shape to\neffect distributed aerodynamic forces and moments for maneuvering and\nstabilization of flexible airframes without moving control surfaces.\nThe new aero-effected flight control will be achieved using output\nfeedback adaptive control of distributed bleed across aerodynamic\nsurfaces, and is particularly suited for high-altitude long endurance\nvehicles.  The large-area air bleed is driven by the inherent pressure\ndifferences in flight across the pressure and suction wing surface, and\nis regulated by low-power, surface-integrated louver valves.  Our\nprevious basic research in adaptive control has stressed the ability to\nmodel and cancel the effect of uncertainty in output regulation.  We\nalso have developed methods for adaptation in the presence of nonlinear\nactuation, which includes such effects as actuator saturation.  These\ntools are currently being employed in the study of active flow control\nusing synthetic jet actuation, and will be adapted to the problems that\nare unique to improving aeroelastic performance and active damping of\nairframe-propulsion-structure interactions using distributed bleed.\nPhase I will focus on advancing the state of the art in output feedback\nadaptive control, and demonstration of the capability of aero-bleed to\ncontrol the dynamic modes of a flexible lifting surface.  These efforts\nwill be integrated in Phase-II by using an adaptive controller to\nregulate a flexible wing flown in three degrees of freedom in a wind\ntunnel experiment, using an existing traverse mechanism.  Another option\nis to use Atair Aerospace's LEAPP vehicle to flight test a highly\nflexible wing design.  Additional Phase-II and Phase-III transition\npossibilities include coordinated research efforts with Boeing related\nto the DARPA Vulture vehicle, and/or with AeroVironment related to the\nGlobal Observer vehicle.",
