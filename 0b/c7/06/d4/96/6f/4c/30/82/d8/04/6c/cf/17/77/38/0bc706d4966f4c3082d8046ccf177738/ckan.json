    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

The Seasat data were collected for a continuous\n90 days in 1978, at latitudes between 72 degrees South and 72 degrees\nNorth. GEOSAT was launched in 1985 and placed in a nearly identical\norbit to Seasat, also at latitudes of between 72 degrees South and 72\ndegrees North. The orbit was designed to provide high-density\nmeasurements over the Earth's surface, at a maximum grid spacing of 2.7 kilometers at the equator and much denser spacing over polar ice\nsheets. Data were acquired between April 1985 and September 1986.\n\nInitially acquired by the Johns Hopkins APL (Applied Physics Lab)\nsatellite tracking facility, the raw altimetry satellite data from\nSeasat and GEOSAT were passed on to NASA, via the US Navy. NASA\ndeveloped slope correction routines for the higher slopes over the ice\nsheets, relative to ocean surfaces. The data are height profile Level\n3 data and gridded height Level 4 data provided by the Oceans and Ice\nbranch of the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Physics of Goddard Space\nFlight Center. Elevations from the full data rate (i.e., one\nmeasurement every 662.5 m) are provided in georeferenced databases.\nThese elevations are relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. Gridded\nelevations at 10-kilometer and 20-kilometer spacing are provided in\nthe gridded data sets created from the GEOSAT and Seasat data,\nrespectively. Software to extract and browse subsets of these data is\nincluded. The IAS software also allows the user to view\ncontours created from the gridded data and groundtracks of the\nfull-rate data.\n",
