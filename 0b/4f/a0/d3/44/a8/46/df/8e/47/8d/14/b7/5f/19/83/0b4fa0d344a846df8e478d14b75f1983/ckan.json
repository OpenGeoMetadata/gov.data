    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose the concept of a tube map display as a means to effectively integrate schedule timeline information and fault diagnosis data into a single high value presentation. Tube maps are potentially a high value method of presenting multiple dimensions of information. This work will prove the feasibility of depicting combined schedule and fault information in the domain of asset scheduling using  a communications simulation testbed. This testbed will be based upon key node and link abstractions of the space, ground and deep space networks. In order to simulate how mission schedules are affected by faults, a range of communication path faults can be selected by a user and injected into mission scenarios in order to gain further insights into how schedules can be tuned in real time to changing conditions on ground and space assets. Injected faults are modeled as a set of additional scheduling constraints in exactly the same way as other physical or mission preference constraints. The uniform constraint representation used capture mission requirements, preferences, constraints and faults can also be extended to multi-criteria optimization objectives for the resource scheduler ? enabling a mix of factors to drive the generation of the optimized schedule.",
