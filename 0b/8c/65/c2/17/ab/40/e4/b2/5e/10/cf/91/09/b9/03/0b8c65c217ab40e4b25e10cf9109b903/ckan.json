  "notes": "During the 2003 breeding season, a point count survey project was conducted in Pool 21 of the Upper Mississippi River, Adams County, Illinois. The study area was the Long Island Complex (river miles 332.5 to 340.5). This study area included approximately 4,084 acres which was primarily comprised of mature floodplain bottomland forest, except for approximately 681 acres which were active agricultural fields until the early to mid-1990’s, after which agriculture was abandoned. Since then, this acreage has been undergoing ecological succession and is now comprised of old field and early successional floodplain forest. Additionally, this study area included several associated sloughs, wetlands, and backwaters. During this project, we established 48 point count locations along six transects. One transect (12 survey points) was located in the old field/early successional forest habitat. The remaining five transects (36 survey points) were established within the mature floodplain forest habitat. Each point was sampled two times during the breeding season (early June through early July). Ten-minute unlimited radius point counts were conducted, resulting in 96 sampled points. Additionally, “species of interest” identified between points (i.e. interpoint data) were also recorded. A cumulative total of 87 species were identified during this project. Of these, 82 species were recorded at one or more points, while 56 species were encountered at interpoints. The 87 species consisted of 17 Permanent Residents, 31 North American Migrants, and 39 Neotropical Migrants. Overall, 5,169 individual birds were identified at points, with an additional 477 tallied at interpoints. Among data from the point locations, the 10 most abundant species included: Common Grackle, Northern Cardinal, Indigo Bunting, Great Crested Flycatcher, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Eastern Wood-Pewee, American Robin, Black-capped Chickadee, American Crow, and Red-winged Blackbird. These species also had the highest relative densities. The 10 most frequently encountered species were similar, except the Brownheaded Cowbird and Red-eyed Vireo replaced the American Robin and Red-winged Blackbird, respectively. The 11 most widely distributed species included: Indigo Bunting, Northern Cardinal, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Great Crested Flycatcher, Common Grackle, Black-capped Chickadee, Red-headed Woodpecker, American Crow, Chimney Swift, Eastern Wood-Pewee, and Brown-headed Cowbird. This project provides preliminary baseline data regarding breeding season avian use of the mature and early successional forest habitats which are found within the Long Island Complex study area.",
