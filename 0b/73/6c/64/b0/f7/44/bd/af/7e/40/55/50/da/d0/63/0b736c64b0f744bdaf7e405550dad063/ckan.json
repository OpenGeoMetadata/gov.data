    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This SBIR Phase I proposes to investigate the use of proprietary coating materials to enhance the sensitivity, efficiency, and lifetime of microchannel plate (MCP) detectors. These detectors would be the basis for novel active layer multi dynode detectors for Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry as well as detectors of energetic photons. Previous work has led to the discovery that these materials have excellent potential for use as enhanced secondary electron emission yield (SEEY) coatings.  We have observed up to a factor of three increase in SEEY from these coatings when compared to commercial detectors. High SEEYs are particularly crucial to the detection of high mass molecules: The low detection efficiency for large biomolecular ions is a major limitation of commercial MCP detectors. Furthermore, the materials under development have high thermal conductivity and sputtering resistance and are thus ideally suited for long life and high count rate detectors. Under this proposal, we intend to undertake a detailed investigation of the use of proprietary coating materials to improve on commercial MCPs. We will characterize the SEEY of these new detectors under the impact of mono-energetic ions, large biomolecules, and x-rays in order to test their potential use for high-mass MS energetic photon applications.",
