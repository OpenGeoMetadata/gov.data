    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Electromagnetic Plasmoid Thruster (EMPT) program demonstrated a next generation propulsion system based on the purely electromagnetic generation and Lorentz acceleration of a magnetically self-confined plasmoid. The Peristaltic Dynamic Acceleration (PDA) stage is an addition to the exhaust of the EMPT that takes an existing, translating plasmoid and adds directed, kinetic energy with a set of sequenced magnetic field coils. The EMPT creates a high-density, magnetized plasmoid known as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) using external RF antennas that produce a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) throughout the thruster. The large FRC plasma currents together with the radial magnetic field result in a large JxB force that rapidly accelerates the FRC propellant out of the thruster. The Dynamic Acceleration stage then initiates a pulsed magnetic field behind the FRC increasing the magnetic field pressure gradient. These pulsed field coils can very efficiently add kinetic energy to a magnetized, closed-field plasmoid and be used to increase velocity and average thruster power from 1 kW to greater than 20 kW, all without any changes to the original thruster.\r\n\r\nThe EMPT will be operated at maximum ionization efficiency at 2 kHz. The PDA will then accelerate the high-mass plasmoid to the required mission velocities. In this way power can be added to the device incrementally depending on the mission and power available. This also enables a so-called dual mode thruster that can operate over a wide range of power, thrust, and specific impulse while still maintaining constant gas flow for very long life, deep space missions. The PDA allows for the incremental development and qualification of the thruster, dramatically reducing total costs. Finally, the ability to rapidly and cheaply increase the power of a space-qualified thruster by factors of ten allow for the propulsion technology to grow with the available power for NASA science missions.\r\n",
