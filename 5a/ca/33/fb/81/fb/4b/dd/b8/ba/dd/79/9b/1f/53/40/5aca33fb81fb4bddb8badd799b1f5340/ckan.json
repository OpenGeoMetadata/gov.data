    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Busek is developing a high throughput nominal 100-W Hall Effect Thruster.  This device is well sized for spacecraft ranging in size from several tens of kilograms to several hundred kilograms.  It could be fueled by either xenon or iodine.  The latter yields performance like xenon, but stores at low pressure and high density, make it especially attractive for volume limited spacecraft.  The available specific impulse will be 1400-1600-s. The target thruster efficiency is 45&#37;.  At 100-W and 1500-s, the thrust will be 6.1 mN.  The lifetime of the thruster may exceed 10,000 hours, yielding a throughput of greater than 14.9 kg.\r\n \r\nIn Phase I, the thruster was designed. Design considerations included efficiency, specific impulse, temperature, lifetime, mass, volume, and cost.  Careful attention to the magnetic field resulted in a \"magnetically shielded\" shape, which should minimize or entirely eliminate ion wall losses.  Testing with a nominal 200-W thruster showed the feasibility and desirability of both permanent magnets and a diamond discharge channel.  Permanent magnets save mass, volume, and power.  Diamond reduces ion sputtering by 50&#37; with respect to conventional materials.\r\n\r\nIn Phase II, the 100-W thruster and a compact cathode to accompany it will be manufactured, tested, and improved.  Performance, lifetime, and plume properties will be evaluated.  Testing will include both xenon and iodine.  Year 2 development will focus on maximizing throughput.  Integrated testing will include a compact, low cost, power processing unit. The technology will reach TRL 5.\r\n\r\nThe program is responsive to NASA topic S3.03, Propulsion Systems. Both the \"Electric Propulsion\" and \"Micro-Propulsion\" sub-topics are relevant.  The proposal also addresses several of NASA's Grand Challenges, including Efficient In-Space Transportation, Space Debris Hazard Mitigation, and Economical Space Access.",
