  "notes": "Ruby Lake NWR 1992 Annual Water Management Report 1993 Annual Water Management Plan. Includes summary of 1992 weather, 1992 water levels, water availability forecast for 1993, and water management objectives for 1993. The combination of below average precipitation at the Refuge and below average percent water content of the Ruby Mountains snow pack since 1984 (8 years) has resulted in surface water elevations that have been below objective levels since 1987. Additionally, the lack of precipitation has caused a significant deficit in ground water and a subsequent decline in the basin water table. Because of the lack of water and in addition to the current decreased quantity of surface and ground water storage, lack of sufficient precipitation and snow pack will continue to have an extreme negative impact on Refuge wetlands. The present situation will only be reversed following consecutive years of above average precipitation. However, the water must first replenish groundwater and thus increase the water table. Only after this occurs will there be an increase in surface water acreage. The sum of the precipitation received on the Refuge during the past eight years is 85.93in. An estimate of the potential total average precipitation during the same period can be calculated by multiplying the annual average precipitation by eight which equals 103.84. Comparing these two figures shows that the amount of precipitation received during the last eight year is approximately 17.91in less than average. In other words, because of the drought, during the last eight years there is a lack of 1.4 years of precipitation. Assuming that the snow pack provides a minimum of 50 percent (it is likely a much higher percentage) of the water needed to maintain average water elevations of Refuge wetlands, at a minimum then, there is a lack of nearly three years worth of precipitation. Given the deficit of ground water and a reduced amount of wetland acreage, it is conceivable that three consecutive years of average to above average precipitation (primarily snow pack) is needed before average water elevations occur on the Refuge.",
