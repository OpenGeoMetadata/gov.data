    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Fibertek has developed transmitters for Lidar and 3D imaging\napplications based on fiber optics architectures both at 1064nm.  We\nhave demonstrated an all fiber transmitter producing as much as 15W at\n10Kpps.  This all-fiber based transmitter produces pulses at 1064nm as\nshort as 750ps and can have its repetition rate varied from 10Kpps to\nseveral 10s of Mpps.  In addition the transmitter central wavelength can\nbe tuned.  The space-qualifiable 1064nm transmitter we propose here for\nLong Range Communication is based on these development efforts.  We\npropose here to extend the operation of our architecture to 150ps pulses\nand demonstrate the front end during the Phase-I portion of this effort\noperating between 1Mpps and 60Mpps.  We will also work to maintain near\ntransform limited pulses and as high wall-plug efficiency as possible.\nAn Engineering-Unit, designed with space traceable electronic\ncomponents, will be delivered at the end of the Phase-II portion of this\nSBIR effort.",
