  "notes": "This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 30x30 meter cell size representing the backscatter intensity of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 1997. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory as well as the R/V Ewing , and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Charleston Bump to identify habitats for deep water coral ecosystems from 05/03/1997 to 05/05/1997. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Atlas Hydrosweep multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by the College of Charleston Department of Geology using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option \"BASE Surface to Image\" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Rugosity was derived from this surface using NOAA's Benthic Terrain Modeler extension.",
