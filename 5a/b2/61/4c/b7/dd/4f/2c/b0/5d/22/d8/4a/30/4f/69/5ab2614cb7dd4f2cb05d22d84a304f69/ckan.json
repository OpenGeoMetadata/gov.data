    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The proposed research program will develop a physics-based identification, modeling and risk management infrastructure for aeroelastic transonic flutter and limit-cycle oscillations (LCO). This capability will be built upon high fidelity state-of-the-art theoretical/computational methods as validated and verified by available experimental data bases, and will include (1) rapid flutter boundary determination for a wide range of configurations; (2) an assessment of the relative importance of various aerodynamic and structural nonlinearities for aircraft and aerospace configurations that are determined to be flutter critical and hence potentially capable of LCO; (3) an assessment of expected LCO amplitudes based upon high fidelity computational models; (4) an assessment of the potential for active and/or passive alleviation of LCO; and (5) a proposed risk management methodology that incorporates a prediction of tolerable LCO amplitudes and the capability for reducing unacceptable LCO response. Key challenges and milestones to by met include (1) a demonstration of the use of Navier-Stokes based CFD models and nonlinear structural models, including the use of system identification methods as appropriate and needed to predict flutter and LCO; (2) a demonstration of accurate modeling of aerodynamic and structural nonlinearities such as large shock wave motion, separated flow, structural freeplay and large geometric structural deflections and their impact on flutter and LCO; (3) characterization and evaluation of nonlinear dampers and nonlinear stiffness devices for alleviating LCO; (4) characterization and evaluation of active control systems for alleviating LCO; and (5) design and demonstration in wind tunnel test and flight test of an LCO alleviation device.",
