Sea floor character derived from towed sidescan sonar data is available for the mainland coast within the study area from USGS online publications (Cochrane and others, 2003; Cochrane and others, 2005). The number of substrate classes was reduced because rugosity could not be derived for all areas due to the lack of bathymetry data for other data sets used in the study.
