    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;FLEET uses a 100 fs laser to excite a multi-photon process that makes the gas (N2 or air) glow.&amp;nbsp; Images of the glowing gas taken at set time intervals allow the gas velocity to be measrued.&amp;nbsp; FLEET has the following advantageous features compared with existing measurement techniques: (1) it excites naturally-present N2 so it can be used in N2 or air flows - not requiring additional gas or particle seeding; (2) both excitation and detection are in the visible spectral range, so special UV or IR windows are not required; (3) only a single laser and camera is required which simplifies setup and operation; (4) the technique has been shown to work over a large range of pressures and is therefore amenable to a wide range of speed regimes (subsonic to hypersonic); and (5) the technique can easily be extended to measure thousands of samples per second.&amp;nbsp; The technique is thus applicable to a much wider range of wind tunnels than any other velocity measurement technique currently being developed at NASA.&amp;nbsp; For comparison, one currently state-of-the-art technique, NO2 molecular tagging velocimetry, requires three lasers, requires seeding the flow with toxic NO2 gas, requires expensive UV-grade fused silica windows on two sides of the wind tunnel and is limited to about 10 measurements per second.&lt;/p&gt;",
