  "notes": "Underwater Site 7P was established off Rose Atoll, American Samoa by Dr. James Maragos, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, on February 24, 2002. With a start point (meter 0) at latitude 14 32.967S longitude 168 10.086W, a series of metal stakes were pounded into the substrate to delineate a 50-meter line that could be relocated and reassessed on future surveys. The site was resurveyed on February 10, 2004. A fiberglass tape was unrolled along the line marked by the stakes and a series of photographs was taken of the benthos in consecutive 1-meter-square (1m x 1m) quadrats, using an Olympus 5050Z digital camera in an underwater housing. The overall goal was to acquire data from the photographs and analyze and present quantitative data in a manner to be useful for scientists and refuge management. Each image is labeled with a 3-letter location code (ROS), date (10Feb04), site number (7P), and meter interval along the transect line (e.g., 5-6M). The software program SigmaScan Pro 5.0 was used to analyze each image. Analysis was completed by a single observer, Alison Veit. For each photoquadrat, the anthozoan colonies (scleractinian genera Pocillopora, Montipora) were identified and the maximum diameter (cm) of each colony determined. The center of each colony had to fall within the photoquadrat frame in order to be counted for a photoquadrat. If the colony extended beyond one photoquadrat, one diameter was determined and counted in the photoquadrat in which the center of the colony was found. After all the anthozoan colonies in the photoquadrat had been measured, the data were binned into 7 size classes (1-5 cm, 6-10 cm, 11-20 cm, 21-40 cm, 41-80 cm, 81-160 cm, >160 cm). A visual estimate of coral percent cover in each photoquadrat was also recorded.",
