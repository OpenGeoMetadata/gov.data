  "notes": "Previously, amphibian malformations had only been studied at the site, state and regional  levels, limiting our understanding of the types of malformations most commonly occurring in  wild populations across the country. This study presents the results of radiographic analyses  performed on morphologically abnormal amphibians collected from National Wildlife  Refuges in 27 states and 6 of 7 US Fish and Wildlife Service regions. Despite considerable  differences in species composition and ecological factors (e.g., habitat type, climate and land  use), it was observed that abnormalities were remarkably similar across regions of the  country. One regional difference that was noted was that higher proportions of forelimb and  craniofacial abnormalities were observed in the western regions (Regions 1 and 7) compared  to the eastern ones. However, the uneven distribution of these abnormalities across sites,  suggest that these elevated proportions may not be characteristic of region 1. Differences in  species composition as well as in ecological factors such as habitat type and climate are  potential explanations for this pattern in Region 7. Given the known differences in regional  causes, the results of this study suggest that these stressors may be affecting amphibian  development in the same manner to produce primarily hind limb reductions. Continued  research comparing the types of abnormalities produced in different areas of the country as  well as what stressors are present is essential to identify cause and affect relationships at sites  hosting abnormal amphibians.",
