    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this NASA STTR program is to produce ultra-lightweight electrical wire and cable harnesses to reduce the liftoff weight of future space flight vehicles.  In cooperation with materials scientists at Texas A&amp;M, NanoSonic would develop and manufacture ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber- and carbon nanotube-based rubber (CNT Rubber) wire and cables with performance equivalent to that of conventional copper cables but with only 10&#37; the weight.  Wiring harnesses contribute significant weight load to the spacecraft structure.  Ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wires and cables can reduce that weight while offering comparable or superior electrical power and data transmission performance and EMI resistance.  During Phase I, NanoSonic would design, fabricate and test lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wire and cable prototypes.  Texas A&amp;M's nanotechnology laboratory would co-develop methods for CNT Rubber production and evaluate resulting material properties.  The conducting core and outer shielding layers would be fabricated by molecular-level self-assembly.  Electrically-conducting cable shielding tape layers would be dimensioned using CAD-driven templating equipment at NanoSonic.  Wire and cable would be manufactured using wire feed, dielectric extrusion and shielding tape winding steps.  NanoSonic is working with a major U.S. cable manufacturer and a major U.S. spacecraft prime contractor on this program.",
