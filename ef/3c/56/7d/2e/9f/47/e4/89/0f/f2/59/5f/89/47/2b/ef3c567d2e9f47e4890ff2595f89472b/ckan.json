  "notes": "In March, 1986 Mr. Dornbusch supplied us with an old sample of the herbicide that he thought was buried. He said he had taken some of the material home before the rest was buried. The sample of material given to us by Mr. Dornbusch was sent to Mississippi State University for analysis in late March, 1986. Analysis of the sample by high performance liquid chromatography indicated that the sample contained 18.75% 2,4,5-T and this identity was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The solubility characteristics of the sample in water indicated it was an ester form of 2,4,5-T. Numerous soil samples and some water samples were taken at various depths from the trenches excavated at site 1 in September 1987. Soil samples were collected with stainless steel spoons, cleaned in acetone between samples. The sample containers were cleaned 500 ml widemouth jars from the I-Chem Co. Samples were frozen upon return to the Reynoldsburg FWS office on September 22, 1987. Seven sediment samples were submitted to Mississippi State University on September 6, 1988 for chlorophenoxy acid herbicides analysis. Owing to delays caused mainly by Patuxent Analytical Control Facility (PACF), results of the analyses were not available until March 5, 1990, despite the promised 90-day turn-around period. Results of the GC/MS analyses were negative for all samples at a level of detection of 0.01 ppm.",
