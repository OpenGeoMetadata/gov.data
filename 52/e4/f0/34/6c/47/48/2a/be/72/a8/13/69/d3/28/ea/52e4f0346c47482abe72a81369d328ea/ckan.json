We collected data from the ground, towed behind a researcher on skis or snowmobile, and from the air, strapped underneath a helicopter. All of the profiles are linked to coincident GPS observations. Coincident in-situ data is provided for calibration, and may be composed of any of the following: snow pits and/or snow-pit/snow-core combinations, probe profiles, and ablation stakes. This supplemental information may be used to calibrate velocity for conversion from time domain to depth domain. This supplemental information is provided as is, with additional information specific to usage included within the in-situ folder.",
