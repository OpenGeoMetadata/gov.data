  "notes": " As part of the Electronics Prototyping and Manufacturing Mission, of the Electronics and Prototyping Branch, the Semi-Automated, Surface Mount Technology (SMT) Soldering System greatly enhances the reliability and repeatability of the SMT soldering process. The design and function of the system is ideal for small-batch and test-run manufacturing, rework, and component replacement. Being operator-controlled, the system allows for rapid set-up, adjustment, and modification, in addition to being easily maintained. The system is fully capable of utilizing either solder paste &amp;quot;tack&amp;quot; or adhesive methods of component-to-board retention prior to soldering. Dedicated, recirculating air filtration is utilized to negate the need for outside venting of the soldering process.  ",

A Pneumatically Driven Solder Paste Stencil Printer that ensures precise solder paste placement and quantity. A CPU controlled, Convection Reflow Oven that can be programmed to repeat the thermal soldering profile of standardized printed wiring boards. Utilizes conveyor to transport the assembly being soldered through the temperature controlled heating zones within the oven. A Thermal Profiler, with computer interface capability, that traverses the soldering stages within the Convection Reflow Oven and provides a continuous computer screen representation and recording capability of the temperatures of the heating zones within the oven. An Adhesive Curing Oven, with fan-forced air circulation, that is used to accelerate the curing of SMT adhesive. Multiple boards can be processed simultaneously to allow for the continuous operation of the reflow oven A Self-Contained Air Filtration System, connected directly to the ventilation output of the reflow oven. Utilizing operator replaceable filters, this unit meets applicable air quality requirements without ventilation to the outside environment, thereby eliminating the loss of the temperature and humidity-controlled environment within the facility.
