  "notes": "The purpose of this study was to address several issues relating to water and sediment quality within the Huleia National Wildlife Refuge which was prompted by recent residential and light industrial development upstream. The goals were to address any possible exposure risks to endangered birds, establish baseline information regarding chemical contamination within the Refuge, and help in directing appropriate management action and future planning. Sediment contamination within the Refuge and the streams feeding into it; implications for local endangered bird species. Basic water parameters measured in situ showed normal water conditions, except at site 8 where dissolved oxygen was lower than expected. - Of the 151 different chemicals analyzed for in sediments, only concentrations of arsenic, chromium, mercury, and nickel were considered significant with the potential to cause ecological harm at the majority of sample sites. Water samples were not available for analysis. The exposure risk was determined to be low for protected bird species whose primary diet is benthic invertebrates. No significant exposure pathway routes between contaminated sediments and these receptor species could be established based on the surveys and chemical analysis available for this report. However, data gaps did exist. There is potential exposure risk for birds whoâ€™s diet is predominantly aquatic plants. Arsenic, lead, and nickel can bioaccumulate in aquatic plants, but this risk was not verified since plant tissue concentrations were not measured. - Hawaiian soils and sediments often show higher baseline trace metal concentrations than that found in the conterminous US which must be considered when making toxicological decisions. Sources for some of the uniformly high but suspect sediment metal levels were not clear and may be a result of naturally elevated local baseline levels or unknown anthropogenic inputs. Recent upstream land development and its effects on sediment and water quality within the Refuge and streams feeding into it. There is possible evidence for a minor input of anthropogenic metals from the development into Puhi and Papakolea Streams. This input is minimal and does not quantitatively add to local toxicity. A quantitative baseline for 151 contaminants in sediments has been established for assessing future potential impacts of the development and other insults. Future management of the refuge as freshwater taro wetlands or saline mudflats. Contaminant content in runoff from the recent development was minimal and did not alter water quality within the Refuge. Management of the Refuge should not be altered based on this concern. There was insufficient information to assess the water quality of the tidally influenced Nawiliwili Stream which may be the potential saline water source for the Refuge if it is converted to saline mudflat habitat. Periodic monitoring of water and sediment quality should continue in order to asses impacts from future development with the additional goal of assessing water quality during rain events when high runoff would be expected from the developed areas. A study should be conducted to assess the metal concentrations in the food sources of the endangered birds with specific focus on aquatic plants and algae.",
