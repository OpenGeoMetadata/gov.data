  "notes": "Oilfield activities on the North Slope of Alaska result in production of large amounts of wastes and fugitive dust. Surface storage and disposal of these wastes may adversely affect the receiving environment. In this study, toxicity, using Photobacterium phosphoreum in the Microtox. Toxicity test and water quality of reserve pits, natural waterbodies, impoundments, and oily waste pits were compared within the Prudhoe Bay and adjacent oilfields. Toxicities in natural waterbody surface microlayer and subsurface water were also compared. Reserve pits and natural waterbodies showed no significant difference in pH, but reserve pits were significantly higher in conductivity (P<.0001), total hardness (P< .0001), and total alkalinity (P< .0001). No toxicity was observed in natural waterbody samples, either in surface grabs, surface microlayer samples, or subsurface samples (n = 18). Toxicity was observed in fluids from 9 of 24 reserve pits. The most toxic reserve pit fluids had an EC50 of 3%. Samples from the two solid oily waste pits examined were extremely toxic (EC50's = 3% and <22%). No significant correlations were observed between toxicity and pH, conductivity, total hardness, and total alkalinity in multiple regression analysis, suggesting that toxicity should be measured directly rather than by these water quality indicators. Surface microlayer monitoring was not shown to be a useful monitoring tool for airborne contaminants in North Slope oilfields at this time, but should be further evaluated. The Microtox Photobacterium phosphoreum bioassay was a useful tool for measuring the toxicity of oilfield fluids.",
