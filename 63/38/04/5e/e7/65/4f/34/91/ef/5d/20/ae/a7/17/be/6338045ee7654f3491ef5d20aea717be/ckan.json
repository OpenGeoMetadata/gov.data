  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides an environment for developing and evaluating intelligent software for both actual and simulated autonomous vehicles. Laboratory computers provide a simulated environment for testing intelligent algorithms for land, air, and sea vehicles. The laboratory&amp;#39;s several types of indoor and outdoor robot platforms serve as a testbed for robotics applications. The mobile robots are also available as test platforms for sensors, interfaces, and other technologies being developed by groups within NRL. DESCRIPTION: The robot laboratory is a 1338 sq ft facilitythat allows space for indoor operation of mobile robots and can be configured with obstacles or furniture to simulate expected working environments. A large research support vehicle adds the ability to transport mobile robots to offsite or outdoor worksites, provides its own power, and includes computer workstations for work in the field. The facility maintains 20 mobile robots widely used in the robotics community, enabling the integration of outside research from other government, academic, and industry laboratories. The robots include models from Nomadic Technologies, iRobot, Segway, and ActivMedia. Researchers can assemble homogeneous or heterogeneous robotic teams for use in indoor or outdoor environments. Poprioceptive sensors on the robots include odometry, a pitch/roll/yaw sensor, compass, GPS, inertial position tracker, and tactile bumpers. Onboard rangefinders include sonar, active infrared, scanning laser lidar, structured light, and stereovision cameras. In addition to the robots&amp;#39; onboard computers, the lab employs Sun workstations, Linux PCs, Windows PCs, and Macs. INSTRUMENTATION: In addition to the robots&amp;#39; autonomous capabilities, communication with stationary host computers is available via a wireless data network and a wireless video system, permitting distributed computing and feedback to remote users. Sensor data and robot performance can be logged onboard or offboard, tailored to the project as arranged by the principal investigator.  ",
