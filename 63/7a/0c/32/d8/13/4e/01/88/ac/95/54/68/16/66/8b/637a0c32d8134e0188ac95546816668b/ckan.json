    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The mission of the CFS project is to provide reusable software in support of human space exploration programs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The top-level technical approach to individual deliveries in this project is two phased &amp;ndash; first prototype, then productize.&amp;nbsp; It is intended that every product will need some informal prototyping prior to delivery to evaluate whether the CFS architecture layers properly over different topologies or for a different application.&amp;nbsp; Once deemed viable and a working prototype can be demonstrated, a CFS release can be moved into production.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is intended that there may be several of these phases working simultaneously in parallel for different products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prototypes will be performed on the target platform, topology, or environment in which it will be used. Once demonstrated, the prototype will become productized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The productization approach will vary based upon intended use and criticality of the product being produced, and follow NPR 7150.2A accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An assessment of the product will be performed and an appropriate software classification and safety criticality will be identified.&amp;nbsp; For products intended for public use, but not necessarily used in safety-critical applications, a less formal process will be required.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For human-rating applications, productization will be accomplished by first assessing existing artifacts from the Goddard Class B software, then by producing delta&amp;rsquo;s necessary to facilitate future Class A human-rated certification.&amp;nbsp; Software products intended for human spaceflight will be developed in accordance with NPR 7150.2B and adhering to CMMI level 3 processes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A software development plan and associated requirements, design and test documents will be written for each product, or suite of products.&amp;nbsp; The software development plan will identify the artifacts to be produced for that product, the level of testing for the product, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;",
