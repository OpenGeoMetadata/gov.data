  "notes": "  The Decade Radiation Test Facility (DRTF), at the U.S. Air Force&amp;#39;s Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee is a new advanced-generation radiation test facility designed to test 21st century space and missile systems and their components.  The DRTF is a world-class, unique facility producing multiple radiation environments to test various systems such as satellites and missile guidance controls and their components. A smaller X-ray simulator, the Modular Bremsstrahlung Source (MBS) provides nuclear weapons effects (NWE) testing on cables and small satellite components. It is the only DoD nuclear weapons effects facility with the capability to sufficiently test systems to their high confidence requirements and show they will survive and properly function in radiation environments experienced during their missions.  The facility features 1,000 square feet of floor space for user acquisition needs, a very low noise floor, dedicated storage capabilities and a state-of-the-art radiation safety system. The facility can be configured to accommodate testing at various security levels including Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  A smaller X-ray simulator, the Modular Bremsstrahlung Source (MBS) operates in a lower energy range. The MBS simulator is used for System Generated Electro-Magnetic Pulse (SGEMP), Internal Electro-Magnetic Pulse ( IEMP) and does enhancement effects testing. It can produce approximately 10 shots per hour and a vacuum chamber is available.   ",
