    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;In considering targets for&amp;nbsp;human asteroid missions, there are several major factors that will make a significant difference in assessment of mission risks that can be addressed by simple photo-reconnaissance of a target. One of the most important of these factors is the spin state of the asteroid: does it rotate in a slow, easily predictable way? Asteroids that rotate very rapidly or that tumble about multiple axes present significant hazards in planning and executing proximity operations&amp;minus; especially operations that must be carried out over extended time periods.&amp;nbsp; Another consideration is the physical state of the asteroid itself: is it a coherent mass or does it consist of a gravitationally bound pile of much smaller pieces? A coherent structure is unlikely to rearrange its configuration in response to a push by an astronaut or a hardware deployment and will provide a much easier surface in which to plant anchors for astronaut mobility or to hold equipment to the surface than will a rubble pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full success criteria entails flying by a near Earth asteroid and acquire images sufficient to determine the target volume, shape model, Asteroid spectral type and meteorite analogs, rotational properties (pole position, rotation period), orbit, debris/dust field in local environment, and regolith characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting this requirement&amp;nbsp;addresses the need to fill Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG&amp;rsquo;s) related to asteroids as a precursor to subsequent safe and successful human missions.&amp;nbsp; The data obtained will also support the advancement of science interests in asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;",
