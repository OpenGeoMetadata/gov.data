  "notes": "This report summarizes a study with the following results: 1. Three of the metals reported as carcinogens, arsenic, chromium, and nickel, were found within the range of values that would be expected to occur normally in the environment. Cadmium was somewhat above background levels at two sites, Mallett's and Coker's. In fact, the highest levels for most metals were found in soil samples taken at Mallett's Land Farm. This is suspected to have been the result of the historic application of sewage sludge to the site. The elevated level at Coker's is probably associated with the previous oil reclaiming operation. There is no indication that metals are responsible for the incidence of tumors on the refuge. 2. Organochlorines and PCBs were reported at or below the level of detection in all samples and, as such, should not be a causative agent in the occurrence of tumors. 3. With the exception of the Coker's Field site, PAHs were found at low concentrations and should be of no concern. On the other hand, PAHs at Coker's are at levels that have been documented to cause tumors in fish. Analysis of grasshoppers, a priority food source for the cranes, taken from the same area did not have elevated concentrations indicating that PAHs are not biomagnifying through that segment of the food chain. 4. The Fifth Annual Report on Carcinogens, 1989, the most recent edition published by the Public Health Service, now lists a total of 162 agents. Obviously, since the refuge study only addressed 12 of these chemicals, the occurrence of the vast majority of known or suspected carcinogens on the refuge remains unknown.",
