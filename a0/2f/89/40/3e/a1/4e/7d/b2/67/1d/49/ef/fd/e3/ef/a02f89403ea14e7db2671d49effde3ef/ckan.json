    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop innovative device concepts and\nfabrication techniques that enable the construction of high-performance\nuncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-12?Ym) photodetectors. LWIR\nphotodetectors are of great importance in real-time acquisition of\nradiation characteristics of the Earth and its environments for\nunderstanding and predicting the Earth's climate and potential hazards.\nQuantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) technology offers an excellent\nchoice for LWIR sensing due to its superior performance, including high\ntemporal resolution (&amp;lt;1 ?Ys) and low noise equivalent temperature\ndifference (NETD &amp;lt;10mK). However, existing QDIP technology requires\ncryogenic cooling to reduce dark current, which substantially increases\nsize, weight and power consumption. Because of this, the proposed\nresearch aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabrication\ntechniques that can substantially reduce dark current, thus allow the\nconstruction of uncooled QDIPs. The uncooled QDIP technology enables\nhigh-performance LWIR detecting on a chip with significantly reduced\npayload. It is highly desired in many Earth science applications. The\nPhase I work will perform feasibility investigation of the proposed\ndevice concept, optimize quantum dots growth and annealing techniques\nand produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can be\nbuilt and demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied platform.",
