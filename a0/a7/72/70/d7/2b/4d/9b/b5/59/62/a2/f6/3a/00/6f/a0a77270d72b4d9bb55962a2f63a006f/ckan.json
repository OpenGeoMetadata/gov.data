    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is a great need for better understanding of the continuity of atmospheric processes on multiple scales ranging from several kilometers to the order of a meter. Although the general features of this process are well-established, they are poorly quantified. This lack of understanding leads to significant uncertainties in the parameterizations used in numerical models of weather prediction, pollution transport and diffusion, etc. Improvement of the models is heavily dependent upon available data, increasing the need for improved remote satellite and terrestrial based measurements as well as affordable, capable, and easily operated in situ measurement systems. The complementary nature of these two measurement techniques ensure that recent work toward the revolutionary use of unmanned aircraft systems for in situ measurements has the potential to greatly enhance data gathered through remote sensing and significantly affect the study of the atmospheric boundary layer. \r\n\r\nBlack Swift Technologies proposes the creation, testing, and validation of a new in situ atmospheric sensing instrument, the Coordinated Atmospheric Profiling System (CAPS).  This will be realized as a coordinated multi-aircraft system with each unmanned aircraft consisting of tightly integrated airframe, avionics and sensors specifically designed to measure atmospheric parameters (i.e., temperature, pressure, humidity, and 3D winds).  Each aircraft will be cost-effective, simple, rugged, and easy to operate while performing atmospheric experiments with the required level of accuracy for scientific missions.  Furthermore, the system will be designed with the intention of extending multi-aircraft functionality to other Earth observing missions through the use of a removable nose cone with well documented power and data interfaces. This further enables simple connection to the autopilot and on-board computer to enable intelligently optimized data gathering and coordination.",
