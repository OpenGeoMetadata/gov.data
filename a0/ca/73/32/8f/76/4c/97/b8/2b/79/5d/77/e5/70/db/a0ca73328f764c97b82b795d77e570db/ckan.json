    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA has determined that the use of modular and reconfigurable components is critical for the success of future large and complex space systems.   In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be able to assemble and reassemble modules both on the ground and on orbit.  Therefore, it requires a means to join components that is simple, reliable, and non-intrusive as well as strong and stiff enough to withstand multiple connections and disconnections.  AeroAstro?s solution is to apply a new micro-scale mechanical joining technology, Vaccro, to the modular space systems.  Created by VACCO Industries, Vaccro is analogous to ?metal Velcro? in that two surfaces will mechanically adhere to each other upon contact.  Depending on the type of Vaccro used, these bonds can be either permanent or reversible.  With this technology, the surfaces of space system components and modules would be micro-machined with Vaccro features during the ground fabrication process.  With slightly different channel geometries, the surfaces can be peeled apart and rejoined, or they can be made such that the surfaces lock together permanently.  AeroAstro along with VACCO Industries, proposes to determine the specifications for and material qualities of a space suitable Vaccro product.",
