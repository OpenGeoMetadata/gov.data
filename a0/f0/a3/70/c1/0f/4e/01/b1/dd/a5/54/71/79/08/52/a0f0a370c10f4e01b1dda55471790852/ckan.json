    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The reprocessed OMI/Aura Level-2G cloud data product OMCLDO2G, is now available (http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldo2g_v003.shtml) from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) for the public access. It is the second release of V003 and was reprocessed late 2011.\n\n(The shortname for this Level-2G OMI cloud product is OMCLDO2G) \n\nOMI provides two cloud products based on two different algorithms, the Rotational Raman Scattering method and O2-O2 absorption method using the DOAS technique. This level-2 global cloud product is based on the spectral fitting of O2-O2 absorption band at 477 nm using DOAS technique. This product contains cloud pressure, cloud fraction, slant column O2-O2 and Ozone, Ring coefficients, uncertainties in derived parameters, terrain and geolocation information, solar and satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. The short name for this Level-2 OMI cloud product is OMCLDO2G and the lead scientist for this product and for OMCLDO2 (the data source of OMCLDO2G) is KNMI scientist Dr.Pepijn Veefkind.  \n     \nOMCLDO2G data product is a special Level-2 Global Gridded Product where pixel level data (OMCLDO2) are binned into 0.25x0.25 degree global grids. It contains the OMCLDO2 data for all L2 scenes that have observation time between UTC times of 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.9999. All data pixels that fall in a grid are saved 'Without Averaging'. Scientists can apply data filtering scheme of their choice and create new gridded products.\n\nOMCLDO2G product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format(HDF-EOS5). Each daily data file contains data from the day lit portion of the orbits (~14 orbits) and is roughly 85 MB in size. The GES DISC developed interactive tool Giovanni (http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/) provides on-line web based capabilities to browse and explore these data.\n\n      Data Category and Parameters:\n         \n      The OMCLDO2G data file consists of a Grid Data Object which contains\n      complete information of each pixel binned into the grid.           \n         \n         Cloud Parameters:\n           Cloud Fraction, Cloud Pressure (and Precisions)\n            \n         Ancillary Data:\n           Terrain Pressure, Terrain Height, Terrain Reflectivity,\n           Continuum at Reference Wave Length, Ring Coefficient\n           Slant Column Amount O2-O2      \n            \n        Quality Flags:\n            Ground Pixel Quality Flags, Measurement Quality Flags, \n            Processing Quality Flags, Root Mean Square Error of Fit \n      \n        Time and Geolocation Data:\n            Time, Latitude, Longitude, Solar Zenith Angle, Solar Azimuth Angle,\n            Viewing Zenith Angle, Viewing Azimuth Angle, Line Number, \n            Scene Number, Number of Candidate Scenes, Path Length, \n            Orbit Number, Spacecraft Info (altitude, latitude, longitude)",
