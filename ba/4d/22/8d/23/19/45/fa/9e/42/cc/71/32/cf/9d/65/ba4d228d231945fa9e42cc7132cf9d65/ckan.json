    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;This research effort is exploring the concept of launching a rocket from&amp;nbsp;a glider that is towed by an aircraft. The idea is to build a relatively&amp;nbsp;inexpensive remotely piloted glider that could be towed to altitude by a&amp;nbsp;large transport aircraft. The glider would carry a booster rocket capable&amp;nbsp;of launching payloads into orbit. After the rocket launch, the glider would&amp;nbsp;return independently of the tow aircraft to its base to be used again. This&amp;nbsp;approach could significantly reduce the cost and improve the efficiency&amp;nbsp;of sending satellites into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;/strong&gt;: Three separate technical feasibility studies completed&amp;nbsp;by independent contractors indicate the technique could achieve&amp;nbsp;significant performance gains over vertical ground launches of similarsized&amp;nbsp;rockets. The Dryden team has designed and is building a subscale&amp;nbsp;research model to test operational aspects and characterize flight&amp;nbsp;performance and handling qualities. Flight testing and crew training have&amp;nbsp;begun on a single fuselage glider that will be towed to altitude by early&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Future plans involve continuing work to assemble&amp;nbsp;a one-third scale glider model with a 24-foot wingspan to obtain&amp;nbsp;operational experience while under towed flight, as well as performance&amp;nbsp;and handling qualities data. Plans are underway to flight demonstrate a&amp;nbsp;rocket launch from the sub-scale model in 2014. Whittinghill Aerospace&amp;nbsp;is fabricating a rocket for this air launch flight demonstration, under a&amp;nbsp;Phase III SBIR..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More economical:&lt;/strong&gt; Use of a simple remotely&amp;nbsp;piloted glider, without the complex propulsion&amp;nbsp;and crew life support systems required for&amp;nbsp;a crewed, powered aircraft, provides an&amp;nbsp;inexpensive air launch platform&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased payload:&lt;/strong&gt; A towed glider can&amp;nbsp;carry over twice the payload of a dedicated&amp;nbsp;powered aircraft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safer:&lt;/strong&gt; Remotely piloted gliders that are&amp;nbsp;towed 1000+ feet behind the tow plane offer&amp;nbsp;a substantial safety perimeter from the high&amp;nbsp;energy systems inherent in rocket boosters (as&amp;nbsp;compared to other air-launch methodologies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
