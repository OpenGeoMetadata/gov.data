    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop self-healing composites using carbon nanofibers in conjunction with encapsulated resin/hardener.  Polymer matrix composites offering multiple advantages of lightweight, high strength and stiffness, vibration damping, and corrosion resistance are becoming widely used in aerospace and commercial applications.  A primary weakness of structural composites is damage from impact, where resulting microcracks can propagate to allow delamination and/or fiber breakage of the composite, resulting in loss of the excellent physical properties for which composites are selected.  Incorporation of carbon nanofibers (CNF) into the polymer matrix, resulting in a significant increase of the composite interphase, has been shown to mitigate microcrack formation.  CNF additives in the matrix have also demonstrated improvement in interlaminar mechanical properties, thermal and electrical conductivity, vibration damping, and fire retardancy.  A separate promising tool for addressing damage from impact is the emerging class of self-healing materials, having the ability to heal microcracks and restore mechanical and corrosion-resistant properties of the composite.  In the proposed effort, a combination of these tools will be investigated to determine the feasibility of incorporating self-healing, while concurrently producing multifunctional improvements in interlaminar shear strength, modulus, fracture toughness, transport properties, fire retardancy and vibration damping.
