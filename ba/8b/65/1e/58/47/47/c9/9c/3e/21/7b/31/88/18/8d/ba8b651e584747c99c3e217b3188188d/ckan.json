  "notes": " The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL), a extensive facility located on approximately 180 acres, served as a resource in conducting the &amp;quot;Evaluating Roadway Construction Work Zone Interventions&amp;quot; project, which is evaluating interventions that are intended to prevent ground workers from being struck by construction equipment. In defining the data collection methods for this project, it was necessary to develop blind area diagrams of road construction equipment. These diagrams were used to describe areas around equipment that are hazardous to ground workers. The PRL facility was utilized in developing diagrams for four pieces of equipment. In addition, the PRL facility was utilized in a pilot study to evaluate the project data collection techniques on an active asphalt paving operation.  ",
