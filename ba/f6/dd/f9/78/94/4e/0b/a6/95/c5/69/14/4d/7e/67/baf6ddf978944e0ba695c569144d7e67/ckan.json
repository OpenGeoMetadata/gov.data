    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This work directly addresses a technology of interest listed in Section 9, sub-section H1.01 In-Situ Resource Utilization, specifically \"Highly efficient reactors for carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide (CO/CO2) conversion into methane (CH4).\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal will investigate combining recent work that demonstrates outstanding CO2 sorption by third generation ionic liquids (ILs) without an increase in viscosity (even in the presence of water) with adaptations of recently developed methodology for electrochemically reducing and polymerizing CO2 in an aqueous IL to polyethylene. The intention is to demonstrate that this methodology is an excellent candidate for creating a highly efficient reactor for carbon dioxide conversion to methane. Unlike conventional electrolytes, ILs generally have very low vapor pressures.  This will make it possible for them to be used in the much lower pressure Martian atmosphere without the problem of evaporation.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build on the results achieved by other research groups by using our own knowledge and years of experience working with ILs, including electrochemistry, to efficiently reduce CO2.  We will prepare the task-specific 3rd generation ILs and then measure their electrochemical properties; i.e., conductivity, electrochemical window, etc.  These are currently unknown but are important in order to ascertain whether these ILs are suitable for this application.   Anticipating this will be the case, we will then test various electrodes, including TiO2 and silver cathodes, to determine which gives the most selective reduction of CO2 to methane.  The efficiency of the process (including power requirements) will be quantified and compared to the Sebatier and Fischer-Tropsch processes.",
