  "notes": "Acquisition of the Freda Wild tract will be a significant addition to the 80 acre Ritterbush WPA.  Once completed Ritterbush WPA will be a 200 acre USFWS WPA with 120 acres of high quality palustrine wetland in the core of the Whooping Crane migration corridor that will be buffered by 80 acres of unbroken native mixed-grass prairie.  The acquisition and restoration at Ritterbush WPA will triple the available wetland acres at this site.  To date, a variety of project elements outlined in the proposal have been completed.  The Project Leaders and their staff have continued their close coordination to complete the acquisition, restoration, and enhancement of Ritterbush Waterfowl Production Area.  Ducks Unlimited has acquired the Freda Wild tract and is coordinating with the National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Staff in Denver to complete the reality elements that will be required transfer the tract the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The Rainwater Basin (RWB) Wetland Management District (WMD) is has been coordinating with Ducks Unlimited engineers to complete topographic survey, soil survey, and develop the on-site wetland restoration activities.  Ducks Unlimited and USFWS Partners for Fish and Wildlife (PFW) program has worked with Ducks Unlimited to complete landowner agreements to facilitate the work in the watershed.  Actions outlined in these activities include filling abandoned irrigation reuse pits that are short stopping water from reaching the wetland and recontouring waterways to maximize flow to the wetland.  \nAll plans have been finalized and stamped by the Ducks Unlimited engineer.  Although there was a lengthy delay in receiving the U.S. Army Corps of engineers Section 404 Clean Water Act permit all permits are in hand for on-site wetland and off-site watershed restoration activities.  The bid package is expected to be advertised by Ducks Unlimited by September 15th, 2016.    The Rainwater Basin Joint Venture has leveraged funding from the Nebraska Environmental Trust while Ducks Unlimited has a North American Wetlands Conservation Act grant.  These grant funds along with USFWS PFW funds to complete the on- and off-site restoration work.  All construction work and establishment of grazing infrastructure will be completed this fall after harvest and the site should be ready to greet migrating Whooping Cranes in the spring of 2017.",
