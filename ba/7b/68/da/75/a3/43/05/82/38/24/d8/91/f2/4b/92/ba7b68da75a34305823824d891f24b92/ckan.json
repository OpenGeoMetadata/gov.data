    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposal is specifically written to address the need for improved Ka-band T/R modules.  The solicitation calls for investigation and development of core technologies that will significantly improve T/R module performance.  Improvements needed include reduced power consumption, mass, and size.  Hittite Microwave Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company that has been developing microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) for over 19 years.  Hittite proposes three possible areas of focus for the SBIR program, transmitter power amplifiers, receiver integration or complete T/R functionality.  By far the largest contributor to the size and weight of a T/R module is the power amplifier.  Both GaN and MHEMT are new technologies that have the potential for substantial improvement over incumbent PHEMT technology.  MHEMT is most suited to power levels below 4 Watts reverting to the higher power density GaN technology at higher power levels.  Both MHEMT and advanced SiGeBiCMOS technologies such as IBM 8HP can be consider for receiver functions.  Finally MHEMT strikes a good balance as a single technology platform for a moderate power level (&lt;2 Watt transmit) T/R MMIC/module at 35 GHz.  The proposal includes a technology summary as well as basic design considerations and examples of LNAs, PAs and phase shifters.",
