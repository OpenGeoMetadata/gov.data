  "notes": "  At the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), the Savannah River Site Calibration Laboratory is one of the most advanced radiation calibration laboratory and test facilities in the country. SRNL provides instrument test and evaluation services, exercises, calibration and repair, calibration services for tritium monitoring equipment, and radiological instrument qualification and testing. This unique service is available to government agencies, the US Military and commercial organizations.   The SRS Calibration Laboratory   Federally approved for radiation protection and instrument calibration Physical and information security are integral parts of operations Comprehensive capabilities for instrumentation performance testing, calibration, and maintenance First Department of Energy laboratory to be accredited by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) as a Calibration Laboratory for Ionizing Radiation Weapons-grade plutonium, reactor-grade plutonium, and enriched uranium source work capabilities.  The Calibration Laboratory staff is highly-trained, knowledgeable, and has an exemplary safety record. They have participated in such projects as Intelligent Personal Radiation Locator (IPRL) advanced technology demonstrations, the Graduated Rad/Nuc Detector Evaluation and Reporting (GRaDER) program, and the Intelligent Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) testing.
