  "notes": " The world&amp;#39;s second full-scale nuclear reactor was the D Reactor at Hanford which was built in the early 1940&amp;#39;s and went operational in December of 1944.D Reactor ran through June of 1967, and was ultimately cocooned in 2004.  D Reactor is unique in a couple of ways.First, the reactor&amp;#39;s Control Room is the property of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and has occasionally been part of an exhibit and placed on display at the museum.Second, the D Reactor&amp;#39;s early days of operation weren&amp;#39;t as smooth as operators would have liked.  It appears that in the late 1940&amp;#39;s, after the D Reactor had only been operational for a few years, scientists detected a problem with the reactor operations.They were so concerned that D would fail that they built another reactor, called the DR Reactor, right next door.Second, the D Reactor&amp;#39;s early days of operation weren&amp;#39;t as smooth as operators would have liked. By October of 1950, DR (which stands for D-Replacement) Reactor went on line as the fifth plutonium production reactor at Hanford.  At about the same time, the problems associated with the D Reactor were solved, and both D and DR Reactors ran side by side into the mid-1960&amp;#39;s when they were shut down.Since then, both reactors have been cocooned (DR in 2002, D in 2004).D Reactor was one of the Site&amp;#39;s longest serving facilities with twenty-two years of service, while DR was the reactor that was on line for the shortest amount of time, only fourteen years.
