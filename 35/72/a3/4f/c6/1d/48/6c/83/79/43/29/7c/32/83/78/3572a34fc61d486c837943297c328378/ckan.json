The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks such as military installations in the MTDB for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations.  In 2012, the Census Bureau obtained the inventory and boundaries of most military installations from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for Air Force, Army, Marine, and Navy installations and from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for Coast Guard installations.\nThe military installation boundaries in this release represent the updates the Census Bureau made in 2012 in collaboration with DoD.",
