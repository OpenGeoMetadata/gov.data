  "notes": "A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination, and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey). In January 1997, after the first three stages were complete, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. As part of the study to determine the role of oyster reefs in tidal creek ecosystems, an oyster growth and survival research subproject was initiated in August 1997 and completed in November 1999. Four bags of 25 oysters each were placed along the mainstem of each creek at approximately the same elevation; bags were placed between 24 and 150 m from each creek mouth (see 97 Deployment Data file). For each oyster bag deployment, the distance in meters from the mouth of the creek and relative intertidal height was determined. Oyster growth and survival were measured primarily monthly during the pre-manipulation and manipulation stage. During the pre-manipulation stage, after adjusting oyster biomass to 8g dry weight per m3 bank full water volume, the bags of oysters were placed on or near oyster reefs in each creek and the growth and survival were measured. Shell height was used to determine growth, and survival (mortality) was determined by counting the number of dead oysters in each bag. To determine how the presence or absence of mature oyster reefs (manipulation stage) affects oyster growth and survival, the same oyster variables were measured. Pre-manipulation growth and survival data cover the dates from August 18, 1997 through October 16, 1997 and October 21, 1997 through January 23, 1998. Manipulation data are from April 21, 1998 through November 6, 1999. The database also includes calculated daily growth, average growth, and percent survival values.",
