    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Strong interest in whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMR) for use in chip-scale photonic devices is motivated by their high optical quality, mechanical simplicity and extremely compact form. In these circular resonators, the light propagates around the circumference, localized by total internal reflection at the dielectric boundary. The typical WGMR geometry is constrained because the full mode intensity is not accessible. Only a small portion of the mode volume, the evanescent field that exists just outside the disc perimeter, is exposed for external optomechanical coupling or molecular sensing applications. In this research, we make use of focused ion beam (FIB) microfabrication to mill features into the WGMR. FIB engineered disc (FIBED) resonators can be formed with open structure, i.e. a milled notch creates a free space gap within the mode volume. The gap provides access to the internal fields of the resonator, and therefore the full mode intensity. This novel approach allows direct interaction of external mechanisms, atoms, or molecules with the resonant light field. We have demonstrated a calcium fluoride FIBED resonator with optical quality factor (Q) exceeding a million. With our developed FIB process, charge collection and material re-deposition issues have been mitigated, and we observe no effects of gallium ion contamination. In our initial demonstrations, the optical Q appears to be limited by Rayleigh scattering losses from the notch surface roughness. The FIB milling can ultimately achieve 20 times better surface finish, which will greatly enhance the optical Q. This novel open cavity WGMR allows interaction of external mechanisms with the full intensity of the resonant light field. In particular, a mechanical resonator can be engineered within the high-Q cavity to realize a monolithic optomechanical device. Optomechanical coupling to the WGMR field yields extremely high sensitivity to the displacement and motion of the mechanical resonator.&lt;/p&gt;",
