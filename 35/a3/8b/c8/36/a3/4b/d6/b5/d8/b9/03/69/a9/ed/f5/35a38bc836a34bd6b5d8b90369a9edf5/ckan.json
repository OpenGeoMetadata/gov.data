  "notes": "NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as defined by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS). This data set is available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and area features and wetlands attributes. The original digital data as well as the hardcopy maps that were used as the source for the digital data are produced and distributed by the USFWS's National Wetlands Inventory project. The Minnesota Land Management Information Center (LMIC), now the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo), converted the Minnesota NWI files to ARC/INFO coverage format and edge-matched the files. In cooperation with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and USFWS, LMIC revised the legends to correct errors, to add items for individual portions of the NWI code, and to add translations to the Circular 39 wetland classification system.",

      "value": "[\"Use Constraints: Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over wetlands may define and describe wetlands in a different manner than that used in this inventory. There is no attempt, in either the design or products of this inventory, to define the limits of proprietary jurisdiction of any federal, state, or local government or to establish the geographical scope of the regulatory programs of government agencies. Persons intending to engage in activities involving modifications within or adjacent to wetland areas should seek the advice of appropriate federal, state, or local agencies concerning specified agency regulatory programs and proprietary jurisdictions that may affect such activities. NWI information is not intended to be used as a precise locator of wetland boundaries, for site specific planning or management, or for regulatory purposes. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps. See section on Completeness_Report for more information. Also see an article in the National Wetlands Newsletter (March-April 1997; Vol. 19/2, pp. 7-12) entitled NWI Maps: What They Tell Us: http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Documents/NWI-Maps-What-They-Tell-Us.pdf\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"
