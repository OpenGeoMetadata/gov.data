    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop and commercialize a new class of aperiodic multilayer coating that is designed to provide high normal-incidence reflectance over a wide spectral band-pass in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region, specifically from 9 to 14 nm. A broad-band reflective coating working at these wavelengths will enable, for the first time, the construction of high-resolution imaging spectrometers for solar physics utilizing diffraction gratings operating near normal incidence in this range, akin to previous instruments utilizing normal-incidence optics working at longer EUV wavelengths (i.e., lambda&gt;17 nm) such as the Hinode/EIS satellite instrument and the EUNIS sounding rocket instrument. The development of high-resolution, normal-incidence grating spectrometers operating in the 9&amp;#150;14 nm range will in turn allow for detailed investigations of important solar emission lines, such as those from Fe XVIII &amp;#150; XXIII, that can provide unique diagnostics of high temperature plasma associated with solar flares and active regions. The successful development of efficient, broad-band EUV multilayers for the 9&amp;#150;14 nm region as we propose will thus enable future flights of the EUNIS rocket to target this band, and will also enable the development of high resolution spectrometers that can meet the science requirements of future NASA satellite missions, such as RAM, Solar-C and others that are currently being contemplated.",
