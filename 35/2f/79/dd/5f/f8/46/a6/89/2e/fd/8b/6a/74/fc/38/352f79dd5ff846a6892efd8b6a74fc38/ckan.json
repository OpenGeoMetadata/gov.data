  "notes": "The California Clapper rail (Rallus lonqirostris obsoletus) is a seldom seen  resident in some of the remaining tidal salt marshes in San Francisco Bay. The  California clapper rail was listed as an endangered species by the federal  government in 1970 and by the state of California in 1971. Since then, much  effort has been given to studying, preserving and protecting the sensitive tidal  marsh habitat of the clapper rail. Several researchers have censused clapper  rail populations in San Francisco Bay during the past twenty years. Gill (1979)  conducted censuses in the bay as well as along the coast of California in the  early 1970's. Harvey (1980, 1981) and Gull Moss (1980) estimated the wintering population of clapper rails within the tidal salt marshes of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). Former Refuge biologist Tom Harvey and Department of Fish and Game biologist Paul Kelly have regularly conducted rail censuses in the bay throughout the 1980's. Harvey (1987) presented the results of his censuses at the annual meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union held at San Francisco State University. Several members of the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory (SFBBO) have been actively involved in clapper rail censuses (SFBBO 1986). In addition, a joint SFBBO and Refuge project directed at the color banding of clapper rails was conducted between 1983 and 1985. A progress report was prepared (SFBBO 1986) summarizing the project. In this summary, we report on censuses of clapper rails in selected marshes in south San Francisco Bay during the winter of 1988-1989. The surveys were carried out as a cooperative effort between representatives from the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with assistance from the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.",
