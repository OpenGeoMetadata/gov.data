    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Prognostics methodologies determine the health state of a system and predict the end of life and remaining useful life. This information enables operators to take maintenance related decisions, thus effectively streamlining operational and mission-level activities. Prognostics testbeds help in the prototyping, development, and maturation of prognostic technologies. In this work, we present a prognostics testbed for pneumatic valves. Pneumatic valves are critical components in many industrial\r\nprocesses, and the testbed will be used to showcase how remaining life prediction works in the context of cryogenic refueling operations. The testbed allows for the injection of time-varying leaks\r\nwith specified damage progression profiles in order to emulate common valve faults. In addition, the testbed contains a battery used to power some components, allowing the study of the effects of battery degradation on the operation of the valves. Prognostic algorithms will utilize sensor data collected from the different transducers in order to estimate component health and make life predictions, based on mathematical models describing the underlying physics of component degradation and employing a Bayesian filtering algorithm for state-parameter estimation from\r\nwhich life predictions are made.",
