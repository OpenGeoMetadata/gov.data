    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides an integrated collection of (1) ground-based meteorological, radiometric, and vegetation measurements, (2) flux-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP), and (3) numerous vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery for three eddy covariance flux tower locations near Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. Land use surrounding the towers is cropland with corn and soybeans. Data are reported for selected days during the growing seasons of 2001 through 2008 only when ground-based crop canopy reflectance was measured. Algorithms developed to relate ground-based and satellite spectral information to GPP of the cropland adjacent to the towers are provided. AmeriFlux tower-based Level 2 measurements included photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), heat flux, and GPP estimates; see Section 2 for specific towers.Ground-based measurements on the corn and soybean vegetation surrounding the towers included total chlorophyll content (Chl) and leaf area index (LAI). Ground-based crop canopy reflectance was measured at 5.4 m above the corn and soybean canopy using hyperspectral radiometers (range 400 to 1100 nm) during the growing season from May to October in eight different years (2001-2008). This resulted in 173 measurement campaigns (18 in 2001, 31 in 2002, 34 in 2003, 31 in 2004, 21 in 2005, 15 in 2006, 14 in 2007, and 9 in 2008). Spectral bands from Landsat TM and ETM+, MERIS , and MODIS instruments were used to calculate vegetation indices. Vegetation indices related to chlorophyll can be used as a proxy for GPP because of the observed close relationship between GPP and Chl content in crops. Algorithms developed to relate spectral information to the GPP of the cropland adjacent to the towers are provided as companion files.",
