  "notes": "This is a line dataset of navigated waterways fitting the LOSCO definition: it has been traveled by vessels transporting 10,000 gallons of oil or fuel as determined by extensive research conducted by LSU Department of Geography & Anthropology. All waterways south of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway are assumed to be navigated as are all waterways within the Atchafalaya Basin so they were not digitized, and they are not part of this dataset. The line strings of this data set were created by heads-up digitizing following center lines of channels on the LOSCO Thematic Mapper mosaic. The lines are attributed with the length of stream segments and names. The names of the navigated waterways were researched from maps and local knowledge.",
