  "notes": " FUNCTION: Fabricates unique, state-ofthe-art optical fibers based on pure or doped silica glass systems. It has the capability of fabricating both single-mode and multimode fibers doped with germanium, phosphorus, and fluorine and holey fibers containing photosensitive and/or laser-active elements. In addition, it can fabricate fibers with cores doped with high concentrations of laser-active ions such as erbium, ytterbium, and neodymium, together with aluminum. The facility supports Navy and DoD programs in fiber-optic sensing, nuclear radiation hardness, optical limiting, fiber-optic tethers, high-power fiber lasers, and small fibers with low visibility. DESCRIPTION: The facility consists of two parts: the Preform Fabrication Laboratory and the Fiber Draw Laboratory. In the Preform Fabrication Laboratory, optical fiber preforms are fabricated using the modified chemical vapor deposition process. The optical cladding and core are deposited layer by layer, and then the preform is collapsed into a solid rod whose refractive index profile and core/clad ratio are preserved in fiber drawing. In the Fiber Draw Laboratory, the preform is slowly lowered into a high-temperature furnace at the top of the 24-ft draw tower. The glass softens and the optical fiber is drawn out of the bottom of the furnace; the fiber diameter and draw tension are monitored using noncontact techniques. Fiber Bragg gratings may be written into the fiber with short pulses of UV light from an excimer laser. The fiber is coated with a polymer to protect its surfaceand preserve its intrinsic strength. INSTRUMENTATION: In the Preform Fabrication Laboratory, the reagent gases and rare earth chelate delivery systems are electronically metered. Deposition temperature and preform diameter are monitored, and a computer provides closed-loop control by varying torch temperature and exhaust back pressure. During drawing, the fiber diameter and coating concentricity are monitored with laser-based optical instruments. A noncontact instrument measures draw tension. In the grating writing process, the Bragg wavelength is computer controlled, and the computer also synchronizes the draw process with the firing of the pulsed UV laser to determine the spacing of the gratings along the fiber. The grating positions are marked with an inkjet bar code printer.  ",
