    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Eddy correlation and micrometeorological measurements began in 2001 and continued through 2005 at the pasture site at km 77 on BR-163 just south of the city of Santarem, Para, Brazil. Measurements included turbulent fluxes (momentum, heat, water vapor, and CO2) using the eddy covariance (EC) approach. Other measurements included the CO2 profile, air temperature, humidity, wind speed profile, downward and upward solar and terrestrial radiation, downward and upward photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), atmospheric pressure, rainfall, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil heat flux. Data are presented in 5 comma-separated ASCII value (csv) files each corresponding roughly to one calendar year. At the beginning of the measurements, in September 2000, the field was a pasture. In November 2001, the pasture was burned, plowed, and planted in upland (non-irrigated) rice. Land use practices during the study period were recorded and are included in a table in Section 5 of this guide.The EC system was composed of a 3D sonic anemometer (ATI 3D) and an infrared analyzer (LICOR 6262) installed on a 20m tower in the agricultural field. The methodology to calculate the flux is described in detail in Sakai et al. (2004) and a companion file is included that describes in detail the formulae used to calculate the eddy flux variables  (CD03_Pasture_Flux_Calculations.pdf).  ",
