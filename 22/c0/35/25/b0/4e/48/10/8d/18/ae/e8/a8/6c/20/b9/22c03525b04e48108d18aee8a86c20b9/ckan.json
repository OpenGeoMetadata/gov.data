    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Combinatorial methods are proposed to develop advanced Aqueous Oxidation Catalysts (AOCs) with the capability to mineralize organic contaminants present in effluents from current and future primary wastewater treatment processes at temperatures less than 70aC, pressures below 20 psig, and contact times under 30 minutes.  The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration and identify rate-limiting factors for contaminant oxidation identified in the best Phase I AOCs.  A new series of combinatorial catalysts will be prepared with the goal to systematically improve catalyst performance.  Improvements will focus on contaminant and reaction byproduct adsorption, mass transfer resistances, and reaction rate limitations associated with noble metal concentration, dispersion, and support interaction.  A second-generation combinatorial library with 102 AOCs will be prepared based on this analysis.  Oxidation activity will then be compared using a difficult to oxidize ersatz solution containing contaminants known to occur in the current U.S. water processor aboard the ISS.  These tests will select the best AOC based upon analysis of oxidation kinetics.  This AOC will undergo long-term testing to verify performance.  Scale-up activities will follow, resulting in a full-scale, deliverable prototype.  The advanced AOC will lower water processor ESM and provide multiple commercial opportunities.",
