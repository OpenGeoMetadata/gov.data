    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Air Quality Monitor (AQM) on-board ISS provides specific information for a number of target compounds in the air. However, there is a significant subset of common target compounds between air and water.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, the following question arises, &amp;ldquo;Can the AQM be used for both air and water quality monitoring?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Previous directorate-level IR&amp;amp;D funding led to the development of a water sample introduction method for mass spectrometry using electro-thermal vaporization (ETV).&amp;nbsp; This vaporization source allows analytes in water samples to enter the gas phase, where they can be analyzed using a variety of techniques.&amp;nbsp; This project will focus on the integration of the ETV with a ground-based AQM.&amp;nbsp; The capabilities of this integrated platform will be evaluated using a subset of toxicologically important compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETV unit was constructed using two glass tubes and a nichrome ribbon powered by a programmable DC power supply (G W Instec, PSM-3004).&amp;nbsp; The nichrome ribbon was threaded through two 3-mm wide, 1-cm-long slot cuts on the inner tube placed 1.5 cm past the inlet.&amp;nbsp; The ribbon was held securely by compressing it between the inner tube and two halves of an outer glass tube.&amp;nbsp; These halves were held together using a flexible metal clamp.&amp;nbsp; Inside the inner tube the ribbon was slightly curved, and an indent (1 mm diameter) was made on its surface for depositing a measured liquid sample drop.&amp;nbsp; The ribbon was positioned in the upper half of the inner tube in such a way that the edge of the ribbon faced the front (inlet) side of the ETV unit.&amp;nbsp; Holes (1 mm diameter) were made on the outer and inner glass tubes for sample introduction and were aligned with the ribbon indent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viability of the ETV approach for the analysis of water analytes was demonstrated using a ground-based, laboratory scale analyzer (reference:&amp;nbsp; Dwivedi, P. et al.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Electro-Thermal Vaporization Direct Analysis in Real Time-Mass Spectrometry for Water Contaminant Analysis During Space Missions,&amp;rdquo; Analytical Chemistry, 85, 9898-9906 (2013)).&amp;nbsp; The work in this proposal will extend that effort and interface the ETV to a ground version of the current in-flight AQM.&amp;nbsp; Liquid sample will be introduce via a pipet through the sample injection port and placed onto the nichrome ribbon heated to a set temperature by an external, programmable power supply.&amp;nbsp; Upon vaporization of the water sample, the target analytes will be swept into the AQM Sample-In port using nitrogen carrier gas.&amp;nbsp; A vapor-phase analysis can then be performed by the AQM to identify and quantify the target analytes in the water samples.&amp;nbsp; Parameters to be optimized include water sample size, carrier gas sweep rate, and ribbon temperature.&amp;nbsp; The operating parameters of the vapor-phase analysis performed by the AQM will also need to be modified for this type of sampling methodology.&amp;nbsp; A simple two-position valve attached to the ETV and a diverter tube will allow for manual selection of either a water sample through the ETV or an air sample through the diverter tube.&amp;nbsp; The primary objective of this effort is to evaluate the viability of the ETV with ground-based, flight hardware.&amp;nbsp; A proof-of-concept unit capable of water and air analysis utilizing the ETV will be developed.&amp;nbsp; The target water analytes to be used in this work will come from a list provided by the water SMEs in the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry Laboratories at JSC.&amp;nbsp; These analytes are commonly observed in the ground analysis of water samples from ISS.&amp;nbsp; A preliminary engineering evaluation of this set-up could potentially be performed with the goal of formulating a viable plan of integrating the ETV to the control software and power supply of the AQM.&amp;nbsp; This plan could serve as a starting point for further development.&amp;nbsp; This work will advance this project from a TRL of 3 to a TRL of 5. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
