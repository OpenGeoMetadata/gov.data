    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Optical tracking and identification sensors have numerous NASA and non-NASA applications. For example, airborne or spaceborne imaging sensors are used to visualize and track vehicles during launch and landing operations. Existing identification and tracking sensors cannot meet some of the advanced performance requirements including wide field of view (FOV) for panoramic situation awareness, high spatial resolution for detailed object shape discrimination, high spectral resolution for object material signature recognition, and fast response for transit event or moving objects tracking and identification, as well as low weight, volume and power requirements, et al. There is a demand to investigate innovative and unconventional optical or hyperspectral imaging systems to enhance the ability of today's tracking and identification systems for NASA as well as non-NASA applications. New Span Opto-Technology Inc. proposes herein a novel optical configuration that is capable of simultaneously providing wide FOV hyperspectral imaging for object detection and high spatial resolution in areas of interest without mechanical scanning for precise object recognition, positioning and tracking. In Phase I we will establish the model, demonstrate the feasibility, and recognize challenging issues of the proposed concept.",
