    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate, based on a new class of electronic devices called solid state vacuum devices (SSVD?s), a highly promising enabling technology for extreme high temperature radiation hard electronics.  SSVD?s marry solid state semiconductor technology, including the process fabrication techniques, with vacuum electronics, and, in this case, specifically thermionic vacuum electronics. SSVD?s have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVD?s, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.  SSVD?s should be extremely well suited for extreme environments that, for example, exist on or near Venus.  Currently no existing electronics can address this extreme environment.  InnoSys proposes to demonstrate thermionic SSVD? triodes/field effect transistors and the associated assembly and sealing to meet the requirements needed for extreme high temperature electronics.  In particular, to demonstrate this capability, 460oC electronics for low noise (less than 10 nanovolt/square root(Hz)) and 0 to 100 volt or higher output circuitry and appropriate innovative temperature and pressure assemblies and sealing techniques needed for reliable and sustained operation of SSVD? devices for NASA robotic, sensor and actuators applications will be studied.
