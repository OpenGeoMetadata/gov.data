  "notes": "This dataset describes the depth to bedrock (based on 100-foot contour intervals) and the areas of significant bedrock outcrops in Minnesota, as delineated by the Minnesota Geological Survey. It is an automated version of the Minnesota Geological Survey State Map Series Map S-14 (Geologic Map of Minnesota: Depth to Bedrock), 1982, by B.M. Olsen and J.H. Mossler. (1:1,000,000). The file is a modification of the published map. The file was modified by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to create closed polygons where none existed on the base map. This occurred primarily in the northwestern portion of the state, where few data points existed to draw contour lines, but where the depth to bedrock is generally high. This was done in order to enable the creation of a polygon digital coverage. The Arc/Info version of the dataset has been broken into two layers: depth to bedrock (DPTHBDRK) and outcrops (OUTCROP). The EPPL grid version exists as one file (DEPTHCROP.EPP)",
