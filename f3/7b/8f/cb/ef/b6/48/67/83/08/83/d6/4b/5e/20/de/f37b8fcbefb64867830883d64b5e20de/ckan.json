  "notes": "The following is excerpted from Evans et al., J.Geophys. Res., in review, 1998 (please see this paper for references made in this readme file): Proxy climate data derived from the isotopic composition and chemistry of aragonite formed by massive reef corals provide a supplementary data set for the study of the tropical near-surface climate [Cole et al., 1993; Dunbar et al., 1994; Linsley et al., 1994; Tudhope et al., 1995; Charles et al., 1997]. Given constant sea water o18 and biological processes, variability in the oxygen isotopic composition (o18) of coralline aragonite is a function of the sea surface temperature in which the coral secreted its skeleton [Epstein et al., 1953; Weber and Woodhead, 1972; McConnaughey, 1989]. However, coral o18 also records changes in the o18 of sea water [Cole et al., 1993; Linsley et al., 1994; McCulloch et al., 1994] if freshwater flux variance is significant. The Strontium:Calcium (Sr/Ca) ratio in corals has been shown to be a function of sea surface temperature as well, with minimal sea water Sr/Ca influence [Weber, 1973; Schneider and Smith, 1979; Beck et al., 1992; DeVilliers et al., 1994; Shen et al., 1996]. Application of these two proxy measurements in tandem has been used to distinguish sea water o18 and sea surface temperature anomalies recorded on the Great Barrier Reef during the 1982-3 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event [McCulloch et al., 1994]. We made measurements of stable isotopic composition (o18 and c13) and Sr/Ca on a coral collected live from Kiritimati (Christmas) Island (157.3 W, 2 N), in the Republic of Kiribati. Kiritimati lies at the eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool and just west of the NINO3 box (Fig. 1). The seasonal range of sea surface temperature (SST) is less than 1.2 degrees C. Because the seasonal cycle is modest, ENSO-induced warm and cold phase sea surface temperature anomalies of +/-3 degrees C are prominent [Bjerknes, 1969; Wyrtki, 1975; Wyrtki, 1985; Philander, 1990]. By contrast, ENSO-driven precipitation anomalies are moderate in magnitude and brief in duration, creating a minor change in sea water o18 due to enhanced rainfall [Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987] and eastward advection of lower salinity water [Picaut et al., 1996]. Thus, Kiritimati is an ideal location from which to monitor the thermal signal associated with the full ENSO cycle and should record features similar to those in the NINO3 region. Data and Methods: Stable isotope data Coral PP7-3 was collected live and cored at South West Point, Kiritimati Island, at 9 meters depth in March 1994. The coral has been identified as Porites sp., probably P. australiensis, possibly P. lobata [D. Potts, UCSC, pers. comm.]. The core was slabbed along the growth axis and X-radiographed for densitometry study; slabs were then ultrasonically cleaned in de-ionized water and dried at 50 degrees C prior to sampling. Samples for oxygen and carbon isotope analyses were drilled from the slab at 0.5 mm intervals starting from just below the most recent growth and extending to a maximum depth of 1004 mm. A precise age model was recoverable for the upper 839.5 mm. Samples were drilled from lines chosen parallel to the axis of maximum growth to avoid non-temporal (i.e. potential differential growth-related) isotopic effects [McConnaughey, 1989]. X-ray diffraction analyses of drilled and chipped coral aragonite verify that samples were 100% aragonite after drilling. Sequential isotopic analyses were made using a Finnigan MAT-251 gas source mass spectrometer coupled to a Carousel-48 automated sample preparation device. Measurement precisions (1-sigma) were +/-0.06 per mil and +/- 0.04 per mil for o18 and c13 analyses, based on analysis of a lab standard; sample replication over the 1981-1987 period (see section on Sr/Ca data below) gives an external precision of +/- 0.09 per mil in the o18 time series shown in Fig. 2. All stable isotope measurements are reported",
