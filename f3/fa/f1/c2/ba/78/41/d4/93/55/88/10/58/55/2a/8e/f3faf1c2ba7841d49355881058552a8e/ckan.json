  "notes": "This data set indicates the locations of oyster leases in Louisiana. The lease areas should be polygons, however, the source data has very poor topology including many 'polygons' which do not close and polygons which overlap. Additionally, adjacent polygons do not always share a side, but appear to replicate it without exact overlap (there are frequent gaps between polygons). It is not always clear if these gaps are just errors in the geometric description of the lease areas or represent unleased channels between the leases. For these reasons, the coverage has only been built as a line coverage. There are no useful attributes or labeling associated with the lease areas. The attributes that are associated with the data are a result of the conversion from a Microstation drawing file to an Arc Info coverage. The lineage of the source data is unclear, but the understanding is that a LADWF dataset was obtained/modified by LDNR, the USCOE obtained these data from LDNR, and may have done further processing including projection before providing the source data to LOSCO.",
