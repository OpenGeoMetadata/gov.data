Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans. The digital surface model represents percent canopy cover (between 0 and 1). Cover metric was computed in Fusion (McGaughey 2007), which assesses the percentage of total first returns within each cell that were returned from the canopy. For more specifics on Fusion Gridmetric outputs see the fusion manual (page 56).",
