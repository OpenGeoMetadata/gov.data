  "notes": " FUNCTION: Conducts experimental studies of high-energy lasers (HEL) for directed energy (DE) applications. These include the study of HEL beam combining architectures such as the incoherent combining of high-power single-mode fiber lasers; HEL atmospheric propagation physics of turbulence, aerosol scattering and absorption, and thermal blooming effects; HEL interaction with optical components; and the mitigation of atmospheric propagation effects through adaptive optics. Laboratory and field experiments are conducted for these studies. DESCRIPTION: The facility consists of a set of four high-power, single-transverse-mode, continuous-wave (CW) ytterbium fiber lasers, and a CW, high-power (700 W) neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser. The power of the four fiber lasers are 1 kW, 1.6 kW, 1.6 kW, and 2 kW, for a total power of 6.2 kW. The excellent beam quality (M  2   ~1)  at these unique and state-of-the-art power levels enables longrange propagation with minimal beam divergence. The facility laboratory has a propagation length of over 20 meters, extendable to longer distances with reflective optics, and has high-power laser and beam diagnostics. The laboratory also has aerosol generation equipment to simulate maritime aerosol conditions for HEL-aerosol interaction experiments. Field experiments at multiplekilometer ranges are performed at DoD facilities around the country. INSTRUMENTATION: Laser and beam diagnostics include power meters capable of measuring 10 kW beam power, a beam profiling system for precision measurement of M  2  , high-speed video camera for measurement of turbulence- and thermal blooming-induced beam distortions, digital highspeed framing camera for studying aerosol scattering and absorption, spectrometers, gated and un-gated optical image intensifiers, and several pulsed and CW probe lasers. For field experiments, there are mobile laser enclosures, laser cooling water chillers, and remote controls for both laser operation and beam steering.  ",
