    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "SolRad-Net (Solar Radiation Network) is an established network of ground-based sensors providing high-frequency solar flux measurements in quasi-realtime to the scientific community and various other end users. This network was implemented as a companion to AERONET and its instrumentation are invariably collocated with AERONET sites.  The Brazilian core of the present network was developed within the scientific framework of the LBA-ECO component of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazônia. Historically, SolRad-Nethas preferentially selected sites that routinely experience intervals of biomass-burning, such as Amazônia and Sub-Saharan Africa for its long-term monitoring. Data that have been cleared as free of any operational problems are designated as Level 1.5. The raw, unscreened data are Level 1.0 by default and may contain observations that have been compromised for any of the (occasionally subtle) reasons described above. The Level 1.0 data are made available in the interest of presenting a comprehensive  dataset and to provide full transparency of our methods, however any use of these data is strongly discouraged. Data are available from several flux instruments including filtered and unfiltered pyranometers, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) energy and quantum sensors, and UV-A and UV-B flux sensors. To maintain the integrity of the database and fairness to the individuals who have contributed, use of these data for publication requires an offer of authorship to the SolRad-Net PI(s).",
