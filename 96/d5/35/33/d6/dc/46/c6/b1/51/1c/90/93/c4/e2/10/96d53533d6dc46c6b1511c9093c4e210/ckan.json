    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Advanced propulsion technologies such as Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) have been partially limited by the mass of thermal rejection systems.  NEP was proposed for the Jupiter Icy Moons Obiter (JIMO).  Use of novel, lightweight, high-temperature radiator materials, such as those which will be studied in the proposed effort could greatly reduce the mass required for the radiators and help enable NASA exploration missions like JIMO using NEP or other advanced propulsion technologies. Other areas that would potentially benefit from the results of this work include spacecraft heat rejection systems and surface nuclear power. \nGraphene is a two-dimensional atomic-scale honeycomb lattice made of carbon atoms.  This same honeycomb lattice is the basic structural element of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon fibers.  While high-quality graphene films are only available in atomic-scale thicknesses, high-conductivity carbon fibers and woven cloth made from CNTs are available commercially in quantity.  A novel aspect of the proposed effort is to use graphene-based materials including both high-conductivity carbon fibers and CNT cloth in radiator applications in order to take advantage of several key properties of these materials: low density, high thermal conductivity and anisotropic heat transfer.  Modeling results show that a carbon-fiber-based radiator can provide a ten-fold improvement in heat transfer per unit mass compared to the current state-of-the-art molybdenum-based high-temperature radiators.\nThe heat pipe simulator developed in Phase 1 of this effort will be used for testing.  A heater is used to simulate the heat pipe envisioned in space.  A test article fabricated using the material to be studied is secured to the heater and placed in chamber and heated to the test temperature in a vacuum of about 10-6 Torr.Temperatures in the range of 400 ? 600 :C were tested. Optical diagnostics provide temperature data, including pyrometry and thermal imaging.",
