  "notes": "Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of two or more adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) that have significant employment interchanges.  The CBSAs that combine to create a CSA retain separate identities within the larger CSA.  Because CSAs represent groupings of CBSAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual CBSAs.",
