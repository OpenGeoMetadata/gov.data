  "notes": "The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located 16 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado on the borders of Boulder, Broomfield, and Jefferson Counties and was authorized by Congress in 2001. Rocky Flats NWR was once the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, a portion of a 6,240-acre former nuclear weapons production facility operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). All weapons manufacturing, specifically the manufacturing of plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads, was performed in a 600-acre area in the middle of the site known as the Industrial Area. In 1992, weapons production at Rocky Flats site ceased and environmental cleanup and closure began. The DOE completed the cleanup in accordance with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement under oversight from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). Under the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 (Rocky Flats Act), most of the 6,240-acre Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site became the Rocky Flats NWR in 2007 following certification from the EPA that cleanup and closure had been completed; because of ongoing monitoring requirements, the Central Operable Unit in the center of the refuge will remain under the jurisdiction of the DOE. In accordance with the Rocky Flats Act, land up to 300 feet in width extending west from the existing Indiana Street transportation corridor shall be made available by easement or sale for the sole purpose of transportation improvements upon application from any county, city, or political subdivision of the State of Colorado, provided that the transportation improvements “are carried out so as to minimize adverse effects on the management of Rocky Flats as a wildlife refuge” and are part of the approved Denver regional transportation plan. The Service proposes to expand the acquisition boundary of Rocky Flats NWR to accommodate a potential land exchange at the refuge. Acquisition boundaries are administrative lines delineating areas within which the Service has the authority to acquire interests in land. Many species of wildlife make use of the land within the proposed expanded boundary. The property includes quality habitat for the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse, a federally threatened species that inhabits the riparian area along Woman Creek. A herd of resident mule deer uses the site, and elk are known to move through this parcel into the adjacent refuge from mountain habitat in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The acquisition of an interest in this parcel would protect this important wildlife corridor by connecting Rocky Flats NWR to regional open space to the west, providing a permanently protected path to the Front Range. In addition to allowing normal wildlife movement, the acquisition of this corridor would provide ecological resiliency by allowing migration and re-colonization following major disturbances such as disease, fire, and long-term environmental change. The expansion of the refuge to the west in order to permanently conserve this land would be in keeping with the vision that was articulated in the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan.",
