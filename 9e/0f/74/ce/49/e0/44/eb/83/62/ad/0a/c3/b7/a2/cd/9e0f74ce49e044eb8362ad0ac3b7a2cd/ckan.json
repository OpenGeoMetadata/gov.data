    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Global Technology Connection, Inc. in conjunction with its partner, Vanderbilt University, is proposing to build a Fusion-enhanced Vehicle Diagnostics System (FVDS) framework to combine various information to help make go/no-go decisions from a safety point of view.  Specifically single vehicle will be pursued by looking at each aircraft as a single entity.  The system will ensure that the aircraft will make the next maintenance interval by catching errors in the shop and/or detecting emerging problems to maintain vehicle safety between major inspection intervals with an emphasis on the subsystems of airframe, avionics, and propulsion.  The system will provide condition indicators, using model-based or data-driven approaches, from a subsystems' or components' point of view, and these will be fused, using the hybrid modeling based on Bayesian theory and/or graph theory, to provide overall safety from a system point of view.   \r\n\r\nFVDS approach consists of a multi-level processing architecture that includes three levels of reasoners: \r\n1. Individual Components and Line Replaceable Units that provide BIT test, sensor measurements and control commands to track the behavior of the particular component, and report faulty and abnormal conditions; \r\n2. Subsystem reasoners to monitor the state of health of the airframe subsystem; and\r\n3. System or Vehicle level reasoner to combine diagnostic and prognostic information from the individual subsystems, puts them on a time line, and also analyzes cascades of faults.",
