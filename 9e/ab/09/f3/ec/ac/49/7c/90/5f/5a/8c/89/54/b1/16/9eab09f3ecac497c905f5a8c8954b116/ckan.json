  "notes": "This shapefile denotes the location of underwater photos and videos taken in shallow water (0-35m) benthic habitats surrounding Northeast Puerto Rico and Culebra Island. The area includes the nearshore waters of Fajardo and Luqillo to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound, La Cordillera Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island. The Accuracy Assessment data contains GPS-positioned underwater photo/videos of selected benthic habitats that were used to assess the accuracy of the benthic habitat polygons created by the Biogeography Team. The observations from the videos are used to rate the amount of error in the polygons that delineate habitat features. The AA data was collected in September 3 Â– 15, 2014. The field work was conducted by NOAA together with local DRNA and NOAA contractors.",
