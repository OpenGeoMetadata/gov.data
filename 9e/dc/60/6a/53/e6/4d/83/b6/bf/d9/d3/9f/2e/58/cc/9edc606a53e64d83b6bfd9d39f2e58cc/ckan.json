    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "There is an extraordinary need for a universal biomedical analyzer that has broadly flexible capabilities for cell studies, small animal experiments, and crew member health.  The goal of our rHEALTH X device is to create a single palm-sized device with tripartite capabilities:  non-invasive measurements, cell cytometry analysis, and multiplexed nanostrip tests.  Currently, there is no single device that is able to provide comprehensive non-invasive measurements, let alone combine it with the rHEALTH's significant wet laboratory analytical capabilities.  We have developed the existing rHEALTH technology in collaboration with NASA and here, in this Phase I proposal, we intend to further push the envelope and add a fully non-invasive module.  The module will include measurements of heart rate, SpO2, body temperature, respiratory rate, and EKG.  The module will be housed in the back of the rHEALTH X and will be fully detachable for wireless/wearable applications.  At the end of Phase I, we will develop a TRL 4 non-invasive module.  For Phase II, we will integrate the module with our existing rHEALTH technology into the rHEALTH X.  We will bring it to TRL 7, so that it can be flight-certified and flown on the International Space Station (ISS) in a timely manner.",
