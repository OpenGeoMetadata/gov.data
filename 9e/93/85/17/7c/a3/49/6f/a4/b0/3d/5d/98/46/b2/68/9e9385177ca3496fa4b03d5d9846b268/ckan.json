Some of the more common landmark types include\n               area landmarks such as airports, cemeteries, parks, mountain peaks/summits, schools,\n               and churches and other religious institutions. The Census Bureau has added landmark\n               features to MTDB on an as-needed basis and made no attempt to ensure that all\n               instances of a particular feature were included. The presence or absence of a\n               landmark such as a hospital or prison does not mean that the living quarters\n               associated with that landmark were geocoded to that census tabulation block or\n               excluded from the census enumeration.
