  "notes": " FUNCTION: Provides NP-3D aircraft host platforms for Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems (ENEWS) Program antiship missile (ASM) seeker simulators used for electronic warfare (EW) effectiveness assessment in an at-sea environment. This capability provides the Navy&amp;#39;s research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E) and operational communities with unique assets and realistic methods for evaluating surface Navy EW systems. DESCRIPTION: The Flying Electronic Warfare Laboratoryprovides ASM threat representation through the adaptationof a host of missile seeker simulators. These simulatorsuse a combination of hardware and software to modelthe external parameters and internal functions of variousthreat systems. Operational testing against ships&amp;#39; EW assetsis enhanced through the unique ability to provide realtimefeedback of the effectiveness of electronic attack (EA)responses to the threat seeker&amp;#39;s stimuli. Fifteen differentsimulators representing various ASM threat types are availableas part of the ENEWS Program. Up to eight simulatorscan be operated simultaneously to exercise the onboard/offboard EW assets being tested. Internally mountedequipment racks contain seeker control panels, datadisplays, data acquisition systems, and communicationssystems that are organic to each simulator. Special featuresinclude the ability to monitor and record simulator status,receiver/processor functions and select decision logic. The laboratory supports RDT&amp;amp;E and operational activities on a worldwide basis, providing EW testing support to U.S. and NATO programs and those of individual countries. INSTRUMENTATION: Two NP-3D aircraftare configured to carry the simulators.These simulators represent a large cross-sectionof the threat missile systems availableworldwide and are derived from other programsor are hardware systems modified torepresent various threat seekers. All of thesimulators are one-of-a-kind systems, withthe associated instrumentation tailored tothe individual simulator. GPS and data linksystems allow the collection of aircraft andship&amp;#39;s position information for ground truthdetermination.  ",
