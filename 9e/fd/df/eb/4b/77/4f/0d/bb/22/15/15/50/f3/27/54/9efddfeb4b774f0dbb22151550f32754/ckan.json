    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Dust mitigation is critical to the survivability of vehicle and infrastructure components and systems and to the safety of astronauts during EVAs and planetary surface operations. The proposed project seeks to demonstrate a broadly applicable and extremely space durable dust mitigation technology by combining transparent conductive circuits, based on carbon nanotechnology, with electrodymanic shielding. Presently metals and metal oxides are used to form the electrodes in electrodynamic dust mitigation devices.  However the simple substitution of these traditional materials with nanocomposite conductors will provide a far more space durable electrode applicable to a broader array of surfaces and applications. The resulting dust mitigation system will have broad common value to its own mission and to other mission directorates. This approach exploits the unique capabilities of singlewalled carbon nanotubes and binders to form conductive circuits with existing dust mitigation technology developed at NASA-KSC. This approach provide the widest utility making the combined technologies suitable for vehicle structures, spacesuits, modular infrastructure, lightweight deployable and inflatable structures, and habitats. The thin transparent dust shield technology will mitigate the effects of charge, dust and other contaminates on materials, electronics and other space systems.  This technology will provide significant improvement in robustness, reliability, and safety. The proposed project will build from a foundation created by NASA and Eikos over the past ten years. It is a natural extension of both efforts to combine Eikos Invisicon technology with the dust mitigation technology being conducted at KSC.",
