  "notes": "This NYC Reservoirs Watershed Areas (HUC 12) GIS layer was derived from the 12-Digit National Watershed Boundary Database (WBD) at 1:24,000 for EPA Region 2 and Surrounding States. HUC 12 polygons were selected from the source based on interactively comparing these HUC 12s in our GIS with images of the New York City's Water Supply System Map found at http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/wsmaps_wide.shtml. The 12 digit Hydrologic Units (HUCs) for EPA Region 2 and surrounding states (Northeastern states, parts of the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico and the USVI) are a subset of the National Watershed Boundary Database (WBD), downloaded from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Geospatial Gateway and imported into the EPA Region 2 Oracle/SDE database. This layer reflects 2009 updates to the WBD that included new boundary data for New York and New Jersey.",
