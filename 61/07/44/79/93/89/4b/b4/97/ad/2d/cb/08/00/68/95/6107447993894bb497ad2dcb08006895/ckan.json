Vector polygons in this data set represent the management area boundaries. Location-specific type and source information are stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Central California. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. See also the SOCECON (Socioeconomic Resource Points) data layer, part of the larger Central California ESI database, for additional human-use information.",
