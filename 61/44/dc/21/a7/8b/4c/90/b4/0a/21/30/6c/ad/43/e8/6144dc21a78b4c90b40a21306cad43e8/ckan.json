    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan\n                              satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation\n                              and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully\n                              launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space\n                              Center in Japan.\n                              \n                              The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) is a five-channel\n                              visible/infrared radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the\n                              Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown\n                              aboard the NOAA series of Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental\n                              Satellites (POES). The VIRS detects radiation at 1 visible, 2 near\n                              infrared and 2 thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing determination of\n                              cloud coverage, cloud top height and temperature, and precipitation\n                              indices. The central wavelengths for the VIRS channels are 0.63, 1.60,\n                              3.75, 10.8, and 12.0 microns. All channels are in operation during the\n                              daytime, but only channels 3, 4 and 5 operate during the nighttime.\n                              \n                              The Level 1A product file (1A01) is a concatenation of the Level 0\n                              data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The\n                              header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit\n                              number, times of the first scan, and number of scans, among other\n                              things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as\n                              \"sensor counts\". A Level 1A file contains data for a single orbit and\n                              has a file size of about 31 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files\n                              of VIRS 1A01 data produced per day.\n                              \n                              Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South\n                              owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit\n                              provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to\n                              be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis\n                              of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.",
