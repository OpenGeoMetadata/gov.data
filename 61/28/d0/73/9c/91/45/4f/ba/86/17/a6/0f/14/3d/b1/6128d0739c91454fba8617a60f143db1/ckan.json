    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Hazardous Waste Site Polygon Data with CIESIN Modifications, Version 2 is a database providing georeferenced \n\ndata for 1,572 National Priorities List (NPL) Superfund sites. These were selected from the larger set of the ATSDR Hazardous Waste Site Polygon Data, Version 2 data set with polygons from \n\nMay 26, 2010. The modified data set contains only sites that have been proposed, currently on, or deleted from the final NPL as of October 25, 2013. Of the 2,080 ATSDR polygons from 2010, \n\n1,575 were NPL sites but three sites were excluded - 2 in the Virgin Islands and 1 in Guam. This data set is modified by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science \n\nInformation Network (CIESIN). The modified polygon database includes all the attributes for these NPL sites provided in the ATSDR GRASP Hazardous Waste Site Polygon database and selected \n\nattributes from the EPA List 9 Active CERCLIS sites and SCAP 12 NPL sites databases. These polygons represent sites considered for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund). The Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP, Division of Health Studies, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \n\nRegistry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has created site boundary data using the best available information for those sites where health assessments or consultations have been \n\nrequested.",
