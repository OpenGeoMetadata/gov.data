  "notes": "In May of 2006, scientists from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center\nparticipated in a pilot outreach program in Sand Point, Alaska.  At the meetings,\nfishermen raised a number of concerns about the adequacy of walleye pollock\n(Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. The issues appeared to be related to the contrasting\nobservational scales of fishermen and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) scientists\nresponsible for conducting assessment surveys and population modeling. NMFS resource\nassessment surveys have a large spatial scale (i.e., the entire Gulf of Alaska) and occur\ninfrequently as they are biennial summer bottom trawl and acoustic-trawl surveys, with annual\nor biennial winter acoustic-trawl surveys targeting key spawning\nareas(von Szalay, et al. 2010; Guttormsen and Yasenak, 2007; Guttormsen and Jones, 2010).\nThe stock assessment model for pollock estimates stock abundance for the central and western\nGulf of Alaska (Dorn et al., 2011). In contrast, the observational scale of fishermen is spatially\nrestricted but temporally extensive, since they are on the water fishing throughout the year.\nFishermen questioned whether NMFS assessment activities were appropriately designed\nto monitor the status of pollock in their area. They noted that additional surveys\nin different seasons and a more comprehensive acoustic-trawl survey effort in winter\ncould help address seasonal issues such as movement between spawning and feeding areas.\nCooperative research projects with the Sand Point fishing community were identified\nas a potential approach for addressing some of these issues, but fishermen wanted\nthe assurance that their investment of time and effort will lead to improvements\nin stock assessment. The acoustic-trawl surveys described in this report resulted\nfrom collaboration between NMFS scientists, the Aleutian East Borough, and local\nfishermen to address issues raised during the outreach program.  Acoustic-trawl\nsurveys were conducted from a local fishing vessel in the western Gulf of Alaska\nduring 2007-2013.  To some extent, the surveys carried out during this period reflected\nshifting program objectives.  The initial objective was simply to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of using local fishing vessels to conduct acoustic-trawl surveys and\nto collect acoustic and biological information sufficient to estimate walleye pollock\nbiomass and spatial pattern.  Once this was demonstrated, the focus of the project expanded\nto include other objectives. Specific objectives of the project\nwere the following:\nEvaluate the feasibility of conducting acoustic-trawl surveys\nof pollock using local fishing vessels.\nEvaluate the quality of acoustic data collected from the Simrad ES60 echosounder.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of the design of the current NMFS acoustic-trawl surveys\nin the western Gulf of Alaska. Specific issues to be addressed included 1) transect density\nin bathymetrically complex regions in the western Gulf of Alaska, 2) day/night differences\nin pollock density, and 3) temporal variability of pollock density during replicate transects.\nEvaluate the timing of the NMFS survey (mid-February) in Sanak Trough\nby conducting a survey in January prior to the NMFS survey.\nEvaluate relationships between adult pollock density, young-of-the-year pollock density,\neuphausiid density, and the distribution of foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).\n\nThe estimates of abundance and distribution of walleye pollock were developed for\nareas covered by cooperative acoustic-trawl surveys conducted aboard a fishing vessel\n\nduring alternate Septembers and Januarys between 2007-2013.  Physical oceanographic \nand biological composition observations, initial findings from ancillary data collections \nof marine mammal observations, and dual-frequency differencing techniques to discriminate \ndifferent types of acoustic backscatter were also developed.",
