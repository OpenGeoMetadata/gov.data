    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This proposal describes the development of passive wireless surface\nacoustic wave (SAW) RFID sensor-tags with enhanced range for remote\nmonitoring of large groups of conventional sensors.  Passive wireless\nsensing tags using SAW technology have been demonstrated by Robert\nBrocato at Sandia National Labs and others.  These sensor-tags consist\nof a SAW device with an antenna attached to one port and sensor(s) and\nreference impedance(s) connected to the other ports.  RF signals are\nreflected off of the surface wave device, and their reflection\ncharacteristics are modified by changes in the impedance of the attached\nsensor(s).  This proposal describes development of novel passive\nwireless SAW sensor tags that combine radio frequency identification\n(RFID) coding with dispersive and low-loss SAW transducers and\nreflectors.  The proposed devices utilize RFID reflective delay line\ncoding techniques to produce devices capable of data densities over 32\nbits, enabling production of large codesets.  Variations in the\nreflected RFID code are used to identify the device and to provide a\nmeasure of the attached sensor(s), along with any internal sensing\nfunction(s).   The use of dispersive low-loss transducers and reflectors\nprovides increased processing gain and over 10 times the range of\nconventional SAW RFID tags.  The proposed sensor devices also operate in\na manner that is inherently immune to RF backscatter signals, further\nenhancing S/N.  Successful completion of the proposed Phase I activities\nwill establish the technical feasibility of these sensor-tags, will\nevaluate their performance in the laboratory when used with at least two\nexternal sensor devices, and will provide performance projections for\nuse with other sensors.  At the end of Phase I, devices will be at TRL\n4.  Phase II will result in development of multiple uniquely\nidentifiable passive sensor-tags and interrogation systems operable to\nwirelessly monitor sensors of interest to specific NASA programs (TRL6).",
