  "notes": "Lands with a State-owned conservation easement interest mapped to the PLS forty and government lot level. Easements in this layer have been determined to meet the statutory definition of Conservation Easement under M.S. Chapter 84C. In most cases, the land is generally a fee interest held by someone other than the State. There are some easement interests, however, that are on lnads that have a fee interest held by the State. This layer merges the IBM mainframe-based land records with the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer (often called PLS40). The data are limited to a PLS forty or government lot level of resolution. Therefore, ownership that is less than a forty or government lot in extent is represented as an entire forty or government lot in this dataset. Fields in the attribute table allow the user to identify any ownership that is less than the entire forty or government lot. During the creation process, all of the land records are matched to PLS40 and stored in one layer. For use, this layer was separated into several layers, using the type of interest, in this case conservation easement, and the type of easement. All of the conservation easements, no matter the administrator, are found in this layer.",
