    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Increasing demand for improved reliability and survivability of mission-critical systems is driving the\r\ndevelopment of health monitoring and Automated Contingency Management (ACM) systems. An ACM system is expected to adapt autonomously to fault conditions with the goal of still\r\nachieving mission objectives by allowing some degradation in system performance within permissible limits. ACM performance depends on supporting technologies like sensors\r\nand anomaly detection, diagnostic/prognostic and reasoning algorithms. This paper presents the development of a generic prototype test bench software framework for developing and\r\nvalidating ACM systems for advanced propulsion systems called the Propulsion ACM (PACM) Test Bench. The\r\narchitecture has been implemented for a Monopropellant Propulsion System (MPS) to demonstrate the validity of the approach. A Simulink model of the MPS has been developed\r\nalong with a fault injection module. It has been shown that the ACM system is capable of mitigating the failures by searching for an optimal strategy. Furthermore, few relevant\r\nexperiments have been presented to show proof of concepts.",
