    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Traditionally spaceflight life science experiments require the return of samples to earth for analysis, which is frequently a challenge to the success of investigations. Even with more analytical instruments on ISS, conditions do not facilitate the transfer of liquid samples from experimental devices to analytical devices. In response to the science community's call for on-orbit analyses, Techshot, Inc. proposes to develop an On-orbit Analytical Cassette (OAC) for life and microgravity sciences research, which provides an innovative way to leverage Techshot's ADSEP payload, which is considered by NASA to be part of the existing ISS facilities. The proposed innovation consists of properly contained access ports for the OAC, making it possible to remove a small aliquot of liquid sample from an OAC and transfer it to Techshot's Dynamic Stage for microscopic observations and analysis using the Light Microscopy Module.  The OAC is precisely on target to meet NASA's specific objective of (1) providing innovative ways to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads, and (2) providing on orbit analysis to enhance capabilities and reduce sample return requirements. Techshot's innovative OAC is destined to improve the throughput of ISS, making it a win-win for both NASA and the science community.",
