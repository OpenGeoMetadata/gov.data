    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We propose to develop and optimize 0.5 cm thick Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors with very small pixel pitches, i.e. 350 micron and 600 micron. The proposed innovative R&amp;D program is highly relevant for the EXIST  (Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope) mission, the leading candidate for NASA's black hole finder probe. The new EXIST reference design from the recent Advanced Mission Concept Study uses CZT detectors with a pixel pitch of 600 micron. The proposed work focuses on the optimization of the design of the pixel patterns (pad and gap widths), steering grids, guard rings, and bias rings. For the different designs, the detection efficiencies, energy resolutions, charge sharing properties, and minimum achievable energy thresholds will be evaluated. Dedicated measurements with collimated X-ray beams will be performed to evaluate the accuracy with which the depth of the interaction can be reconstructed based on different methods. Measurements with polarized X-ray beams will be used to put estimates of the X-ray polarization sensitivity of EXIST on a solid footing. Last but not least, the experimental results will be used to fine-tune a 3-D model of the detector response. The proposed R&amp;D is exciting and new in that very thick detectors with very small pixel pitches will be studied for the first time in detail. Effects like charge carrier diffusion and charge carrier repulsion are relatively more important for such detectors than for thinner detectors and/or detectors with larger pixel pitches.\n",
