    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The OMI-Aura level-2G daily global gridded (0.25x0.25 deg) near-UV Aerosol data product OMAERUVG based on the enhanced algorithm is available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaeruvg_v003.shtml \n      \n(The shortname for this Level-2G Global Gridded near-UV Aerosol Product is OMAERUVG_V003)             \n\nThis Level-2G daily global gridded product OMAERUVG is based on the pixel level OMI Level-2 Aerosol product OMAERUV. The OMAERUV product is based on the enhanced TOMS version-8 algorithm that essentially uses the ultraviolet radiance data. OMI provides two aerosol products OMAERUV and OMAERO at the pixel resolution (13 x 24 km at nadir) that are based on two different algorithms.\n      \nOMAERUVG data product is a special Level-2 gridded product where pixel level products are binned into 0.25x0.25 degree global grids. It contains the data for all scenes that have observation time betweeen UTC times of 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.9999 . All data pixels that fall in a grid box are saved without averaging. Scientist can apply data filtering scheme of their choice and create new gridded products. The GES DISC developed interactive tool Giovanni (http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) provides web based capabilities to browse and explore these data.\n      \nThe OMAERUVG data product contains almost all parameters that are contained in OMAERUV. For example, in addition to the extinction and absorption optical depth it also contains effective Lambertian scene-reflectivity, UV aerosol index,  cloud fraction, cloud pressure, ozone below clouds, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and extensive quality flags.\n      \nOMAERUVG files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains daily data from approximately 15 orbits mapped on the Global 0.25x0.25 deg Grids. The maximum file size for the OMERUVG data product is about 50 Mbytes.",
