  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Photometrics Laboratory provides the capability to measure, analyze and characterize radiometric and photometric properties of light sources and filters, as well as the capability to design, evaluate and support all shipboard lighting systems used in the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) platforms such as aircraft carriers, air capable ships and Expeditionary Airfields (EAFs).  Function:  The Photometrics Laboratory, located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ is a 200-foot-long-by-25-foot-wide, light-tight dark tunnel used for taking photometric and radiometric measurements and to make 3D models of the luminaire.  Capabilities:  Through the use of highly specialized, sophisticated instrumentation, the Photometrics Lab is able to provide measurements, analysis and product development for new light technologies, LEDs, lasers and Night Vision Devices (NVDs). One instrument used by the lab is a computer controlled goniometer with a full 360-degree azimuth rotation and 90-degree elevation rotation integrated with LabVIEW for data acquisition. The Photometrics Lab also functions to provide a variety of capabilities which include: requirement definitions; radiometric, photometric, photoelectric, spectral and temporal testing; ALRE light system development; installation of shipboard NVD compatible lighting and filters; and complete data analysis for all measurements to name a few.
