  "notes": " FUNCTION: The Laboratory for Large Data Research (LDR) addresses a critical need to rapidly prototype shared, unified access to large amounts of data across both the local and the wide area. LDR focuses on developing a global &amp;quot;large data&amp;quot; (LD) cloud along with communications pipes to rapidly access and produce knowledge from the best information available fused from federated, distributed, real-time sensors and archived digital media assets. The LDR utilizes open source agent technology to ingest, store, access, process, fuse, display, and distribute traceback and reachback information over unconstrained lightpaths in real time between producers and consumers without regard to location. DESCRIPTION: The LDR uses a proven &amp;quot; rapid prototype&amp;quot; process model to deploy, stress, debug, and quickly transition data-driven information technology to meet the global operational needs of DoD and the intelligence community. In virtually every data processing domain today, the volumes of data being captured, manipulated, stored, transported, and displayed are increasing superlinearly. Global access to timely information is a key enabler. The LDR goal is to provide coherent virtualization of enterprise services over terabit flows by developing advanced applications and prototypes that cannot be sustained by traditional technology infrastructures. Warehouse-sized facilities and workloads are likely to be common for near-real-time access of operational data across the global AOR, necessitating InfiniBand enable grids, clusters, farms, swarms, manycore processors, 100G networks, exabyte federated and distributed online data storage clouds, and object-based global file systems. INSTRUMENTATION: The LDR is equipped with leading-edge, high-performance, shared and distributed memory processing assets, application-specific servers, massive storage arrays, and visualization systems interconnected seamlessly. Multicore supercomputers and manycore FPGA-enhanced systems and software capture complete transactional or streamed performance and net-ops information, and monitor information assurance end-to-end on a per flow basis. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a LDR control plane for authorization and resource access, management of peer-to-peer transactions, end-to-end quality of service guarantees, multi-level precedence and pre-emption, and protocol stack optimization in support of open source service-oriented architectures.
