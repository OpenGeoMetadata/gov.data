    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Currently, characterization of constituent-level failure in state-of-the-art FRP composites is limited to two-dimensional observations (e.g. using optical or scanning-electron microscopy) often using post-mortem, destructive methods. Additionally, simulation of FRP deformation and failure at the constituent-level has been either homogenized or two-dimensionalized due to the perceived computational resources needed to perform three-dimensional finite-element (FE) analyses. In contrast, for metallic alloys, recent advances in high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and supercomputing have enabled detailed characterization and simulation of deformation and failure at the grain-level scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For FRP composites, volumetric imaging and numerical modeling of the constituent-level microstructure provides a unique set of challenges. For instance, in order to resolve accurately the shape and location of individual constituents (e.g. fibers), volumetric imaging must be performed at a sub-micron resolution. To date, a number of researchers have reported imaging FRPs using micro-focus or synchrotron source radiation X-ray CT; however, these techniques are currently limited to a 1-2 um resolution. Additionally, in order to simulate accurately the deformation and failure of FRP composites within a numerical framework, thousands of individual, randomly distributed fibers and the surrounding resin must be represented within a single three-dimensional model. Development and implementation of these models will require tremendous computational power, and their performance will be evaluated using novel, constituent-level characterization and validation experiments. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey of commercially available reconstruction codes highlighted the need for development of new software intended specifically for FRP composites. The new software will be based on novel pattern-recognition algorithms to extract two-dimensional spatial distribution of individual constituents, and will utilize multi-particle tracking algorithms to determine their shape in the third dimension. When completed, the new software will automatically generate realistic FE models based on real CT-derived data; or alternatively, the software will collect and generate extensive statistical information to create synthetic counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of the realistic or synthetic FE models will be evaluated with 4D in-situ constituent-level characterization and validation experiments. These experiments will be integrated with the X-ray CT microscope chamber and will enable remote sensing of the applied load or displacement, with a concurrent unobstructed rotation of the test specimen necessary for tomographic imaging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
