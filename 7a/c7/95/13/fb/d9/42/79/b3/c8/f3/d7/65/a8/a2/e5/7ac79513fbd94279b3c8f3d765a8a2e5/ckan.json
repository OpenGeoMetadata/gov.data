    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This paper describes how damage propagation can be tracked and modeled for a range of fault modes in some modules of commercial high bypass aircraft engines. To that end, response surfaces of all sensors are generated via a thermo-dynamical simulation model for the engine (cycle deck) as a function of variations of flow and efficiency of the modules of interest. These surfaces are normalized and superimposed. Next, sensor readings are matched to those surfaces and – using an optimization approach – the corresponding flow and efficiency pair is found that best explains the sensor data. This flow and efficiency pair is then compared to previous pairs and the direction of the change as well as the rate of change is determined. The whole trajectory is then projected into the time domain. An extrapolation of the curve to the limit (which is established via operational margins) yields the remaining life. In a backward mode, the extrapolated curve is discretized and estimated future flow and efficiency pairs are retrieved. These pairs are then input to the cycle deck to produce future anticipated sensor readings as well as confirmatory trips of operational margins. Changes of the future sensor readings with real readings are used to adjust the remaining life calculations. The method is demonstrated on time series of historical engine faults.",
