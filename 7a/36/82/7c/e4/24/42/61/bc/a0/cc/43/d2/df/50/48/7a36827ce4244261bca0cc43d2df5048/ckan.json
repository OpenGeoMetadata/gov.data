    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThere is a valid scientific data paradigm where no loss of data can be tolerated.  However, transmission of raw data requires unacceptable bandwidth and storage resources such that the net data received is uncomfortably low.  Lossless data compression can be used to preserve all data with no information loss and also help meet bandwidth and storage constraints.  The current Universal Source Encoder of Space (USES) has been meeting many lossless compression needs for a decade.  However, USES is not able to successfully address higher speed instruments, beyond 20 MSamples/sec, or function at quantization levels higher than 15 bits.  The proposed work provides a new solution and presents a lossless data solution that should be valid for at least a decade or more. \r\n\r\nA radiation tolerant high performance (100M Samples/second) 32-bit lossless custom processor will be delivered in the proposed work which meets the CCSDS 121-0-B 1 recommendation.  The processor will be implemented in a radiation tolerant 0.25 micron CMOS process which realizes a proven algorithm developed at GSFC and implemented in a 15-bit version 10 years ago.  The new compressor is 5 times faster and has twice the input quantization range, suitable for modern spacecraft requirements.   The net-list (design) of the processor can be used to synthesize a future 200 Msamples/sec plus data rates when a sub-100 nm radiation tolerant fabrication process is available.  \r\n",
