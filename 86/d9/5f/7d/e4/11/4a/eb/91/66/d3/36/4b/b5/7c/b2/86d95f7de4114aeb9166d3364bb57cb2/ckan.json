    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Spacecraft generate huge amounts of data.  A significant challenge for\r\nboth human operators and autonomous control systems is ensuring that\r\nthe right data (and combinations of data) are available at the right\r\ntime for control and decision-making and ensuring that the data is at\r\nthe right abstraction level.  A key part of this process is data\r\nabstraction -- that is converting low-level analog or digital signals\r\ninto higher-level data.  We are proposing a data abstraction\r\narchitecture that provides a provides a tool-box of components,\r\nconnections and development environment that allow engineers to build\r\nand maintain data abstraction systems.  In addition, having a\r\nwell-defined data abstraction architecture allows data displays to be\r\nautomatically generated and updated as the architecture develops.\r\nThus, a data abstraction architecture can support both human\r\ndecision-making as well as providing data services to autonomous\r\ncontrol systems.  We are also proposing to build an integrated\r\ndevelopment environment in which designers or operators can\r\ngraphically build data abstraction architectures from standard\r\ncomponents to accomplish their data tasks.  Together these provide a\r\ndata abstraction architecture that is a key component of NASA's\r\noperational infrastructure and provides a building block for deploying\r\nmore advanced autonomy architectures in the future.
