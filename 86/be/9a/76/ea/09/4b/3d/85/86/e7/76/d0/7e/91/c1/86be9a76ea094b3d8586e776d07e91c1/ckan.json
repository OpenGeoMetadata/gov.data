    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The objective of this Phase I SBIR program is to develop polymer derived rare earth silicate nanocomposite environmental barrier coatings (EBC) for providing next-generation corrosion resistance and thermal insulation to Aerojet's Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems.  The NTP environmental barrier coatings will be developed from NanoSonic's innovate inorganic polymeric nanocomposite resins that crosslink to dimensionally stable gels under ambient conditions and gracefully transition to high temperature corrosion and thermally insulative resistant coatings at elevated temperatures.  Through a synergism of nanoparticle &amp;#150; rare earth silicate load transfer pathways, NanoSonic's proposed EBC topcoat technology will readily absorb and dissipate high velocity impact threats while providing exceptional thermal shock resistance necessary for enhanced survivability of nickel-chromium based alloys within current and future NTP rocket engine rocket thrust chambers and nozzles.  Working with team members Aerojet and the University of Washington, NanoSonic will molecularly engineer a family of rare earth silicate polymeric precursors that are specifically optimized for rocket engines within Aerojet's NTP space technology program.  \r\n\r\nFor the proposed effort, NanoSonic, the University of Washington and Aerojet have created an SBIR research team to rapidly identify, optimize and transition next-generation polymer derived rare earth silicate coatings specifically optimized to extend the operational utility of NTP rocket thrust chambers and nozzles.  Within this teaming partnership, NanoSonic will continuously synthesize and optimize rare earth polymeric precursor coatings whereas the University of Washington will test coated nickel-chromium based alloys within flow conditions simulating NTP rocket exhaust. ANSYS thermal modeling will be employed to interpret and jointly optimize promising rare earth silicate coatings with Aerojet.",
