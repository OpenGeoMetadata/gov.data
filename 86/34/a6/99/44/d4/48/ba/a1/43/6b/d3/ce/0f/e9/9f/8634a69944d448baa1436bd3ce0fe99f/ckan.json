    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The major components of manmade aerosols are created by the burning of coal and oil.  Aerosols are recognized to significantly impact the climate through their effects on solar and terrestrial radiation.  Accurate speciation and measurement of aerosol composition is an important first step in understanding and managing these pollutants. This Phase II proposal continues development of a small, portable, detection system specifically for the collection, speciation and identification of gas phase and aerosolized organics. This Mini Gas Chromatograph collects samples and operates without the need for compressed-bottled gas by using Seacoast's proprietary chemicapacitive sensor array and commercial sensors with a preconcentration/chromatography system, combining selectivity from a diverse sensor array with a miniature sampling system for amplified sensitivity. Specific components are: 1) sample preconcentrator/collector capable of being heated quickly, 2) capillary column to separate the chemicals released from the preconcentrator and provide selectivity, 3) the chemical sensor array containing Seacoast's chemoselective microcapacitors and metal-oxide-based detectors, 4) integrated user interface. In Phase I Seacoast demonstrated that the system is capable of analyzing gas-phase and aerosolized volatile organics. In Phase II we propose to further develop the system's capabilities with a focus on improving sensitivity and collection efficiency.  ",
