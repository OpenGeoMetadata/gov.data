    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Determining the probability of specific medical events on a given space mission is difficult.  Yet, it is important to have reasonable estimates of these probabilities in order to make informed decisions about managing the associated risks.  NASA's mission is and always will be to push the envelope, to go where no historical record exists to give guidance.  Consequently, it is necessary to consider additional sources of information, like expert opinion, analog studies, and controlled studies.  To combine this information in a principled way, each source should be documented and should be characterized according to its \"level of evidence.\" NASA's researchers need the capability to gather information about each possible event, calculate the probability, update the calculations as new information is discovered, and support informed decisions about risks and risk mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nS&amp;K Aerospace (SKA) proposes an innovative Web-based system  to collect relevant evidence for medical events and facilitate the assignment of its \"level of evidence\", and combine evidence from multiple sources so that principled decisions can be reached concerning the probability of those events.  We intend to provide users with the ability to adjust the weighted combinations of multiple sources in order to refine the combined estimates, based on the expert opinion of the user of the software system. This system, which we call the Medical Event Decision Support System, or MEDSS, will allow researchers to create a database of possible medical events that require analysis.  For each event, information and references can be added; this information can take any form. In addition, we will build an inference engine that can calculate the probability of the event occurring, based on the information that is available. Each event will have a range of hypothetical mitigation strategies, along with the current best recommendation. ",
