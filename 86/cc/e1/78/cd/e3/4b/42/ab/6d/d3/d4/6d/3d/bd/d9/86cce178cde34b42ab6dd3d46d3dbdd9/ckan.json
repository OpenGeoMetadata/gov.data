  "notes": " The VEA Research SIL (VRS) is essential to the success of the TARDEC 30-Year Strategy. The vast majority of the TARDEC Capability Sets face challenging electronics integration issues. The VRS addresses these issues by designing, developing and implementing an advanced ground vehicle power and data network architecture along with the corresponding system designs when needed. When complete, the VRS will position TARDEC as the go-to resource for ground vehicle electronics architecture design, power architecture design and electronic/electrical engineering expertise. It will provide the ability for TARDEC to support PEO/PM modernization efforts, and build the human capital expertise in this area. The VRS develops and demonstrates an implementation of a complete VEA reference architecture to address the power, vetronics and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) integration challenges facing the modernization of the ground vehicle domain. The VRS also supports experimentation with future architectural concepts and implementation. This centralizes the Army&amp;#39;s approach to integrating electronics on ground vehicles, saving cost and reducing redundant work across multiple programs. This effort also includes power management technologies.  Capabilities: The VRS showcases a reference implementation of advanced architectural concepts, including high-voltage standards. The VRS has a Defense Research and Engineering Network connection to the C4ISR SIL at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, allowing both simulation and stimulus of representative external network components that could be integrated into a ground vehicle.  Benefits:  &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Provides SIL environment where contractors and vendors can bring electronic equipment to be integrated. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Provides &amp;quot;proving ground&amp;quot; for future architectural concepts. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; Provides connectivity and insight into next-generation Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center C4ISR systems.
