    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Diamond Data Systems (DDS) proposes the development of a new, advanced\narchitecture, algorithms and software to support the end-to-end\nprocessing of LIDAR data to derive a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).  Our\napproach is innovative in three ways.  First, we propose a complete\nend-to-end system instead of a solution that addresses only a single\nstep of the complex problem of accurately gathering, processing, and\nreporting of the data.   Secondly, we propose a system that is designed\nto minimize human interaction and manual data entry.  Thirdly, and\npossibly the most important part of this innovation, is that we propose\nboth the implementation of multiple algorithms to perform the data\nprocessing, as well as an extensible software architecture which allows\nnew algorithms to be incorporated into the system in the future.  This\napproach allows for the development of a dynamic system which can be\nextended in the future as better algorithms are developed.  Our proposal\nis relevant to topic E3.03 in that it provides for the efficient\nproduction of a DEM product from an active imaging system (LIDAR).\nCurrent approaches to this problem only solve parts of the problem and\ndo not provide an integrated system for end-to-end processing.",
