    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Successes to date with the use of integrated software framework tools have led NASA engineers and other researchers to expand the breadth, depth, and sophistication of the problems that they are attempting to solve. Both the utilization of \"high-fidelity\" physics based models (\"depth\") and the total number of different engineering disciplines included in system models (\"breadth\") have steadily increased. As model size and complexity grows, the number of engineers involved in the development and maintenance of these models is also increasing. Increases in system model size and complexity and the corresponding need for collaborative model development are beginning to stretch the limits of existing software frameworks. Large models are more difficult to build and maintain, while the inclusion of more people in the development process leads to model management and coordination issues. Enhanced and improved framework tools are required if NASA and industry are to continue to expand their modeling, simulation, and design capabilities. In this project, Phoenix Integration will develop an innovative software environment that will allow individual engineers and collaborative engineering teams to better build and manage large, complex, system models. Key elements in the solution include a new infrastructure for hierarchical model building (models within models), enhanced data linking and model verification tools, and an integrated version-controlled model and data library. These tools will combine to provide NASA engineers with a powerful and flexible environment for creating, maintaining, and collaborating on the creation, execution, and maintenance of large and complex system models.
