Collected data are used to generate emission factors for each munition tested    B-2 is a reinforced concrete structure with interior dimensions of approximately 74&amp;#39; wide by 70&amp;#39; deep by 36&amp;#39; high    The interior volume of the barricade is 184,820 ft 3    Capable of sustaining a 25-pound TNT equivalent detonation    The open end of the facility is sealed using a PVC strip-curtain. A steel blast shield, equipped with an opening and remotely operated external door, is located immediately in front of the strip curtain. Together the shield and curtain absorb the blast from the weapon&amp;#39;s firing and allow the projectile to exit the facility while retaining the gases for emissions characterization measurements    Six high-volume fans (9280 ft 3/min each) located around the interior perimeter of the barricade, are used to homogenize the effluent to enable accurate, reproducible sampling and analysis    A separate instrumentation and test control building is part of the facility. Instrumentation and weapon firing are controlled remotely from this location. Instrumentation and equipment are in place to provide thermal, pressure, projectile velocity, emission product sampling and real time gas measurements, high speed video and photographic data    Supported by advanced analytical instrumentation, data collection and on site chemistry lab facilities at ATC and U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM)    ATC utilizes sampling and analysis methodologies reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Environmental Center and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  "
