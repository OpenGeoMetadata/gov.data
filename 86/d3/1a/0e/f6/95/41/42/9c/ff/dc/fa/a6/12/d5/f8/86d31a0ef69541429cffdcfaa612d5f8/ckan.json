    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides soil physical and chemical properties, and grass nutrient measurements of samples collected from 17 pasture sites located within the state of Rondonia in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Soil data includes bulk density, class, texture, and measurements of carbon (C), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (mg), and potassium (K) concentrations.  Foliar data includes nitrogen (N), P, Ca, Mg, and K concentrations.The 17 pasture sites were cattle ranches selected within the region between Porto Velho and Presidente Medici of Rondonia. Four of the ranches with Ultisols support dairy cattle, and the rest have beef cattle pastures dispersed across three soil orders: Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols.  Nearby primary forest sites were also sampled to provide data on the original soil properties for each soil order. Soil samples were collected in May 2003, July through August 2003, and May 2004, which covered the late rainy season (May) and the dry season (July through August). Grass species sampled included Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria decumbens, B. brizantha, and Pennestum clandestinum, and represented three phenologically distinct grass materials: wet-season live grass, collected in May 2004, dry-season live grass and dry-season senesced grass, both collected between the end of July and the beginning of August 2003. There are 4 comma-delimited data files with this data set.",
