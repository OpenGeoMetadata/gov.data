    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "We design and demonstrate the feasibility of extending the open source Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) to support the full range of capabilities now available to Java developers but for Fortran. We have experience in this process from having done analogous SBIR work for the Ada language with the Navy and Missile Defense Agency. As was the case for Ada, there is an existing but insufficient plug in for Fortran now available for Eclipse, namely Photran. We will leverage Harmonia's past work on Rise plug-in for Ada, c, C++ to create product that builds on Eclipse Photran as well as pFUnit and FUnit.\r\n\r\nFacilities we will implement include annotating source code as an overlay to the existing code, so that developers learning about the code are free to mark it up without affecting the original code, and creating various views tracing execution, showing potential concurrency, etc. We also integrate unit testing, graphical editing of workflows to create scripts that are used with Fortran, support the analysis and porting of Fortran code to different target architectures, and provide a web service link to accommodate cases where the Fortran compiler runs on a different machine from the IDE. Our goal is a 25&#37; productivity improvement.\r\n",
