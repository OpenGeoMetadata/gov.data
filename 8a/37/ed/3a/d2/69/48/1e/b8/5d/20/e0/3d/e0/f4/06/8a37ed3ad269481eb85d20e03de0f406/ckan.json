  "notes": "This data set contains imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and is comprised of scanned photographs that were acquired on color positive film. NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The source files are 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP). The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county. MrSID compression, with mosaic option, was used. (Note: The Land Management Information Center has created this metadata record to describe the entire NAIP2003-04 dataset, using information from Farm Service Agency metadata provided in 2003 and 2004. Each county file is accompanied by the original FSA metadata for that county.)",
