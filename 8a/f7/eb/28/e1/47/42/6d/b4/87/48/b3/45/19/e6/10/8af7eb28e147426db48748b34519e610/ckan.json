  "notes": " The U. S. Navy dedicated the decommissioned Spruance Class destroyer ex-PAUL F. FOSTER (EDD 964), Test Ship, primarily for at sea demonstration of short range weapon systems and other surface combat and weapon system projects. In addition to Combat &amp;amp; Weapons system Test &amp;amp; Evaluation, the Test Ship supports multiple types and all levels of engineering, testing and evaluation aspects of Naval systems including:  Floating laboratory for design investigation, training, and logistics product proofing Distance support development Advanced technology demos Target Evaluation Hull, Mechanical, and electrical initiatives In-Service Engineering agent (ISEA) investigations The Test Ship provides the Navy with an at-sea weapons test and evaluation platform that can be manned when appropriate and, by design, has the unique capability of being operated in remote control to support live-fire test operations to fully evaluate the complete detect-control-engage sequence. Test Ship operations are conducted from facilities at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme (NSWC PHD) and Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division at Point Mugu within the Sea Test Range. The Test Ship implements radio frequency connectivity coupled with fiber optic technology to provide remote controlled combat system and ship navigation capabilities to support a variety of unmanned test events. This capability allows for the conduct of very close in engagements by self defense weapons systems of real-world targets. Targets can fly attack profiles in a realistic at sea environment without risk to personnel. The combat/weapon system and navigation control is performed from the Surface Warfare Engineering Facility (SWEF) at NSWC PHD.  ",
