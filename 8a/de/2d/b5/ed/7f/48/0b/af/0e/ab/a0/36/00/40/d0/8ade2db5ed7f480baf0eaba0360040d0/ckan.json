    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was launched aboard the EOS-Aura  satellite on July 15, 2004 (1:38 pm equator crossing time, ascending  mode). OMI with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal  investigator (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal  Netherlands Meteorological Institute). OMI is designed to monitor  stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from  biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic eruptions, and key tropospheric  pollutants (HCHO,NO2) and ozone depleting gases (OClO and BrO). OMI  sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all derived  geophysical atmospheric products will be archived at the NASA Goddard  DAAC. The Sulfer Dioxide Product 'OMSO2' from the Aura-OMI is now publicly  available from NASA GSFC Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information  Services Center (DISC) for public access.  OMSO2 product contains three values of SO2 Vertical column corresponding to three a-priori vertical profiles used in the  retrieval algorithm. It also contains quality flags, geolocation and other ancillary information.        The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column SO2 product is OMSO2 and the algorithm leads for this product are NASA/UMBC OMI scientists Drs. Nikolay Krotkov (nickolay.a.krotkov@nasa.gov),Kai Yang(kai.yang@nasa.gov) and Arlin J. Krueger(krueger@umbc.edu).       OMSO2 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMSO2 data product is about 21 Mbytes. On-line spatial and parameter subset options are available during data download A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml A short OMSO2 Readme Document that includes brief algorithm description and   documents that provides known data quality related issues are available from the UMBC OMI site ( http://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs.php )             For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ http://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov/ http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/.
