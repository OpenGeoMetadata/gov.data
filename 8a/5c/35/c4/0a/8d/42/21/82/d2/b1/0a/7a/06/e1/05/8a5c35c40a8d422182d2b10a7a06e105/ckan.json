    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA Ames Research Centerâ€™s Sustainability Base\r\nis a new 50,000 sq. ft. high-performance office building targeting\r\na LEED Platinum rating. Plug loads are expected to account for a\r\nsignificant portion of overall energy consumption because building\r\ndesign choices resulted in greatly reduced energy demand\r\nfrom Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and\r\nlighting systems, which are typically major contributors to energy\r\nconsumption in traditional buildings. This paper reports on a\r\npilot study where data from a variety of plug loads were collected\r\nin a reference office building to understand usage patterns,\r\nto make a preliminary assessment as to the effectiveness of\r\ncontrolling (i.e., turning off and on) selected loads, and to evaluate\r\nthe utility of the plug load management system chosen for the\r\nstudy. Findings indicate that choosing energy efficient equipment,\r\nensuring that power saving functionality is operating effectively,\r\npromoting beneficial occupant energy behavior, and employing\r\nplug load controls to turn off equipment when not in use can\r\nlead to significant energy savings. These recommendations will\r\nbe applied to Sustainability Base and further studies of plug\r\nload management systems and techniques to reduce plug energy\r\nconsumption will be pursued.",
