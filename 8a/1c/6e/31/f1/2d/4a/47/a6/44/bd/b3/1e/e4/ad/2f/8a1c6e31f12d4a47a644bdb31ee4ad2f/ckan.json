    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "X-ray measurements are critical for the understanding of cycles of matter and energy in the Universe, for understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and for probing gravity in the extreme limit of matter accretion onto a black hole. We propose a program to mature the current x-ray microcalorimeter technology, while developing transformational technology that will enable megapixel arrays.\n\nX-ray calorimeters based on superconducting transition-edge sensors achieve the highest energy resolution of any non-dispersive detector technology. The performance of single x-ray calorimeter pixels has reached that required for many possible future missions such as IXO, RAM, and Generation-X, but further optimization is still useful. In the last years, we have made progress in developing techniques to control and engineer the properties of the superconducting transition. We propose to continue this single-pixel optimization, and to improve both the practical and theoretical understanding of the correlation between alpha, beta, and noise to identify favorable regions of parameter space for different instruments.\n\nA greater challenge is the development of mature TES x-ray calorimeter arrays with a very large number of pixels. Advances in the last several years have been significant. We have developed modestly large (256 pixel) x-ray calorimeter arrays with time-division SQUID multiplexing, and demonstrated Walsh code-division SQUID multiplexing, which has the potential to allow scaling to much larger arrays. Here we propose to extend this work, and also to introduce a new code-division SQUID multiplexing circuit with extremely compact, low-power elements. Using this approach, it is possible for the first time to fit all of the detector biasing and multiplexing elements underneath an x-ray absorber, allowing in-focal-plane multiplexing. This approach eliminates the requirement to bring leads from each pixel out of the focal plane, while reducing the power dissipati",
