    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Planning and scheduling (P&amp;S) is an essential task for managing current and future NASA missions.  P&amp;S systems are used in many areas of spacecraft operations including science planning, flight dynamics operations, and space and ground network scheduling.  Typically, different tools are used by different users, possibly in different locations, for each of these functions because current tools are not suited to addressing all of a mission's P&amp;S needs.  There is thus an additional need to integrate the results of all these scheduling efforts, which increases mission cost, complexity, and risk.  To address these issues, Emergent Space Technologies (Emergent) is proposing to develop a prototype plug-and-play P&amp;S system that allows for heterogeneous, distributed scheduling of activities to occur simultaneously without conflict.  The unique qualities of the proposed P&amp;S system that will make it an innovative solution are the nature of how newly developed resources, tasks, and scheduling algorithms can easily be added to the system, how it will have an openly available and well-defined application programming interface (API) for developers to use, and how it will operate in a distributed environment as a resilient peer-to-peer architecture with no single points of failure.  With these innovations in place, P&amp;S implementations for flight dynamics, automation and autonomy, system monitoring, science planning, or any other activity can be developed and operated in remote locations and still be a fully-integrated solution.",
