    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe understanding of the line emission from heavy ions is still incomplete and often inaccurate, resulting in missing or incorrect line assignments and missing or incorrect flux. This limits the utility both of spectral predictions and of space-based equipment used for observing the solar spectrum. An example of this is the 195 &amp;Aring; channel of TRACE, which is centered on the FeXII line. Recent changes in the atomic data used to model the spectral emission near 195 &amp;Aring; have dramatically (up to an order of magnitude) changed the temperature response of this channel. A similar situation is likely to recur for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, which is to be launched as part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Here the responses of the six iron line channels, centered on lines from FeIX, FeXII, FeXIV, FeXVI, FeXVIII, FeXX, FeXXIII, and FeXXIV, sensitively depend on the correct position and strength of neighboring lines that fall within the instrumental response. Current predictions from various theoretical models describing the emission covered by these channels are in disagreement, and definitive experimental observations at the level of detail needed for establishing an authoritative model are nonexistent. Given the impending launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, which is a key mission in the Heliophysics Research Program, a resolution of the spectral modeling issues by definitive laboratory measurements is not only timely but urgently needed. Here we propose to conduct the definitive laboratory measurements required for calibrating the temperature response of the six AIA iron channels. Our work will provide highly accurate wavelength and intensity information of all relevant lines falling into the wavelength bands of the six Fe channels. This will provide the data for producing the high-confidence spectral modeling codes needed for use in calibrating the response of each iron line channel as well as for the successful evaluation and utilization of the observational data from the six AIA iron line channels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
