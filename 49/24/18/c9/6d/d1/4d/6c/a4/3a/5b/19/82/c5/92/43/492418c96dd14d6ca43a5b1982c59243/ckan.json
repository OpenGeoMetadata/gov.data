  "notes": " The purpose of the Crew Systems Integration Laboratory (CSIL) is to revolutionalize human-machine interface technologies to control, manage, and operate multiple heterogeneous unmanned air vehicles (UAV) with minimal crew size. AFRL uses a variety of laboratories and equipment to study all aspects of human-machine interaction applied to semi-autonomous and heterogeneous unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The goal is to afford all human operators every advantage in monitoring and controlling future weapon systems, which are growing increasingly autonomous with every new generation. The CSIL consists of the following:   A research center/theater room that provides advanced capabilities for collaborating with other agencies.   An innovation center with a variety of advanced immersive controls and displays.   A test and integration center supporting both UAS flight test integration and support and UAV hardware-in-the-loop testing.   A design and development center that provides state-of-the-art software development tool sets for rapid prototyping and integration with the Vifilant Spirit Control Station.   A Human Automation Lab for the development and evaluation of multiple dynamic levels of human engagement with autonomous system control. The lab sill facilitate the shared understanding of autonomous system goals and planning through the utilization of intuitive displays.   Since its inception, this laboratory has provided game changing capabilities to the Vigilant Spirit Control Station, as demonstrated during the 2007 and 2009 Talisman Saber exercises. The laboratory team was also awarded the 2008 Air Force and Air Force Materiel Command Outstanding Science Award.   ",
