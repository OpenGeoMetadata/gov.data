    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "High power solar arrays with capabilities of &gt;100kW are needed for projected NASA missions.  Photovoltaic arrays using deployable membranes with thin cells have trended to higher efficiency cells to minimize deployed area and deployment structure mass and complexity, however, the cost of high efficiency cells make these arrays prohibitively expensive.  Amorphous cells that are in production for terrestrial application have $/Watt cost less than 10&#37; of space cells, at about the half the efficiency.   This SBIR develops the Photovoltaic Assembly with Reconfigurable Array Structure - PARASol - a centripetal force deployment and tensioning approach that enables affordability of multi-100kW arrays with commercially available thin film CIGS cells, which can be adapted for space environment compatibility.  PARASol implements CIGS cell modules using Vanguard's THINS solar cell encapsulation technology to achieve high mass and stowed volume metrics (&gt;500W/kg, &gt;200kW/m3), and mount the CIGS-THINS modules onto a Membrane Solar Array (MSA) that can be rolled and folded into a compact envelope and deployed without cumbersome external deployment structure.  In phase I we will develop the design and structural analysis of a 250kW PARASol MSA, selecting from flower-, umbrella-, or origami-like deployments, and evaluate figures of merit for the array when implemented with a combination of centripetal force and elastic or shape-memory integral ribs to deploy and tension the array. We will evaluate the alternative gore sizes and shapes to determine the maximum PV packing factor we can achieve.  We will develop a plan for scaling up the technology and qualifying for space, addressing the key challenge of demonstrating and characterizing such a large array in ground-test with gravity off-loader.  The Phase I completes with a subscale demonstration using a scalable version of the test fixture, leading to a plan forward towards flight experiment in Phase II.",
