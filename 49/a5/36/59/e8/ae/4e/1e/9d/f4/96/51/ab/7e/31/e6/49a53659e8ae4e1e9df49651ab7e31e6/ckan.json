    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the viability of this technology, a prototype Natural User Interface (NUI) was developed as a proof-of-concept for system control.&amp;nbsp; Gesture and voice controls were developed and compared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Both methods of control input allowed the user to be in a general area as opposed to a specific location.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Voice input highlighted the ability to achieve truly hands-free interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototype provided for control of a simplistic lighting system and cabin temperature control system which represented a typical space habitat system requiring interaction.&amp;nbsp; The user interacted with the system through a Microsoft Kinect sensor which includes an infrared light source and receiver and array microphone capability.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Code was developed in conjunction with the skeleton tracking and speech recognition capabilities in the software development kit to allow the use of gestures and speech as a source of input.&amp;nbsp; To allow the user to monitor system response and to &amp;#39;see&amp;#39; the results of their commands, a simple set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to include the logical equivalent of commands and telemetry feedback.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition, an end effector unit was developed using an Arduino microprocessor which received serial port inputs from the application software to control light emitting diodes which represented habitat light systems and a servo motor which represented an air mixing valve that might be used to support temperature control setpoint.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To interact with the system, the user began with a main display where they could navigate to the lighting controls display and a thermal control display.&amp;nbsp; The lighting controls consisted of on-off buttons for three areas of the simulated habitat (lab, crew quarters, airlock). Using voice commanding, the user could control the lights in each habitation area (e.g., &amp;ldquo;lab off&amp;rdquo; would select the off button). Gesture control employed both the left and right arms. Once the participant told the system to track their arm, a focus box would move over the lighting controls as controlled by the left hand. Once the focus box was over the desired on-off control, the button would be activated by a wave of the right hand. On the thermal control screen, a slider was shown with setpoint values ranging from 62 and 82 degrees. Using simple voice commands such as &amp;ldquo;temp 70&amp;rdquo;, the setpoint indicator would move to that temperature. When the participant told the system to track the hand, the slider would move in parallel with the right hand. To stay at a specific temperature, the participant simply told the system to stop tracking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The appropriate lights on the end-effector unit would turn on/off consistent with the GUI indications and the servo would move to a position in its range of motion that was scaled to be consistent with the temperature setpoint command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development, test and evaluation of this small system emphasized the importance of designing it in a way that ensures the actions the system takes are consistent with the intent of the user and that the application software contains logic necessary to correctly interpret the sensed inputs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is particularly challenging to accomplish while trying to ensure that the gestures and voice commands remain natural and easily remembered/applied.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was also important to allow the user to enable/disable the processing of voice/gesture at any given time during use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this project we have identified the need to investigate and develop gesture and voice &amp;#39;vocabularies&amp;#39; that will be perceived as natural and easily remembered by users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have also determined that design approaches using mode control are relevant but require additional considerations when using one or more NUI input modalities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Progressively more complex system development would be the best approach to mature the design practices required for spacecraft application.&amp;nbsp; It is understood that other options exist for NUI input sensing which may be preferable for certain applications. &amp;nbsp; However, it is believed that this forward work&amp;nbsp; would apply to alternate NUI input sensing options as well.&lt;/p&gt;",
