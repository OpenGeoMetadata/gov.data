    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set contains five data files, in comma-separated format (.csv), derived from the Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) vegetation inventory in eastern Tennessee. Field studies of permanent vegetation plots were conducted using one sampling design over a 40-year period (1967 to 2006). The data set contains long-term measurements of diameter at breast height (DBH) determined on stratified randomly-located inventory plots within the 4 different vegetation types (oak-hickory, pine-oak-hickory, pine, and mesophytic hardwoods) located in the WBW in 1967. The WBW plot-level vegetation DBH data are provided in four files. One file contains the complete set of inventory records (139,806 observations). To accommodate spreadsheet use, the complete inventory is split into three files, one containing 52,110 observations and the other two containing 48,231 and 39,465 observations, respectively. The fifth file contains the WBW vegetation species inventory with species names, the numeric species code for each species, a species group designation, the scientific name for each species, and the literature-derived ratio of g lignin/g N for leaves of each species. NPP values have been reported for various forest stands at different locations within the WBW by Olson et al. (2012a, b; DeAngelis et al. (1997); and Esser (1998). Total NPP values range from 380 gC/m2/yr for forest stands dominated by yellow poplar to 790 gC/m2/yr for forest stands dominated by oaks. Revision Notes: This updated vegetation inventory data set includes results of the 2006 survey and updates to previous results based on the latest survey. The 1967-2006 data set completely supersedes the 1967-1997 data set. If you downloaded the 1967-1997 data set before September 3, 2013, you should download the 1967-2006 version at your earliest convenience.",
