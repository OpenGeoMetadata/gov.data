  "notes": "This ongoing project began in 1988. A total of 38 subsurface recording thermographs have been deployed in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and at other selected locations on the Florida Reef Tract and associated hydrologic ecosystems. These instruments were originally programmed to record at 2 hour intervals, and are placed in permanent housings attached to suitable substrate. Data retrieval, servicing and reprogramming for continuous deployment have occurred, on average, annually. The collected data are made available to FKNMS Managers and others who monitor and assess environmental conditions that influence FKNMS areas of the Florida Reef Tract. The most recent round of data from each station is available on web sites, while an archival copy of these, plus older data, are maintained and available from the US National Oceanic Data Center (NODC) web site.",
