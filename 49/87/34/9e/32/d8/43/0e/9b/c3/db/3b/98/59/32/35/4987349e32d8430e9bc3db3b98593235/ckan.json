  "notes": "The National Transportation Research Center (NTRC) was created to support industry and government agencies in the development of advanced vehicle technologies to reduce petroleum use and lower greenhouse gas emissions, performance of vehicle-infrastructure systems analysis to improve system efficiency and reduce congestion, and assist in technology deployment. In combustion and fuel-effects research, facilities include seven double-ended engine dynamometers ranging from 25 to 600 horsepower, multiple full-pass engine control systems; vehicle chassis dynamometer; analytical chemistry and catalysis laboratories; and novel diagnostic instrumentation developed at NTRC for specialized needs such as dynamic in situ chemical speciation in catalysts and engines. Unique in the DOE Lab system is the Vehicle Systems Laboratory, a full powertrain research cell large enough for Class 8 truck systems, including capabilities to emulate and research hybrid powertrains in many configurations. Power electronics and electric motor capabilities include power semiconductor device testing and characterization, power module and inverter packaging, converter and inverter topology development, control and simulation, semiconductor-based device fabrication facilities, and wide bandgap material and medium- and high-voltage device evaluation and characterization. Electric drive components are benchmarked for industry in this facility. The Battery Manufacturing Facility offers the ability to integrate any component into a complete battery and analyze how well it works and how it can be improved. The Facility has 65&nbsp;m2 (700 ft2) dry space with less than 0.5% relative humidity and can produce pouch cells of up to 66 &times; 99 &times; 12 mm and 7 ampere-hours, large enough to make market decisions yet small enough to affordably demonstrate the impact of innovative technologies. The Fuel Cell Laboratory at NTRC is aimed at supporting the development of fuel cell technology by analyzing fuel cell behavior under typical operating conditions.  ",
