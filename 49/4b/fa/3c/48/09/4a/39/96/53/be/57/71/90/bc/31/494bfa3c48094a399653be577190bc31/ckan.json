    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound is the only medical imaging modality on the International Space Station due to its size, power requirements and versatility in medical imaging.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, ultrasound is&amp;nbsp;a very operator dependent procedure and astronauts&amp;nbsp;do not have&amp;nbsp;time to train sufficiently before flight.Virtual Guidance, a type of just in time training, is a method to facilitate autonomous operation of medical ultrasound by untrained astronauts with an audio/video tutorial.&amp;nbsp; On the International Space Station, astronauts have to be guided through ultrasound studies by experts on the ground.&amp;nbsp; This method is called remote guidance, and&amp;nbsp;has been very successful with communication time delays of&amp;nbsp;2 seconds or less.&amp;nbsp; On missions further from earth, remote guidance will not be possible.&amp;nbsp; Virtual Guidance streams an audio video tutorial to the astronaut through video glasses actually while they are performing the ultrasound study.&amp;nbsp; The tutorial includes step by step instructions in patient positioning, equipment use, how to hold the probe, scanning protocols and required images.&amp;nbsp; For each required image, there is a photograph of the probe location, a representative ultrasound image from the site and audio instructions in how to achieve the view.&amp;nbsp; In addition, there is a section for each required view that covers what can go wrong.&amp;nbsp; This includes images from incorrect locations and how to improve the image to achieve the required results.&amp;nbsp; Virtual guidance has demonstrated successful imaging of the eye and carotid artery.&amp;nbsp; This project builds upon previous successes with Virtual Guidance by incorporating Augmented Reality, in the form of a 3-dimensional anatomical image,&amp;nbsp;improving the astronaut&amp;rsquo;s situational awareness. Untrained ultrasound operators will be recruited in the future to perform Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exams using only the Virtual Guidance audio/video tutorial. The quality of the resulting Images will be evaluated by an external expert.&lt;/p&gt;",
