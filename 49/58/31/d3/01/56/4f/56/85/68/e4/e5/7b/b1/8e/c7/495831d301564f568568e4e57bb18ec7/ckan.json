    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tPEAC&amp;rsquo;s novel technical approach is to leverage a low-power processor such as Aeroflex LEON-3 processor or ARM processor augmented with a co-processor, PEAC-Core, to be developed in this proposal that controls such critical system functions as power management, fault tolerance, and timing synchronization. It is based on observations of three major power-efficiency-limiting factors prevailing in conventional state-of-the-art space avionics: (1) Lack of adaptive, fine-grained, and multiple avionics power operational modes &amp;ndash; almost all existing avionics designs support merely on/off power modes at the box-level. Once powered on, it is never powered off, wasting significant amount of energy even during off-duty cycle; (2) Lack of effective usage of inherent low-power features of modern space-grade microelectronics parts such as clock-gating and multiple-power-mode for microprocessors and variable-voltage-scaling for other parts; and (3) Lack of finer-granularity match between the mission operational mode (typically bursty) and the avionics operational mode (typically flat). PEAC&amp;rsquo;s unique innovations are embodied in its three key components: (1) PEAC-Core: it is a central controller that handles power management, fault tolerance, and timing synchronization. It will provides on-demand and fine-grained power scheduling algorithm capable of trading performance and power consumption at run-time via systematic power management at both board and chip level. In particular, PEAC uses dual power domains: always-on domain &amp;ndash; is always powered and provides minimal functions such as timer and CCSDS Critical Relay Command Handling, consumes minimal power of less than 100 &amp;micro;W, and at-times-changed domain &amp;ndash; it is managed at runtime with multiple power profiles adapted to various mission operational modes; (2) PEAC-designtime: it is a set of design guidelines of low-power board/firmware/software (such as clock gating, variable voltage scaling, etc.), power-aware RTL IP cores, power-aware.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n",
