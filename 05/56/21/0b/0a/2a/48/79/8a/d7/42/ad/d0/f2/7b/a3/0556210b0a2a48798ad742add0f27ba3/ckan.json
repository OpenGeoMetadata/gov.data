  "notes": "The objectives of this study were to compare refinery-related petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and nestling house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) at sites along the North Platte River Casper, Wyoming in 1997 and 1998; and to determine if contaminants were present in concentrations that could adversely affect the birds. Because trace element concentrations, mixed function oxidase activity, and the variation in DNA are often associated with petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in birds, each was measured as indicators of petroleum contamination. Sediment and aquatic invertebrates were also sampled for characterizing a possible contaminant source to the birds. Sampling areas included sites upstream (Game & Fish, Patterson-Zonta Park), adjacent to (Amoco Park, Texaco Refinery), and downstream (EKW State Park) of the former Amoco and Texaco oil refineries. We also sampled one site between the Amoco and Texaco Refineries (Crossroads Park). Additional samples were taken using adult cliff swallows (Hirundo pyrrhonota) nesting under various bridges along the North Platte River in 1998. Several aliphatic hydrocarbons were detected in sediment, aquatic invertebrates, and carcasses and gastrointestinal contents of house wren and tree swallow nestlings and adult bam and cliff swallows from all sites but differences among sites were not significant. The low pristane to n-C17 ratio in avian diet and tissues did not suggest chronic or acute exposure of birds to petroleum at any of the locations. However, the high phytane to n-C18 ratios of the gastrointestinal contents may indicate that some of the dietary items consumed by the birds were recently or chronically exposed to petroleum products. This study demonstrates that some refinery-related contaminants are bioavailable and birds are being exposed. However, the data do not exhibit any pattern that can be linked to the refineries. Our small sample size and limited statistical power do not allow us to determine if any of the contaminants are adversely affecting the birds; and, the data collected on adult birds are inconclusive because exposure to contaminants may have occurred outside the sampling area. Additionally, for several contaminants detected, the upstream Game &Fish site appears to have concentrations similar to the study sites. Finally, we were unable to determine the influence of yearly variation on the results of the petroleum hydrocarbon or trace element analyses from 1997 and 1998; but, the 1997 data from the EKW State Park were not critical to the overall conclusions of the manuscript.",
