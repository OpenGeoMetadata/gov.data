  "notes": " \n        The proposed evaluation design consists of two main activities.  The first is an Initial Performance Evaluation (IPE), to be carried out in 2015.  The IPE will focus on a set of research questions that reflect short-term outcomes expected to change by the end of implementation.  These include: (i) improvements in knowledge and awareness as a result of the CLS training and outreach components; (ii) the effectiveness of CLS on the land policy dialogue; (iii) the ways in which the CLS approach to land administration reflects improvements on previous approaches, and the extent to which the MLR plans to carry these improvements forward; and (iv) changes in tenure security for individual and communal land users that may have occurred over a short time frame.  \n\nData that will be collected and analyzed for the IPE will consist mainly of 58 focus group discussions.  These will be conducted with land users in the project area, as well as government officials, Traditional Authorities, and members of Communal Land Boards.  These FGDs will be supplemented by a limited set of key informant interviews.  Finally, a Quantitative Knowledge Assessment Tool (QKAT) in the form of a brief questionnaire measuring knowledge of land issues will be administered to the approximately 40-60 government and traditional authorities who participate in the focus groups.  \n\nThe second proposed activity will be a Follow-On Performance Evaluation (FOPE) to be carried out in 2016.  The FOPE will consider the potential impacts of CLS that require a longer time frame to unfold.  These include economic outcomes for participating households, the sustainability of CLS, as well as some of the outcomes considered in the IPE that would be expected to further evolve over time, such as tenure security and the MLR's continued utilization of processes and tools developed by CLS.  The approach to data collection will be broadly similar to the IPE, consisting of FGDs, KIIs, and the QKAT.  The specifics of the FOPE will be revisited following the IPE in order to draw on lessons learned from that process.\n      ",
