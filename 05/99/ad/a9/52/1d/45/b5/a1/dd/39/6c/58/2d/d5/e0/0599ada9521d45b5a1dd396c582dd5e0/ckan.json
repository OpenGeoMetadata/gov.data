    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides the results of soil physical property and chemical measurements of samples collected from two pasture chronosequences (years since conversion from primary forest) located on two ranches south of Santarem, Para, Brazil, and east of the Tapajos River. Soil data includes soil classification, bulk density, texture, and mean concentrations of total nitrogen (N), carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and P fractions. The soils were high clay oxisols and highly sandy entisols.One chronosequence of sites was established on oxisol soils dating 2, 7, and 15 years since conversion from primary forest. A second set of sites, 1, 7, and 15 years old was established on the sandy entisols. Five of the six pasture sites were on a single ranch; the 2-year-old oxisol pasture was the exception. Ten soil samples per site were collected from 0-10 cm depth along random intervals within 100-m transects in August 1997.There are two comma-delimited (.csv) data files with this data set.",
