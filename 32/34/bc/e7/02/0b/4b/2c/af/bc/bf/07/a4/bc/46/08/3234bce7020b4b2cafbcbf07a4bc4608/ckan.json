  "notes": "  Program Capabilities  KAN-DO Laboratory is fully equipped to perform the chemical analyses of food and drugs regulated by the agency. The laboratory has program capabilities for pesticide residues in human food and animal feeds; industrial chemical residues including perchlorates, melamine, and melamine analogs; toxic and nutritional elements in human food, animal feeds, and ceramics; mycotoxins including fumonisins, aflatoxins, patulin, ochratoxin and vomitoxin; dioxins; chemotherapeutics in shrimp and crab; and micro-analytical analyses. In the area of pharmaceutical analysis, KAN-DO Laboratory can provide a full range of compendial determinations on human drugs and analyze surveillance drug samples using both official and non-official methods, and has been performing research on and analyses of dietary supplements for most of the past decade.  Specialized Capabilities  KAN-DO Laboratory is the national servicing center for FDA&amp;#39;s Total Diet Study (TDS), an ongoing surveillance program that originated in 1961. The laboratory is the central point in ORA for the planning, receipt, preparation, and analyses of approximately 280 food items common in the American diet, including infant/toddler foods. These items comprise each of four &amp;quot;Market Baskets&amp;quot; processed annually. Analyses performed by the laboratory include herbicides, fungicides, 15 toxic or nutritional elements, and approximately 750 pesticides and industrial chemicals. Most of these determinations are made at levels considerably lower - often in the low part-per-billion range. KAN-DO Laboratory also provides prepared samples to WEAC and ARL for analyses of radionuclides and dioxins, respectively. The Method Development Group, including the Total Diet and Pesticide Research Center, develops new methods and improves procedures for the determination of chemical residues in complex matrices including foods, animal feeds, and dietary supplements. The group is also responsible for bringing online new methods developed by other sources (e.g. FCC, NOAA). Current areas of research include improved and expanded methods for mycotoxins and chemotherapeutics, identification and quantitation of components of dietary supplements; and development of improved methods for the TDS including greater sensitivity, broader analytical coverage, and multi-residue techniques. KAN-DO Laboratory is one of the primary laboratories for the analysis of products for melamine and its analogs, particularly cyanuric acid. The laboratory has extensive experience with perse and complex matrices - both as prepared foods and inpidual components, and provides experienced analysts for the review of private laboratory results.
