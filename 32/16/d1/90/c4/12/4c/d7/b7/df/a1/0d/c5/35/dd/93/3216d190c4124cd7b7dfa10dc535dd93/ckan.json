  "notes": "Economic places used to tabulate Economic Census data vary from places used to tabulate data from the decennial census, the American Community Survey and other demographic surveys.  In addition to incorporated places and census designated places (CDPs), economic places include, minor civil divisions (MCDs) in the twelve strong MCD states, and balances of MCDs or counties. An incorporated place, CDP, MCD, or balance of MCD qualifies as an economic place if it contains 2,500 or more people according to the 2010 Decennial Census, or 2,500 or more jobs according to data from the 2006-2010 5-year ACS period estimates, or is a new or significantly revised place since the 2010 Census and has an estimated population of 2,500 or greater. The Economic Census place boundaries are as of January 1, 2012.\r\n",
