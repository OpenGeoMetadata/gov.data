    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set provides a time series of land cover classifications for Ariquemes, Ji-Parana, and Luiza, research sites in Rondonia, Brazil. The land cover classifications are derived from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors.  The time period ranges from June 1975 through June 2000, but all areas do not have images for all the years. The images were classified into the following categories: 1. Primary upland forest, representing the dominant natural vegetation in the area; 2. Pasture and green pasture; 3. Second growth, dominated by small trees and shrubs with low species diversity and biomass relative to primary forest; 4. Soil/urban; 5. Rock/savanna; 6. Water;  and 7. Cloud and smoke obscured. In addition, areas covered by rock and savanna were mapped and all areas outside of the overlap zone between all dates within a scene, and scene edges, were masked.There are 75 GeoTIFF files (.tif) with this data set which includes: classified images (*ful.tif) and a corresponding image mask (*ful_mask .tif) for each date (with the exception of 1978 and 1996 images for Ji-Parana, for which there are only ful_mask.tif files), and three mask files for rock, savannah, and scene edges, for each area. By area, there are 31 images for Ariquemes, 23 images for Ji-Parana, and 21 images for Luiza. ",
