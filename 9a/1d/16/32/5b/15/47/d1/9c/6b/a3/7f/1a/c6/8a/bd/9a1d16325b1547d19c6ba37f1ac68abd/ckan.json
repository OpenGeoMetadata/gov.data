  "notes": "The Western Governors' Association (WGA) Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool (CHAT; http://westgovchat.org/), launched in December 2013, is a starting point for discussing the intersection of development and wildlife. The CHAT is the product of coordination among state fish and wildlife agencies working under the direction and guidance of the WGA to define crucial fish and wildlife habitat more consistently across state lines. The result is intended to improve understanding of fish and wildlife habitat priorities among the states and can be useful for both state-specific and inter-state queries. The crucial habitat dataset is intended to facilitate landscape decision-making in the early stages of land use project planning, and to facilitate efforts to identify important areas for conservation using regionally consistent analyses and data definitions.States compiled data encompassing several data types and layers of information including habitat for species of concern (terrestrial and aquatic), landscape condition (a summary of native and unfragmented habitat; prioritizes large natural areas and connectivity zones between them), wetlands and riparian areas, and habitat for species of economic and recreation importance (terrestrial and aquatic). Relative priorities within each group were aggregated into a final crucial habitat rank. States sought consensus on how information was aggregated and final relative ranks calculated; however, it was ultimately up to individual states to apply rules that made the most sense for their geography and supporting data.",
