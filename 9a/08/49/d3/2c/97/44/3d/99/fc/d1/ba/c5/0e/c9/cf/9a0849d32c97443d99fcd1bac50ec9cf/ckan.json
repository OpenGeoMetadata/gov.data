  "notes": " Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE&amp;#8482;) The  ACE Team  provides the ability to conduct fullscale interactive virtual CAD reviews using the CAVE. Capabilities TARDEC&amp;#39;s CAVE helps users understand physical vehicle systems using CAD data and immersive 3-D technologies. Design reviews are performed for evaluating vehicle exteriors and interior compartments from virtually any vantage point, and can determine lines of sight, evaluate general &amp;quot; fit-form-function&amp;quot; studies and crew usability. Alternative designs, configurations or variants are compared early in the design process and throughout life-cycle phases as necessary, which allows for &amp;quot;if-then&amp;quot; studies to be conducted at minimal cost. Videos can also be developed to present findings and scenarios to decision makers. Benefits &amp;#8226; The CAVE provides better communication of design intent than alternative types of presentations. &amp;#8226; A better understanding of fit-form-function and crew usability early in the design process. &amp;#8226; Full-scale dynamic visual lines of sight identify crew blind spots early, precluding future issues. &amp;#8226; Exploring alternatives early in design stage leads to better decisions and reduced cost. &amp;#8226; Detailed videos can be viewed anywhere and used for presentations, or as an official record. High Performance Computing (HPC) TARDEC&amp;#39;s HPC Center enhances research, development, engineering, testing and evaluation capabilities through state-of-the-art scientific and engineering computing. By aggregating computing power, the system delivers higher performance than a typical desktop computer or workstation could produce to solve large analytical problems. The HPC Center provides a full-spectrum, high-end computing environment for use on TARDEC, PEO and Army ground vehicle programs and initiatives. Capabilities HPC assists in quickly providing decision makers required information within challenging timelines. The HPC Center houses two systems to provide unclassified and classified analysis capabilities. The systems allow for the creation and analysis of high-end physics-based models to provide a better (and sometimes the only) insight into complex, real-world issues. Benefits &amp;#8226; Solving analytical problems that cannot be done or completed on time via desktop resources. &amp;#8226; Centralized support and management allows the HPC user to concentrate on the problem at hand and not on system operation. &amp;#8226;S eparate classified and unclassified assets are available. &amp;#8226; Local administration allows for faster reprioritization of resources when needed.
