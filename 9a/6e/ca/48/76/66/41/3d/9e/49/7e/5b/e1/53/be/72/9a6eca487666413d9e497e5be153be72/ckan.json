These petitions and other records relating to watershed districts in Kansas are maintained by the Division of Water Resources in the Kansas Department of Agriculture. Most of the legal descriptions were converted to digital geographic coordinates of longitude and latitude using the KGS's LEO II software. Exterior boundaries of the lands included in each watershed were compiled using the Dpoly software, also developed at the KGS. Portions of some boundaries were digitized directly from 1:24,000 scale topographic maps, from the United States Geological Survey. Some incorporated cities are explicitly excluded from watersheds in the legal descriptions. The digital representation of the boundaries of these cities, as used in this coverage, were extracted from the 1990 Pre-Census TIGER files distributed by the U.S. Census Bureau.",
