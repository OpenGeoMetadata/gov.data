  "notes": "The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a method for estimating the mobility and potential alongshore transport of heavier-than-water sand and oil agglomerates (tarballs or surface residual balls, SRBs). During the Deepwater Horizon spill, some oil that reached the surf zone of the northern Gulf of Mexico mixed with suspended sediment and sank to form sub-tidal mats. If not removed, these mats can break apart to form SRBs and subsequently re-oil the beach. A method was developed for estimating SRB mobilization and alongshore movement. A representative suite of wave conditions was identified from buoy data for April, 2010, until August, 2012, and used to drive a numerical model of the spatially-variant alongshore currents. Potential mobilization of SRBs was estimated by comparing combined wave- and current-induced shear stress from the model to critical stress values for several sized SRBs. Potential alongshore flux of SRBs was also estimated to identify regions more or less likely to have SRBs deposited under each scenario. This methodology was developed to explain SRB movement and redistribution in the alongshore, interpret observed re-oiling events, and thus inform re-oiling mitigation efforts.",
