    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Hybrid-Electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) is becoming widely accepted and new tools will be required for future development with validation and demonstrations during ground and eventually flight testing. Intelligent health management will be paramount to any future ground and flight testing activities planned by the industry on HEDP systems.  To support this, an intelligent prognostics and health management (ePHM) system will be designed and executed for the HEDP system on the NASA Dryden Hybrid Electric Integrated System Teststand (HEIST) (AirVolt optional), which will be developed as part of a parallel Phase III SBIR by ESAero, the proposer here.  Most developments in PHM surround air vehicle subsystems and avionics, specifically on the electronic board level, and many of these are integrated after the systems are designed.  These developments have or are establishing the ability to monitor the degradation of a subsystem in real-time, making it conceivable that actionable information can be fed to a Integrated Autonomous Controller for self-repair decisions, leveraging the Propulsion Airframe Integration benefits.  Reliability can be calculated and maintenance can be planned ahead of time rather than at the point of failure, significantly increasing safety.  \r\nGeneral Atomics, Electromagnetic Systems Group (GA) will continue to play a vital role.",
