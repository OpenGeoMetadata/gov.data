    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Inputs to the processor could include&amp;nbsp;space mission solid wastes, such as biodegradable packaging, but focused largely on cellulose from inedible plant materials. This celluose could be the&amp;nbsp;ineidible&amp;nbsp;portion&amp;nbsp;of biomass from plants that might be used for future life support systems (e.g., inedible leaves, stems and roots). The&amp;nbsp;processor itself consisted of two reactors or compartments: The first compartment contained cellulose degrading fungi to produce simple sugars, such as glucose. The second compartment contained yeast that used the glucose to produce milk fat.&amp;nbsp; The overall intent was to combine the two processes in one single reactor column, hence the name &amp;quot;Cow-in-a-Column&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process could also be adapted to generate&amp;nbsp;high value protein, such as milk casein, or even biofuels such as methane, biodiesel, or solvents. The project involved selecting and testing various microorganisms for their ability to convert the different wastes into the target products. This also required accurate chemical assays&amp;nbsp;of the end products to verify the column performance. The concepts were demonstrated by the end of the 1-year project but further testing is needed to demonstrate sustained operation and / or to expand the process to produce other products. Future testing could involve the use of genetically&amp;nbsp;engineered microbes to improve the overall efficiency of converting solid wastes into edible products.&lt;/p&gt;",
