  "notes": "This shapefile containing 50 meter height data has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants. However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development projects. The shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution,0 in a UTM zone 12, datum WGS 84 projection system.\r\n\r\n_Additional Resources_ - The [SWERA Programme](http://en.openei.org/apps/SWERA/ \"SWERA Interactive Web Portal\") provides easy access to high quality renewable energy resource information and data to users all around the world. Its goal is to help facilitate renewable energy policy and investment by making high quality information freely available to key user groups. SWERA products include Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and time series data, along with links to energy optimization tools needed to apply these data.\r\n\r\n_Note_ - In order to ensure the downloadable shapefile is current, please compare the date updated on this page to the last updated date on the [NREL GIS Wind Data](http://www.nrel.gov/gis/data_international.html \"NREL GIS Wind Data webpage\") webpage.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\r\n\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
