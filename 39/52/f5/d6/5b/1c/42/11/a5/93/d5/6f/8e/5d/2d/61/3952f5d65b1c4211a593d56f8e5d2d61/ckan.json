  "notes": " The Pulse Power Laboratory has 2.5 million volt-amp power supply for testing of Advanced Energy systems (High Power Systems). Building is also specially grounded with the capability to discharge 1 million amps without damage to equipment and facilities. Two Shielded Rooms are capable of shielding against Low Frequency magnetic fields and High Power Microwaves simultaneously with secure areas allowing real-time Classified Data Processing. Two Highbays for integrating technologies onto mobile platforms. Equipment and facilities include: Anechoic Chamber (EM and RF Shielded), High Bay with Crane, 6 Mega Joule Capacitor Bank, Ultra Short Pulse Laser Laboratory Annex, and laboratory work benches. This World Class High power Laboratory is capable of providing High Voltage and High current requirements. The unique capabilities of this facility are crucial in the development of Directed Energy Weapon Systems and Non-conventional / Directed energy Technologies. Possible applications include In-Theatre Force Protection, Homeland Defense and Facility Protection Systems. It integrates specialized diagnostics and data acquisition assembled for measuring and processing the ultrawideband and high power systems being developed for the future warfighter. High Voltage capabilities Up to 1 million Volts with applications to include: High Power Microwave systems Laser weapon systems High voltage components High Current capabilities 100,000 &amp;quot; 500,000 Amps @ 20,000 &amp;quot;30,000 volts Test Components for Pulse Forming Networks Kinetic Energy Weapons Electromagnetic Propulsion Guns Electro Thermo Chemical Guns  ",
