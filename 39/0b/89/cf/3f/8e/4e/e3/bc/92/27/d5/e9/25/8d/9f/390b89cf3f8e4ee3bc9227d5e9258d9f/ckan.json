    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Activities advance the development of scientific instruments or instrument components to the point where the instruments could credibly be proposed in response to future flight opportunity announcements, including instruments that could be accommodated on or in small satellites (under 50kg total spacecraft mass), or as small payloads in support of future science activities associated with missions of human exploration (proposals to build and fly hardware on a specific mission opportunity are not a part of this program element and the development of instruments for use in future field campaigns is under ASTEP).\n\nThe scientific goals and objectives of NASA?s Astrobiology program are described in the Astrobiology Roadmap that is available on the Astrobiology web site at http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap. Instrumentation and astrobiology mission concepts developed from research supported through this ASTID program element are meant to address two fundamental questions in Astrobiology, namely, ?How does life begin and evolve?? and ?Does life exist elsewhere in the Universe?? Objectives that could be addressed by new spacecraft instrumentation and astrobiology small payload missions include, for example:\n? To determine whether the atmosphere of the early Earth, hydrothermal systems, or exogenous matter were significant sources of organic matter;\n? To search for evidence of ancient climates, extinct life, and potential habitats for extant life on Mars;\n? To determine the presence of chemical precursors and potential habitats for life in the outer Solar System; and\n? To determine if compounds of biological significance are present beyond our Solar System.\n",
