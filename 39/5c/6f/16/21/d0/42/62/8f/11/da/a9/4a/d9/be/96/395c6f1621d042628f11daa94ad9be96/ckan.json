    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "NASA space missions utilizing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) under extreme conditions have a critical need for high performance analog cell libraries to support the mission requirements. With the introduction of silicon germanium (SiGe) processes, there is an opportunity to provide resilient analog circuit designs that handle both temperature and radiation hardening requirements. Our experience has indicated that meeting extreme temperature requirements is as challenging as meeting the radiation-hardening requirements and innovation in this area is warranted. Maintaining key operating specifications such as linearity and dynamic range while under both extreme temperature and radiation exposure conditions is a difficult problem requiring an innovative solution.\r\nRidgetop Group will build a cell library of key \"building block\" analog cells needed for pipeline, flash and successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs; and capacitor array DACs. We will develop transistor-level designs and simulate these blocks to prove feasibility and demonstrate the effectiveness of the minimal temperature response (MTR) design techniques. After achieving desired MTR, rad-hard by design (RHBD) methods will be employed to meet the radiation specs. In Phase 2 of this SBIR program Ridgetop will fabricate and test a 12-bit ADC based on this library to validate its efficacy.",
