    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The HET2 Astrobee Element will focus on developing a new free-flying robot suitable for performing IVA work on the International Space Station (ISS). The new robot will build upon technology and lessons learned from the Smart Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellite (SPHERES) robot, which was developed and tested by the Human Exploration Telerobotics (HET) project under the Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) program. Astrobee will be designed to address a variety of use cases, which will be developed and detailed in collaboration with the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program and the ISS SPHERES Facility in the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). Candidate use cases include a remotely operated mobile sensor platoform for IVA surveys (camera views, sound level surveys, etc.), automated logistics (e.g., mobile inventory with a RFID reader), and free-flying robotic test bed in micro-gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the highest level, the Astrobee&amp;nbsp;system includes the free-flying robot itself, a dock/resupply station for replenishing power, and any necessary hardware and software for communication, control and data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrobee will be self-contained and autonomous. Ideally it will be capable of fully autonomous localization and navigation inside the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the International Space Station. Astrobee will have video cameras on board that will allow it to serve as a remotely operated mobile camera platform, and may be used for localization and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrobee will also have an expansion ports where additional sensors and/or hardware can be attached for demonstration, testing and use aboard the station. Additional sensors that may be attached to or integrated with the Astrobee include a RFID reader and the necessary software to communicate with the inventory management system, a HD camera, and a sound level meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrobee will communicate principally via the station LAN. The propulsion is likely to be electric-motor-driven fans. Localization may include vision-based navigation with and without fiducials, IR beacon localization, and Wi-Fi localization. The Astrobee will also include a perching arm to grab ISS handrails; this will allow the Astrobee to hold position without using its propulsion system.&lt;/p&gt;",
