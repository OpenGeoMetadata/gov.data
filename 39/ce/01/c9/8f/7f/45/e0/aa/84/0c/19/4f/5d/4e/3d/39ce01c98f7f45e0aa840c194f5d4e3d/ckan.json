Hooker Research Library offers a full range of traditional and digital library services to enhance and support the research program of the Naval Research Laboratory. Traditional library services include a physical facility for study and research, staffed with subject specialists and information professionals to assist researchers in locating and retrieving published information. A rich and extensive journal, technical report, and book collection has been created and maintained over the80+-year history of the library. To enhance traditional services, the library isactively expanding the NRLDigital Library (http://library.nrl.navy.mil), which provides access to thousands of journals, books, and reference sources at desktops at NRL-DC, NRL-Stennis, NRL-Monterey, and the Office of Naval Research. DESCRIPTION: The Library collections focus on physics, chemistry, electronics, and space sciences. They include 150,000 books and journal volumes, 4,000 current journal subscriptions, and over 2 million technical reports in paper, microfiche, or electronic format. The collections are regularly analyzed, organized, and updated to provide quick and easy retrieval of the most appropriate items. Services include the following: reference assistance in using the collections and locating information from external sources; mediated literature searches of several hundred online databases, including classified databases, to produce on-demand subject bibliographies; circulation of materials from the collection including classified literature up to the SECRET level; interlibrary loan and document delivery to obtain needed items from other scientific and research libraries or from commercial document providers; ordering all journals for office retention; and user education and outreach to help researchers improve productivity through effective use of both the physical library and the Digital Library resources available through TORPEDO Ultra and the World Wide Web.TheTORPEDO Ultra digital repository providesdesktop access to more than 8 million full content items; thousands of research journals; hundreds of technical databases; and reference tools including Web of Science, SCOPUS, and INSPEC.
