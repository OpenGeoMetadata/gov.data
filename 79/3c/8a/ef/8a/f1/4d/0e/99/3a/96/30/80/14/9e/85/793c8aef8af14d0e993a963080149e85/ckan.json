    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Cryogenic propellants are important to NASA's missions. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage and transfer are critical to future long duration NASA spacecraft and missions. Advanced Cooled Shield - IMLI (ACS-IMLI) is an innovative ultra high performance system in which an Advanced Cooled Shield is fully integrated into the IMLI layer structure, reducing mass, forming a single robust system, with integrated cooled gas distribution in a cooled shield layer, eliminating heat flux through thermal shield tank standoffs or supports, and operable in both passive (vapor cooled shield) and active (broad area cooled shield) modes.\r\n\r\nNASA's TA-02 Roadmap calls \"Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions\" the #2 ranked technical challenge for NASA mission objectives and needs.  Quest Thermal Group has developed IMLI, an advanced thermal insulation that uses proprietary discrete spacer technology to reduce heat flux. IMLI's unique structure is able to self support various loads, including a thin, lightweight vacuum shell for in-air operation, high strength ballistic layers for MMOD shielding, an external Broad Area Cooling Shield with cooling tubing, or an integrated thermal shield within the layers. IMLI's layer structure gives it unique capabilities, such as an embedded conductive, sealed thermal barrier. \r\n\r\nIn this Phase I program, an ACS-IMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for structural strength and thermal performance.  Advanced Cooled Shield &amp;#150; IMLI (ACS-IMLI) could provide a lower mass, single insulation system, operable in both passive (vapor cooled) and active (cryocooled) modes, with 3 &amp;#150; 4X lower heat flux than IMLI alone. ACS-IMLI could help meet NASA's cryogenic fluid management requirements such as Zero Boil Off for cryogenic propellant storage and transfer.",
