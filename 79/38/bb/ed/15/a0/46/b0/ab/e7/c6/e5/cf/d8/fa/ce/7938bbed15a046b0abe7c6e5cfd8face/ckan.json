    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "A ferroelectric non-linear dielectric was recently discovered that, in their film form, possess a number of properties that make it an excellent choice for radiation-hardened electronics, particularly a radiation hardened (total dose hardened and SEE immune) non-volatile (NV) static random access memory (SRAM).  Electrical measurements of these films demonstrated a relatively low dielectric constant (~20), an inherent ability to form a native buffer layer when deposited directly on silicon, and a strong polarization hysteresis effect. These results indicate that this film may be used to replace the two n-channel and two p-channel transistors in a traditional 4-T SRAM latch cell with two n-channel and two p-channel non-linear dielectric field effect transistors (NLDFETs). The threshold voltage hysteresis effect of the NLDFET should achieve full SEU immunity to at least 80MeV-cm2/mg of ionizing radiation, when used in a standard 6-transistor SRAM cell structure, thus have ultra-fast access times (like commercial SRAMs) while offering full non-volatility.  In Phase I we will provide the device proof of concept, then in Phase II build a prototype memory.  Phase III will see commercialization by licensing and sales. The resulting NV-SRAM products have the potential to be orders of magnitude faster than any existing EEPROM or FLASH devices because the nonlinear dielectric film forms a native dielectric with silicon giving the structure resistance to \"wear-out\" or \"data-retention\" problems.  Finally, the SMI material is fully compatible with CMOS processing and has been accepted into major commercial silicon fabrication lines as a high-k dielectric for linear applications.",
