  "notes": "  Purpose:  The Electro-Optical Laboratory (EOL) and Laser Laboratory are collocated in the Aircraft Platform Interface (API) facility. The EOL provides a variety of capabilities from test and evaluation of Electro-Optical Sensor and Display systems to the prototyping and design of remote sensing equipment. The Laser Lab supports shipboard lighting systems across all Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) platforms and provides capabilities that span throughout the life cycle of ALRE optical and lighting systems. The Laser Lab conducts all radiometric based measurements; spectral response, color coordinates, transmission, reflectance, radiance and irradiance testing; and all NVIS measurements including NRa, NRb, NRIa and NRIb.  Function:  The EOL and Laser Laboratory not only share space, but they also share equipment, facilities and expertise to accomplish their missions. The Laser Lab, which meets all safety requirements of ANSI Z136.1, is a high-quality dark room that provides measurement equipment and a high-power Ti-Sapphire tunable LASER with lab facilities to accurately conduct measurements and evaluation of lighting and optical systems. The EOL provides the functionality and products required for its various capabilities such as the capability to develop test and evaluation tools for the Navy&amp;#39;s Virtual Imaging System for Approach and Landing (VISUAL), an electro-optical sensor and display system that provides enhanced images of recovering aircraft aboard ships.  Capabilities:  The EOL&amp;#39;s span of capabilities includes: design, prototyping, demonstration and testing of remote sensing equipment; development and testing of electro-optical tracking systems; infrared radiometric measurements; evaluation of imaging sensors; development, integration and test of display technologies and processing equipment for the Navy&amp;#39;s Landing Signal Officer Display System; work with the CVN78 Integrated Launch and Recovery Testing and Surveillance (ILARTS) system; and work with the Improved Embarked Aircraft Tracking System (IEATS). The Laser Lab provides capabilities that can support and accommodate Night Vision compatible lighting; radiometric and photometric measurement and analysis; and flat panel display measurements for radiance (brightness) and color.
