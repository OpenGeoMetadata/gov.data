    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Our proposed Phase I program will develop a reactor system for the\nsynthesis of polyethylene from carbon dioxide and water.  The proposed\nwork will result in hardware capable of the in-situ fabrication of\nhigh-density polyethylene suitable for the construction of inflatable\nenclosures and panels, which can be used to construct extraterrestrial\nhabitats.  In-situ production of habitat structural materials would\nresult in substantial cost savings compared with transporting the\nmaterial from Earth.  The system will serve as an engineering prototype\nfor for future missions to demonstrate in-situ production of\nconsumables.  We expect that the technology to produce ethylene and\npolyethylene will be sufficiently mature to be considered for\ndemonstration in the 2005 or 2007 programs. Our proposed program\naddresses two fundamental technology issues: (1) In Situ Synthesis of\nHydrocarbon Fuels and Oxygen (2) In Situ Synthesis of Materials for\nIsolated Habitat Construction and Support. It addresses several key\ncrosscut issues based on the use of In Situ Resources, e.g., - Life\nSupport for Spacecraft Including Space Station Freedom - Life Support\nfor Lunar and Martian Bases and Colonies - Propellants for Propulsion\nfor Planetary Rovers and Return Vehicles.",
