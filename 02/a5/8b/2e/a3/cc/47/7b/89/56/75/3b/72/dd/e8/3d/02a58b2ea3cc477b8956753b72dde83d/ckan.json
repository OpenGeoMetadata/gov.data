    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Turbulent flows associated with advanced aerodynamic designs represent a considerable challenge for accurate prediction. For example, the flow past low-speed wings requires the representation of complex physics involving separation onset/progression (both leading-and trailing-edge), vortex/viscous interactions, merging shear layers with strong curvature, juncture flows and jet-exhaust flows ? all phenomena that are not amenable to robust modeling and simulation by traditional grid-based techniques.  Recent advances in the technology of gridfree turbulent flow simulation via vortex methods, most notably as manifested in the VorCat code, has raised the possibility of efficiently and accurately capturing the behavior of aerodynamic flows for use in design and performance analysis. The goal of this SBIR phase I proposal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of VorCat in simulating high lift airfoil flows ? both in regards to computational speed and accuracy. This will form the basis for developing a tool able to well model arbitrary aerodynamic flows past finite wings including complicating features such as flow control devices in the Phase II study.  Upon completion of Phase II, a validated technology will be ready for use by industrial and governmental users. ",
