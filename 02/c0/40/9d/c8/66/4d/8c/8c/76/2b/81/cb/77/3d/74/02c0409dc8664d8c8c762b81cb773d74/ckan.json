  "notes": "Drought was shown to influence the cycles of elements within the Swamp, which illustrated the importance of climatic factors as driving forces in controlling the availability of elements. The fact that seasonal and annual cycles of elements can be altered by events such as drought and heavy periods of rainfall also suggests that in geologic time these short-term episodic shifts in elemental compositions are probably just part of an overall series of cycles that are relatively unimportant in the long term. Given the geologic history of the Swamp, the periodic swings in the various cycles probably even out, even though short-term temporal differences may influence temporary differences in nutrient and element availability and distribution within the system. However, these small cyclic events may have spatial significance within the Swamp. Concentrations of the spatial location in the Swamp and are not consistent from one location to the next. These differences reflect the peculiarity of each area that is governed by their respective hydrology, physical and biological characteristics (flow, elevation, vegetation). Precipitation is a major contributor of minerals and nutrients to the Okefenokee Swamp. Although mercury concentrations in rainwater are similar to those reported elsewhere, they are sufficiently high to account for the elevated concentrations measured in the water and sediment matrices of the Swamp and also the biota. The Swamp acts as a sump for mercury and lead; these elements enter the system through rainfall and are stored in the sediment and floc and bioaccumulated in the biota. Current levels of mercury and lead within the various matrices of the Swamp may pose a danger to the indigenous wildlife. Predators in the Swamp may have the highest potential for impact through consumption of prey organisms that have elevated levels of mercury and lead. Although concentrations of mercury and lead appear to be declining, based on core data, levels are sufficiently high to cause concern. For this reason, developments within the airshed that have the potential to increase atmospheric contamination with lead or mercury should be avoided. Current concentrations of these elements are below those known to cause acute responses, but they are at levels that could have chronic effects on the behavioral, physiological, and reproductive systems of resident biota.",
