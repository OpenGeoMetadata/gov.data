  "notes": "Woodward-Clyde Consultants performed site investigations at five sites owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas from October 24-28, 1988. The objectives of the investigation were (1) to evaluate the presence or absence of contaminants based on laboratory testing of surface and subsurface soil samples and visual observations and (2) to recommend appropriate cleanup and disposal methods. Cost estimates for cleanup and disposal were requested for some sites. Where significant data gaps were apparent regarding potential contamination, recommendations were made for the development of work plans which, if implemented, would supply the missing data. Only one site, a former municipal dump (Garza), is recommended for further investigation to evaluate potential contamination of the groundwater which was not sampled during this investigation. A former naval transmitter site (Fronton) was inspected and surface soils were analyzed for PCB contamination. PCB levels of up to 350 parts per million were recorded. Cleanup and disposal of PCB contaminated material is estimated to cost approximately $38,000 - $100,000 depending upon disposal methods. Analytical testing of surface and subsurface soils from an above-ground trash dump (Cottam) did not reveal significant levels of contaminants. Visual inspection of the site recorded the presence of an empty drum labeled \"radioactive\" and a 5-gallon bucket of polyurethane coating. Cleanup and disposal costs for all other debris at the site are estimated at approximately $30,000 subject to favorable site conditions for cleanup. A surface soil sample taken from a site where 55-gallon drums have been illegally dumped (Madero) did not reveal the presence of contaminants. Two drums, however, were found to contain unknown liquids. As a worst case, analytical testing of the liquids would cost approximately $2,000 per sample and disposal by incineration would cost approximately $300 per drum. Visual inspection and analytical testing of surface soils at a former farm headquarters (Hidalgo) revealed the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides. Depending upon the method of disposal, estimated costs for cleanup and disposal are $29,000 - $97,000.",
