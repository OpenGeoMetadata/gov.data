  "notes": " The Propulsion Lab simulates field test conditions in a controlled environment, using standardized or customized test procedures. The Propulsion Lab&amp;#39;s 11 cells can test vehicles for full-load cooling; tractive effort vs. speed; fuel economy; air conditioning; engine (performance, endurance, qualification, acceptance); transmission performance and efficiency; and drive axle endurance. Cell 4&amp;#39;s upgrades open partnership opportunities for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to collaborate with TARDEC to baseline and test potential powertrain technologies for an Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. In 2015, Cell 5 will become the upgraded Combat Powertrain Lab (CPL), adding new capabilities to TARDEC&amp;#39;s laboratory facilities including Regenerative Steer Testing and Road Load Simulation (RLS). The CPL allows engineers to perform regenerative steer testing on complete vehicles, transmissions or power packs. Before the CPL was built, this type of testing was performed on a limited basis at an outside laboratory using inertia wheels that enable short-duration steer regeneration. The CPL provides a significant improvement by enabling continuous steering torque regeneration testing, which results in higher fidelity testing of tracked vehicle transmissions. The CPL also enables RLS testing, which allows a vehicle, transmission or power-pack to be operated on a mission profile or simulated terrain to evaluate the performance of the component or system. Incorporating this capability with other GSPEL test cells allows the vehicle to operate on a simulated terrain in highly controlled environments. The combined effect of using the simulated terrain and controlled environment allows for highly directed studies of failure modes, performance improvements, fuel economy and capabilities of vehicle systems and sub systems.  Capabilities; Six cells contain dynamometers. Three full vehicle/transmission/drive axle cells are designed for both steady-state and transient tests. Cells offer simulated heat to 160&amp;#176; F and wind speeds up to 20 mph.  Benefits:  &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; The test cell&amp;#39;s total sprocket output load absorbing capacity permits testing of any known military ground vehicle in any transmission gear range. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; CPL&amp;#39;s enhanced capabilities will allow testing prior to fielding, saving both time and money. &amp;#8226;&amp;#8194; RLS will allow vehicle testing on simulated terrain in controlled environments. The combined effect enables failure mode analysis, performance improvements, fuel economy and vehicle system capabilities.  ",
