    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "This data set is a collection of measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 greenhouse gases made across North America by nine independent atmospheric monitoring networks from 2000 - 2009. During this North American Carbon Program (NACP) sponsored activity, data were compiled from the following networks: AGAGE, COBRA, CSIRO, INTEX-A, INTEX B, Irvine Latitude Network, NOAA CMDL, SCRIPPS, and Stanley Tyler-UC Irvine. The files presented here are the products of merging multiple original measurement results files for selected sites across North America from each monitoring network. The primary focus of this effort was the compilation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases over North America, but numerous CO2 observations are also included. The data files for each network are accompanied by detailed readme documentation files prepared by the respective network investigators. Project descriptions, objectives, references, sampling and analysis methods, and data file descriptions are included in these READMEs. Table 1 in the documentation displays the monitoring network sites, sample types, analytes, and links to the detailed network README files. Network- and laboratory-specific data citations are included in the README documentation and should be used to acknowledge the use of these data as appropriate. The data files for each monitoring network and each sampling type (continuous or flasks) have been combined into one compressed (*.zip) file along with the detailed README document. There are 17 compressed files that when expanded contain data files which represent one years data for that specific campaign and sampling method. The number of annual files that were compiled from a network into this collection varies.",
