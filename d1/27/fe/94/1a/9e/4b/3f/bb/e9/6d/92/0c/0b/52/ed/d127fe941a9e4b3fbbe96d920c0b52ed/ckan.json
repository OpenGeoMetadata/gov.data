    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Reliable on-orbit dosimetry is necessary for understanding effects of space radiation environments on spacecraft microelectronics performance and comparison of on-orbit results to ground-based testing and modeling.  Understanding dosimetry at the micro-level is becoming increasingly necessary as microelectronic devices become more complex.  Several innovative dosimetry approaches are under development by various groups to meet these needs.  Spot shielding is commonly used to increase survivability of unhardened microelectronics in spacecraft design.  The efficacy of spot shielding to reduce the TID effects has recently come into question, with spot shielded FPGA devices degrading faster than unshielded devices on an MPTB space experiment.  A study is underway to understand this anomalous result and one product of the study will be a prototype space experiment board focused on testing spot shielding.  Both the dosimetry issue and the spot shielding issue are critical to use of COTS microelectronics in space system design.  We propose to combine the spot shielding experiment with emerging dosimetry approaches and develop hardware and software for a space experiment that provides real-time dosimetry from multiple dosimetry types.  The experiment will be designed using an innovative low power experiment card with plans for integration on the Space Environment Testbed (SET) Carrier.",
