    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;Because of their predictable pulsations, pulsars are highly reliable celestial clocks that can provide the same high-precision timing as the atomic clock signals supplied through the 26 satellite, military operated Global Positioning Satellite System (GPS)&amp;mdash;a space-age navigational capability now as ubiquitous as the stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this technique, NICER/SEXTANT will use its 56 X-ray telescopes, detectors, and other advanced technologies to detect X-ray photons from these powerful beams of pulsated light to estimate their arrival times. With these measurements, the system will use specially developed algorithms to stitch together an onboard navigation solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before the advent of GPS and now NICER/SEXTANT, humans relied on the sky and increasingly more sophisticated technology to find their way. And now, NASA scientists are developing NICER/SEXTANT, the latest incarnation of celestial navigation. This technique could extend humankind&amp;rsquo;s ability to navigate to the farthest reaches of the solar system and potentially beyond using pulsars as a timepiece. In a sense, the development follows a grand tradition that began thousands of years ago when the first travelers looked to the skies to venture beyond the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;",
