  "notes": "Since the establishment of the refuge in 1937, the primary goal has been to restore and manage wetlands and uplands habitats for nesting and migrant waterfowl. Refuge objectives include providing habitat to accommodate a diversity of hundreds of wildlife species for the benefit of people. Management for waterfowl production is accomplished primarily by manipulating water levels and by maintaining upland vegetation in early successional stages. Early succession is attained by burning, spraying, farming, mowing, dozing and a variety of other methods. Deer, moose, furbearers and many other species respond favorably to management practices and achieve high productivity. Predation alone does not keep populations from increasing to undesirable levels; hence, there is a need to harvest surplus animals. High winter mortality, depredation problems, and excessive disease are almost assured if big game populations are left unchecked. In short, hunting at Agassiz NWR is a necessary big game management tool. The Refuge Recreational Act of 1962 authorizes hunting as a valid form of recreation on National Wildlife Refuges provided that hunting does not interfere with primary objectives. The effects of hunting on refuges are evaluated in the Final Environmental Statement on the Operation of the National Wildlife Refuge System (1976). Public hunting was determined to be \"an acceptable and desirable form of wildlife-oriented recreation\" provided it was compatible with refuge objectives and was conducted as a quality program. Guidance in managing hunting programs on National Wildlife Refuges is provided in Title 16, United States Code, Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations Part 32, and in the Refuge Manual. Regulations to control hunting on National Wildlife Refuges are published in the Federal Register.",
