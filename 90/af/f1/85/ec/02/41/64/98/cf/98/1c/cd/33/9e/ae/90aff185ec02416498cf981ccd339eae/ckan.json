  "notes": "Small fish, representative of prey taken by interior least terns, did not appear to be contaminated by organochlorine pesticides or PCBs. Likewise, concentrations of these organochlorine compounds were below detection limits in sediment samples from each of the five segments of the river sampled. Heavy metals in these same fish samples were, for the most part, below concentrations of concern. Cadmium and lead were below detection limits, although admittedly these limits are equal to or slightly greater than the NCBP 85th percentile concentration for these two elements. Chromium and copper were in the range of \"normal\" background concentrations. Only zinc appeared to be significantly elevated in small fish samples. Without exception, zinc concentrations in these samples were 1.5 to 2.3 times higher than the NCBP 85th percentile concentration. Sediments did not appear contaminated with any of the heavy metals considered, as concentrations were substantially below both the EPA (1977) \"nonpolluted\" guidelines and Long and Morgan's (1990) suggested Effects Range-Low (ER-L) concentrations. Pollution from petroleum and petroleum-based products was clearly evident in both fish and sediment samples. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were present in all fish, and marked species differences in concentrations were noted. Sediment samples suggested a definite spatial pattern, with higher concentrations downstream. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were not measured in fish, since these compounds are normally metabolized. However, substantial quantities of PAHs were present in sediment samples from Zink Lake (segment M3) and directly below Zink Lake (segment M4).",
