The NARR model uses the very high resolution NCEP Eta Model (32km/45 layer) together with the Regional Data Assimilation System (RDAS) which, significantly, assimilates precipitation along with other variables. Data is output 4-8 times daily. Daily and Monthly values are available. The datasets starts in 1979.",
