  "notes": "During the past 14 years the sandhill crane nesting population on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) has decreased by 21% (down from 236 pairs in 1971 to 186 pairs in 1985). Of the remaining 186 pairs, 23 pairs are currently displaced by high water in Malheur, Mud and Harney lakes. This decline is significant considering that during this period (1974-1985) several major actions (grazing reductions, improved nesting cover, delayed haying dates, modified irrigation schedules) were implemented to enhance crane production. The primary causes for the decline were low recruitment due to high predation of nests by ravens, raccoons, and coyotes, and high predation by coyotes on chicks before fledging. As outlined in the Refuge Master Plan, sandhill crane production is the number one migratory bird objective for Malheur Refuge. The current objective at Malheur NWR is to fledge 150 crane chicks annually. Average production from 1966-84 was 31 chicks, 21% of the objective. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) proposes in conjunction with improving habitat to control predators (coyotes, ravens, and raccoons) on approximately 27,000 acres (14%) of Malheur NWR, Oregon beginning in the winter of 1985-86. The purpose of the proposed action is to minimize predator impacts on nesting greater sandhill cranes, to help stabilize the decline of a population that is currently classified as a \"sensitive species\" (USFWS, 1982). Predators will be controlled by refuge and Animal Damage Control (ADC) personnel. An estimated 250 coyotes will be removed the first year by the following methods: aerial gunning (75%), denning (10%), trapping and snares (8%), and calling and shooting (7%). An estimated 120 ravens will be removed the first year using chicken eggs injected with DRC-1339 (3-chloro-4-methylbenzenamine) a toxicant that is highly selective to corvids. An estimated 50 raccoons will be removed the first year by shooting (60%) and trapping (40%). If the proposed action proves successful in the first year the area of control will be expanded to include approximately 85,000 acres (46% of the refuge) for the second and third years. A complete evaluation and reassessment of the control efforts will be conducted after a 3 year study. Annual progress reports will be written and circulated to all interested parties. The control of ravens, raccoons, and coyotes should increase the annual production and recruitment of sandhill cranes on Malheur NWR. This action will help the refuge meet annual production objectives of fledging 150 crane chicks.",
