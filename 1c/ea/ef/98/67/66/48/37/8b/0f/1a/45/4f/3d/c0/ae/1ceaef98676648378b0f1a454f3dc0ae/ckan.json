    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "&lt;p&gt;The need for electrostatic analyzers to measure ion and electron fluxes in near-Earth space is nearly ubiquitous in Heliophysics missions. In the latest example, NASA&amp;rsquo;s MMS mission slated for launch in 2014 features fully 32 electron and 32 ion spectrometers. These plasma measurements are central to the vast majority of such missions. The range of fluxes and energies to be covered is extremely wide, in view of the wide range of plasma conditions across the heliophysics realm. The GSFC Heliophysics Division enjoys a distinguished tradition of developing and flying these devices and is well placed to provide future leadership in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific and related thrusts within the field demand the development of minimum resource instrument work horses for future missions. Those are constellation missions and the development and proliferation of Cube-sats. The Cube-sats themselves may well comprise the elements of future constellations. Constellations, or groups of spacecraft providing networks of observation points, have been called for in both the current and past HPD roadmaps. Early, small number constellations have been realized with NASA&amp;rsquo;s Themis mission (5 sc) and ESA&amp;rsquo;s Cluster mission (4 sc). MMS itself is comprised of 4 sc. Future mission concepts call for constellations with many more sc. Realization of these concepts will require individual instruments and supporting spacecraft systems with phenomenally small physical resource requirements. Progress is being made quickly on the spacecraft system side, with lots of innovation evident in Cube-sat architectures, subsystems, and deployment systems. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The time to focus on resource minimization for work horse instruments is now!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching goal of this IRAD is to exploit the definition of clear simple and non-exceptional performance requirements with innovative design and fabrication techniques and, perhaps, a relatively high risk tolerance, to develop an ESA package design that will feature basic functionality over a wide range of energies and fluxes, with minimum physical resource requirements and a high level of manufacturability. We will pursue this goal by developing a package concept that can fit and operate in a 1U x 1U Cube-sat. Specific objectives of this first development year include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define minimalist science requirements for a low-resource, workhorse class ESA package for HPD missions that meet objectives in the proposed DIONE Cube-sat mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flow these down to a correspondingly minimalist set of HVPS requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design, develop, and demonstrate a prototype HVPS that meets defined requirements and fits within the volumetric envelope available in the proposed DIONE payload.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform a conceptual ion &amp;amp; electron ESA package design, based on a 1&amp;rdquo; dia. MCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct a feasibility study on use of additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) in manufacturing small, and very light weight miniature ESA and detector assemblies and/or components with sufficient strength and dimensional precision.&lt;/p&gt;",
