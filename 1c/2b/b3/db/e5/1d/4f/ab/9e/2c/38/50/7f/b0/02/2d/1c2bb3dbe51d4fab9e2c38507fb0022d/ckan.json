    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Encouraged by Phase I accomplishments, the proposed Phase II program will significantly mature and align the development of a Space Qualified Non-Destructive Evaluation &amp; Health Monitoring system with the needs of NASA. We are systematically working to improve the TRL to 5 at the end of Phase II and formulate commercialization and product development strategy beyond Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe proposed health monitoring system features three innovative technologies: excitation of preferential Lamb/Rayleigh wave modes; utilization of phased array concepts; and utilization of software algorithms rather than hardware for beam forming and signal analysis. The ability to detect cracks, corrosion, disbonds, and cracks under bolts for a stiffened panel was demonstrated in Phase I. The detection methods used were pitch-catch, pulse-echo, phased array, and electromechanical impedance.\r\n\r\nTo efficiently and cost-effectively achieve Phase II objectives, NextGen has teamed with Lockheed Martin Space Systems - Michoud Operations to test the proposed system in realistic environment. A cryogenic, composite LOX tank, built by Lockheed Martin for the X-34, is currently in a test fixture at NASA Marshall and will be used for evaluating our system. Additional tests will be performed to validate the durability and survivability of the system for space certification.",
