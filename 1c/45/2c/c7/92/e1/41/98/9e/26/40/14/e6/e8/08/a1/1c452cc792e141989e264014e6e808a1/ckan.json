  "notes": "The California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Vegetation Program produced a vegetation map and classification for approximately 35,000 acres including the town of Raymond and extending to Eastman Lake to the west, and surrounding Hensley Lake to the south (Madera and Mariposa Counties, California). CNPS delineated vegetation polygons using 2012 NAIP aerial imagery and CNPS survey data collected between 2008 to 2010, as well as field reconnaissance in 2014. The mapped area includes mostly private lands, as well as the properties adjacent to Eastman and Hensley Lakes which are managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The vegetation classification of 47 native vegetation alliances and semi-natural stands was based on data within the southern Sierra Nevada Foothills Ecoregion across a larger area of approximately 300,000 acres including portions of Mariposa, Madera, and Fresno Counties. The vegetation map resulted in 31 types of mapping units including alliance-level vegetation types from the floristic classification within the focused study area.",
