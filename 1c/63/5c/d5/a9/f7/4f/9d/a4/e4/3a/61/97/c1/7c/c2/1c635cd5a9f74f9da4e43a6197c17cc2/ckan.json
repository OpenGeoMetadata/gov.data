    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "Application of the proposed technology (an affordable, large-scale, high-efficiency, low-temperature pulse tube cryocooler system), serves two NASA needs: an improved cryogenic propellant conditioning method and an economical technique to maintain the lowest possible liquid propellant feed temperature.  These needs exist at a variety of NASA facilities, yet little progress has been made beyond laboratory development.  One barrier to acceptance is the cost of manufacturing large scale pulse tubes.  Sierra Lobo, Inc. has found that through previous research involving conventional manufacturing techniques, two particular components common to all pulse tube cryocoolers contribute to approximately 50&#37; of the cost.  In view of the February 24, 2004, Executive Order encouraging innovation in manufacturing related research and development via the SBIR program, the primary objective of Phase I of this research is to study and develop improvements to the existing pulse tube manufacturing process.  If successful, the resulting technology advancement would benefit a variety of current and future NASA programs managed by the Exploration Systems Office and the Science Mission Office, especially those involving long-term cryogenic storage systems.  An even greater benefit is expected for the commercial application of pulse tube cryocoolers in facilitating the advancement of distributed high-temperature superconducting power systems.",
