    "description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

  "notes": "The OMI/Aura level-2 near UV Aerosol data product 'OMAERUV', recently re-processed using an enhanced algorithm, is now released (April 2012) to the public. The data is available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaeruv_v003.shtml NASA Aura satellite sensors are tracking important atmospheric pollutants from space since its launch in July, 2004. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument(OMI), one of the four Aura satellite sensors with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides daily global measurements of four important US Environmental Protection Agency criteria pollutants (Tropospheric ozone, Nitrogen dioxide,Sulfur dioxide and Aerosols from biomass burning and industrial emissions, HCHO, BrO, OClO and surface UV irradiance. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal investigator (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). The Level-2 OMI Aerosol Product OMAERUV from the Aura-OMI is now available from NASAs GSFC Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) for public access. OMAERUV retrieval algorithm is developed by the US OMI Team Scientists. Dr. Omar Torres (GSFC/NASA) is the principal investigator of this product. The OMAERUV product contains Aerosol Absorption and Aerosol Extinction Optical Depths, and Single Scattering Albedo at three different wavelengths (354, 388 and 500 nm), Aerosol Index, and other ancillary and geolocation parameters, in the OMI field of view (13x24 km). Another standard OMI aerosol product is OMAERO, that is based on the KNMI multi-wavelength spectral fitting algorithm. OMAERUV files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMAERUV data product is about 6 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml A short OMAERUV Readme Document that includes brief algorithm description and currently known data quality issues is provided by the OMAERUV Algorithm lead (see http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaeruv_v003.shtml) For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/ . OMAERUV Data Groups and Parameters: The OMAERUV data file contains a swath which consists of two groups: Data fields: Total Aerosol Optical Depth (extinction optical depth) and Aerosol Absorption Optical Depths (at 354, 388 and 500 nm), Single Scattering Albedo, UV Aerosol Index, Visible Aerosol Index, and other intermediate and ancillary parameters (e.g. Estimates of Aerosol Total Extinction and Absorption Optical Depths and Single Scattering Albedo at five atmospheric levels, Aerosol Type, Aerosol Layer Height, Normalized Radiance, Lambert equivalent Reflectivity, Surface Albedo, Imaginary Component of Refractive Index) and Data Quality Flags. Geolocation Fields: Latitude, Longitude, Time(TAI93), Seconds, Solar Zenith Angles, Viewing Zenith Angles, Relative Azimuth Angle, Terrain Pressure, Ground Pixel Quality Flags. For the full set of Aura products available from the GES DISC, please see the link below. http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/ Atmospheric Composition data from Aura and other satellite sensors can be ordered from the following sites: http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/acdisc/ ",
